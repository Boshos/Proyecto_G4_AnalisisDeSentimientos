2025-08-15T07:18:32.026515Z,Purchased with the intent of boosting the cell coverage of a location in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis. We moved into a valley where an old golf coarse was. Very poor cell coverage so I looked into finding ways to create a safe communication tool without getting a land line. With a new home I was not in the mood to attach anything high up on the roof/window where the device might get a better signal to boost. I also was not interested in drilling holes in my new home to hid the wire...... so after limited increase in signal and satisfaction from my spouse I returned the device.,negative,low,

Yes it is, I like everything about this phone - the size, color, quality - but why in the world did RIM drop support for IM? That would have made it a megastar.. well a nice cam cant miss the wish list but we can live without those low range cameras. I had to shake my head twice after realizing I couldn't take my messaging to this device, not very thoughtful of RIM.",positive,low,calidad

In April of 2009 it stopped working correctly; I could hear them but they couldn't hear me. Called Motorola, they sent me a replacement as the original had a 1-year warranty. Unfortunately, the same problem happened to the replacement after 8 months. Called Motorola again; after being dropped multiple times by their automated system, finally talked to a live human.

The outbound audio is tinny and sometimes distorted. The earpieces designed to rest in the ear canal have been designed with too much tolerance in their interface with the base unit so when you twist them on, they easily fall off. This makes putting the device on your ear an extreme challenge. I finally had to use a small amount of adhesive to bond the earpiece to the device so it would not fall off every time I put in on my ear. This is a classic example of functional design coming up way short of very good aesthetic design. Don't bother buying this until they fix it.",positive,low,calidad
2025-08-15T07:18:32.129874Z,"This is possibly the best bluetooth I have ever owned. It can function as a standalone headset while still playing wireless audio or you can add the attachment for wireless stereo music. It comes with multiple ear attachments to fit different exterior ear shapes and interior ear sizes. Very durable which is what really amazes me. I inadvertantly dropped this thing in the middle of a snow storm at my home and thought, ""Oh, crap. I just lost $80."" I waited a moth later and I found the head set after the snow melted. I charged it, used it, and it worked just like new! I was amazed at this little things hardiness considering it also takes daily beatings from my 1 and 3 year old. The sound quality is excellent and does not receive much interfernce like others I have used. If my bluetooth music skips it usually isbecause the cellular radio on my phone is on which interfers on most any cell phone, so if it is off it plays flawlessly. It works well at a distance up to the advertised 30 feet and syncs nicely to my PC. It has the AD2P functionality with I believe 2.1 BT firmware. It stays nicely in your ear so you can hear your audience well and does not move much if fitted properly to your ear, even when running though I would not recommend it for jogging. I wish this used a normal USB mini charger but if that is the only fault that is pretty good. As for the buttons and media functions like voice dialing and pause/play/next the headset works very well although not as well on Android phones. By this I mean that sometime you need it hit buttons twice to make it work and sometimes the audio does not pick up on command but call quality and music quality are very good. Windows Mobile phones work flawlessly with it as I'm sure Blackberrys and other smart phone would. I will note the first one I got (which I admit was used) worked terribly after a month, but you pay for what you get which is especially true with bluetooth headsets. I have seen others go as high as $200 and yet this one works well for an average pricing. I have bought headsets for $10, $30, $80, and $200 and more often than not the more you pay for it the better it works. Happy listening.

2025-08-15T07:18:32.170768Z,"UPDATED Feb 9th 2008: Well the BT5020 is now dead, I'm sending it back to jabra and we will see from there what happens. Following my initial review I returned the unit for replacement once and that fixed some of the sound issues, not all of them but enough that I was acceptably pleased. Over the 6 months I found the unit to be functional and seldom did it offer me reason to complain, the sound was clear and I could be heard without many ever offering complaint, unless I was outdoors in a wind, but I think some aspects are to be understood and tolerated. I will note though, using the dual connection capability was nice, but glitchy, especially when hooked to a nextel and using direct connect, then things truly got fouled up and generally connections were lost to the phones and often calls. Over all I won't lower or raise my review on this unit, it worked when it worked and while far from stellar, I think for 30 bucks it was acceptable. ________________________________________________________________ I'm new to the BT ear piece market, this being my second in the past few months. My first was/is the Jabra BT500, which is very enjoyed... once I got used to tolerating the eargel discomfort, and no adjustability for fit. So my hopes were high with the BT5020, in getting rid of the eargels and allowing for some angle and length of speaker position, would fix my comfort levels. So my first impressions of the BT5020 was wow, this is comfortable, it weighs less, no eargel and the size is very balanced with the over all package. Turned on the power and it started in pair mode, and paired without a glitch or bump with my Sanyo 8400. So far so good, I was working in the yard, so decided to leave it on and see how I liked the fit and feel. And to speak straight, I forgot I had it on and got the sudden reminder of it real quick when my wife called, the vibrate alert went off (I'd forgotten it had vibrate alert) and I nearly came unglued tell I recalled what was doing it. This thing is that comfortable, no feeling like my ear is plugged up, no strange pulling or pushing, or slippage to keep telling me I have something on/in my ear. The phone call however set off the first warning signs, there was very distinct static and crackling, this with my phone on my hip on the same side as the earpiece. I kept it in mind but kept working for a few hours before deciding to go and really play with my new earpiece. I started conducting some tests around the house, called customer service of my phone company, and figured to kill two birds with one stone. I had the phone on a shelf at the same level as my ear, about 3 feet away. The static wasn't noticed this time so I began moving around the room and it returned. After 9-12 feet distance, the static was so bothersome that if the CSR had answered, I'd not have been able to conduct business. I tried moving it closer and at different angles with varying results and little improvement. Static wasn't noticed as a background noise or white noise type, but direct distortion of voice and or background music (I was on hold a while), it changed with the volume/beat of the sound I was supposed to be hearing clearly. To say the least, right now I'm not pleased; I truly like the feel, fit, weight and appearance of this headset. There is a notable creak from the flexible portion but nothing I will notice after a few days of using something. The button position for those used to the BT500, as I am, is a little different as it is a bit harder to tap the answer/end button, for you can't really just pinch the end of the mic area and catch the button, as you can with the BT500, but those are small things and a few days of playing will pan out if they become larger issues. I've worn wired headsets for years, mostly Plantronic or Jabra versions'; so moving to BT has been a learning experience. I'm not going to give up on the BT5020 just yet, I'm going to further test it over the weekend, at work where I'll have multiple other phones and radios on or around my person, at times talking on various radios of various frequencies. I think this will truly tell me if the BT5020 can hold mustard, or if it gets packed up on Monday and sent back, something I'm usually ill tolerant of doing unless something is truly truly broken and/or a turd.",negative,high,calidad

Pushing the Call button will automatically dial the last person called, while holding the same button down for 2-3 seconds then releasing it will allow you to use voice commands, and the same button held down for just a little longer will shut the unit off. This may cause issues if you keep calling the same number or can't figure out why the voice command feature isn't coming up because you weren't paying attention to the length of time you pressed the call button.

2025-08-15T07:18:32.225590Z,"I should start by saying this is my first Bluetooth device, so I was pleased at how easily this paired to my phone (Samsung Galaxy S -- another reviewer complained that Samsung didn't allow third-party device pairing, which obviously is no longer true) following the instruction manual (whose usefulness sadly sort of ends there). I should also say I didn't pay full retail but rather bought through a Hong Kong eBay seller -- waited an eternity for shipping but got a real bargain, especially considering the device is far from perfect and not exactly worth full price. First and foremost, battery life. The description promises 8 hours? After two full charging cycles, I'm lucky to squeeze 3-1/2 to 4 out of it. Maybe that will improve over time, but doubling? I'm skeptical. Of course, it seems to give another hour or more of use after the low battery starts alarming, the problem is that's with an audible chime every 30 seconds or so that interrupts your music and is impossible to ignore. There's nothing in the manual about disabling this so I doubt it's possible. Second, the play/pause and rewind buttons are a bit hit-or-miss. Not a dealbreaker, but I would have felt a little shafted if I had paid full retail. I was a tad disappointed in the range. I had hoped to use this while working nights at a vet hospital, but concrete walls proved too great an obstacle. Works well with the phone in the room with me though. Those are my only complaints really. The volume is great, even a little too loud at times. The hands-free works well and my callers say I sound fine. I like keeping this tucked under my shirt while biking and eliminating the obtrusive headphone wire extending all the way to my handlebars, and I can correctly hit the buttons through my shirt about 90% of the time thanks to the ridged edges. I especially love that I set this up with my Tasker app so just connecting the BT automatically launches my bike computer app, turns on GPS, maximizes my screen brightness and media volume, and disables screen timeout*. In short, a cool little toy but don't settle for full retail price. 2-week update: It seems like the battery life is getting worse rather than better. Occasionally will get a ""bum connection"" where music stutters or puts weird choppy cuts in that screw up the beat, fixed by unpairing and re-pairing. With these shortcomings, I think they really have some stones asking such a high retail price for this thing. *This might be more of an endorsement for Tasker.",positive,low,precio|envío

Problem is, if you take advantage of all the iPhone features (especially video streaming, or heavy photography) you can run through electrons pretty quickly. I previously used a Battery Case extender which is manufactured by a popular company, and really had no problems with it. The big ""but"" is, I'm an active guy; gym, running, and hiking. Most of the battery style cases don't offer much in the way of protection from moisture either from sweat, or the unanticipated rain shower while outside. I obtained an Otterbox Defender case, which I have found provides the best all around protection from both drops, scratches, and also moisture. Moving the phone between the two became a huge hassle just to get the phone charged up, and also I lost moisture protection when using the battery case. Enter the New Trent IMP500, which I found on Amazon.com and was intrigued by the large capacity given its' size. I purchased one, and also a Griffin coiled USB to 30pin Apple sync cable. I carry the IMP500 and coiled cord in a discreet runner's belt under my shirt which keeps it close at hand without committing the dreaded Fanny Pack fashion faux pas. The IMP500 comes with an retractable USB charging cable, with mini-USB and micro-USB adapters. This cable can be used both for charging the unit, or in reverse for powering any device utilizing a micro or mini-USB port (virtually all non-Apple wireless phones). I can plug in my Bluetooth headset when the unit isn't needed to power my iPhone. The construction seems sturdy, and the corners are rounded so that it can be carried close to the body, or in a pocket without generating discomfort. It features an on/off switch, and also a row of LEDs to indicate the unit's state of charge. At 5000mAh rating, it should provide several recharges to the iPhone without needed juice itself. I now have no hesitation at going on an overnight hike, and even using the iPhone GPS unit for navigation as I know I have a couple recharges left. As time passes, I hope I will be able to report more on the durability of the unit and also how well the battery retains it's rechargeability and life.",positive,low,

A bit awkward for eyeglass weares to put on, but no big deal. Volume controls are also a bit hard to feel and use. Sound quality was very good, and never had a complaint from my callers.

Sure, any writer is proud to be asked for his take, but how could I adequately review a regulatory cost recovery fee? I mean, nobody likes to pay fees. But this fee in particular is perhaps not as bad as the rest. You see, I'm one of those rare people who thinks regulations are a good idea. Especially utility regulations. Anyone who lived in California while Enron was bleeding electrical customers dry probably agrees that regulation is ultimately best. And this is the weird problem with cell phones: generally you aren't charged for long distance, hence the taxes usually charged for long distance can't be charged. The government was forced to put a fee on cell phone service. Now I know many of you are against taxes; I don't like paying taxes either. But ultimately, taxes and fees pay for a lot of things we take for granted, like utility regulations that keep our phone companies from bleeding us dry (for now). Frankly, I wish that most taxes and fees (especially payroll taxes) in favor of a steep progressive income tax that primarily taxed the wealthy, along with an estate tax that forced every American to start on a level playing field. Now THAT would be equal opportunity. But under our current tax system, this fee isn't so bad. Three stars out of five seems about right, although I hope the government starts regulating these insane text message rip-offs soon. Yahoo sends me a text message every day to ""check out the world cup at fifa.com."" Hey thanks! Nobody likes to pay a fee, but if nobody paid them, I'm sure we'd get totally screwed.

2025-08-15T07:18:32.807498Z,"This product is a mixed success in comfort. The band is comfortable on your neck, but the ear occluding earpieces are not as comfortable. As normal, the Motorola brand Bluetooth link works very well and the battery life is good. However, there are 2 problems - the earpieces suffer from the ""occlusion effect"", and 2 the stiff wires have bad touch noise. The ""occlusion effect"" is how your own voice sounds in your ears when you stick your fingers in your ear - you hear your own voice loudly, hear yourself swallow, and can even hear yourself breathe. The occlusion effect is undesirable in quiet environments and particularly if you are eating chips! Additionally, having the ear canal occluded makes the earpieces VERY sensitive to touch noise - touching the earpiece or when the stiff wire brushes against your collar produces a medium loudness scratchy noise in your ear. I understand why an occluded earpiece was used - because it can deliver great bass with extremely low power from the internal audio amplifier - but the occluded earpiece is annoying for long duration wear compared to buds that just sit in the bowl of your ear. It is possible to reduce the occlusion effect partly at the expense of bass and sound isolation by putting a hole the size of a pencil tip in the rubber earseal to allow it to vent to the outside. This is particularly useful if your intention is to listen to audio books.",negative,low,

I like it well enough that when my local phone store stopped carrying it, I went online and searched until I found one I could special order!

Honestly, I don't know how any phone can be too confusing. The pictures are great. I bought a ringtone ($2.99 is pricy, T-Moble charged me $1.99 for the past 3 years) and a game. I really do hate that Verizon Wireless phones do not come with default games. After 2-3 months, my cancel button stopped working. I'd come back if I didn't close the phone, but then eventually it completely stopped working. Like another reviewer, it would constantly call the last person on my call log. It can be so sensitive, but yet not sensitive enough for the cancel button (sensor pad) to work. I would be typing a text message and before I could even finish one sentence, it would automatically send. Sometimes, it would scroll down the menus non stop until I just closed it. It would also freeze while I would do something, so I would have to close the phone and open it up again. The music player was great. You really need a memory card to get the total use of this ""MP3 player/cellphone"" I get my new phone in the mail today and one of the screws on the back of the phone (where the battery goes) was missing. The factory sent me a phone that was either NOT inspected, or had a terrible inspection job. I understand it's just a screw, but that's just plain lazy. Also, the pictures I have saved on my card do not cover the entire wallpaper like on my old phone. I do not understand this. If you have a lot of money to spend, I guess this is a good phone for you.

The sound quality was excellent, both sending and receiving, and I was congratulating myself on finding the perfect headset. Then... The following Thursday, the headset started dropping connections with the phone in mid-call. Thinking that it could be the phone, I continued to use the headset, trying to work through the issue. By Saturday, it would not connect to the phone at all. Investigation showed that the battery was dead, even though the headset had been on the charger overnight. Subsequent charging had no effect.

As I plugged in my earpiece to charge via the company supplied USB cable connected to my computer, I walked away and started to notice a burning smell. As I looked around to find the source, I saw smoke coming from my earpiece. The connection from the earpiece to the charging cable had melted. I unplugged the cable from my computer and moved the earpiece into the garage in case the battery was on fire and could explode. I then called Jawbone to let them know of the situation and if there was a service department that I could send the earpiece to for trouble shooting. The person on the other end of the phone told me that the charger was not meant to be used with a computer, really? 1: The user manual states: You can charge your Jawbone headset via the wall charger, or via USB on your computer. It shows a couple pics, one of the wall plug and one of the computer with nice little arrows pointing where you can plug it in. I know the spiel, give the company memo so as to lay blame on the consumer, great motto, profit over people. Works on the uneducated and those who are ignorant enough to believe you have their best interests in mind. I then explained I wasn't looking for a replacement as it's a few years old, I just wanted to send it in so they could identify the problem, nope, not something they deal with. So long story short, Jawbone won't correct problems in their products. The fire could have been caused by faulty connections in either the headset or charger, bad soldering, cheap wiring, but hey, why would they want to know that? Maybe because these could be components still in use by your company and you might, you know, want to fix something that can cost someone their home or their life? Jawbone makes a great product, no doubt, but without a hint of integrity and a profit over people corporate attitude, I won't be buying their products ever again.",negative,low,

This is connected to the main body on one side and not very well. The single point of connection had been severed due to the simple swing of the power cord! I don't recommend this product. If you are looking for a GPS, please consider one of the products that has a much stronger power connection. While this one should last the warranty, it will likely break soon after with limited usage. The Garmin website allows people to ship an ensured package back to the dealer (shipping roughly $10-20) and have it repaired for $50. Not worth it in my opinion. I'm going to try some surgery on it, but will likely end up buying a different product.",negative,high,precio|envío

Under the same conditions, using my trusty old wired Plantronics M214C Headset, I never have any complaints and people tell me I sound best / clearest when I use it (the old, wired, Plantronics M214C Headset).

I don't like getting tangled in the wires, and I've been frustrated with headset jacks that suffer from wear (and now I have to contend with an adapter to mini-USB in addition) but, ultimately, it's about hearing the other person on the line and having them be able to hear you, too.",negative,low,calidad

I watch CNN, FOX News, E!, etc. You can even watch The Disney Channel live and use video on demand to choose a certain episode of the show to watch from a list of episodes. This is a good feature for long car trips or bus trips if you get bored. BAD: * It is hard to hang up. You have to hit the end button 2 or 3 times to disconnect. * When watching TV you better have headphones because the sound is loud and if you hit the down button it goes mute. I had to cover the speaker on the back with my thumb just so I could hear without it blasting thru my whole office. * If you want to use headphones good luck because there is no headphone jack. You have to buy a separate mini-USB to headphone jack adapter. And you'll need one kind if you want to listen to TV or music (the stereo kind) and one kind if you want to use a phone headset (the mono kind). * They put the volume, camera, and ""action"" button on the flip part of the phone, so when you go to flip open the phone you hit these buttons with your fingers. I've accidentally disconnected people before just trying to get the phone open. On the left side of the phone you have just one inch of free space to open the phone. So you have to be very careful opening it so you don't hit any of these buttons. * No address book searching as another reviewer mentioned. You can filter by ""friends"", ""family"", etc. but theres no search feature. Happy scrolling! * Very hard to get to the mini SD card. * Front screen is black when not in use so you can't see the time unless you press a button or open the phone. Other phones I've had you could always see the time on the front.",negative,low,calidad

Just need to get a pre-paid SIM chip locally. - Can be charged from laptop using included USB cable. - It's BLACK. THE OK ====== - Passable voice quality. (Maybe it's just because it's GSM technology, and coverage is not fantastic in outside of cities.) - Slim profile, though a little heavier than my previous handset - Nice colors in screen. Great ringtone sounds. Though these are pretty standard nowadays. - Decent bluetooth range. Paired this with a Jabra BT800 headset and I can run into the coin laundry with my ear piece and still connect with the phone in the car outside. THE BAD ======= - Short battery life. 7 hours talk-time as advertised is a imaginary. Phone starts to beep after 2-3 hrs of talking. - Organizer (calendar, alarm, notes, contacts) doesn't sync correctly with Outlook. - Oily screens!! The inside and outside screens and the metallic keypad get oily fingerprints after every use (is it just my skin?!) Looks yucky and kinda destroys all the aesthetics. Tried wiping now and then but notice minor scratches start to accumulate. (My clothes are not always cotton and I don't usually carry eye glass cloth.) - Low camera resolution. Other new phones have close to twice that resolution. Pics always kinda dark. - Camera doesn't take video. - No MP3 or radio.

The problem is that the Treo 600 is the most fragile phone I've ever encountered. A drop from even 12"" will break the display, which isn't replacable or covered by the warantee. Your only solution: buy a new phone. Sprint are amazingly unhelpful here. They are more than happy to sell you a new replacement phone to fulfill your contract ($600), but that's it. If you press them, Sprint will sell you a ""cheap"" phone to continue your contract for only $150, but they will not repair a Treo 600. Moving on to coverage, I found that in the San Jose area, Sprint had lousy coverage. When pressed, Sprint will insist that there are new towers coming on line every day, but over the course of a year I only saw the signal strength get worse. If you must buy the Sprint version of the Treo 600, BUY THE INSURANCE. Over the course of a two-year contract, you will replace the phone at least once. Ask youself this: would you rather pay $5 a month for insurance, $600 to replace a broken phone, or $150 to buy out your contract and start over with a new carrier? Bottom line: the Treo 600 is a great phone if you're willing to treat it like it's made of glass. When it breaks, you'll have to deal with Sprint's abysmal customer service. If Palm can solve their manufacturing problems, they'll have a winner. Until then, but the insurance and the best protective case you can find.",negative,high,precio|calidad

2025-08-15T07:18:34.457025Z,"A lot of people are complaining about this headset. I share some of their views, but this is still a good headset. Sadly, I may have to stop using it and search for another. I have had a few bluetooth headsets in the past, and have had trouble hearing with all of them. I would love to use a headset like the Motorola H700 (my wife uses that one and loves it). BUT, those headsets are not very adjustable. I have large ears--and when wearing headsets like the H700, the speaker is a good 1/2"" or more AWAY from the opening to my ear canal... The result is I cannot hear a phone conversation, even at max volume, when there is ambient noise. I drive a 1999 Jeep Grand Cherokee, which is a rather loud ride at 70mph, and I just can't hear well... Now with the Jawbone, I could hear. Some complain that the headset is painful. I have experienced this myself. HOWEVER--if you take some time to carefully bend and adjust the metal ear-hook, you will find that the jawbone is both comfy and will sit quite well on your head. The speaker is near my ear, so I can hear well. Now the bad-the durability of both the hook and the earpiece are awful. The unit ships with a 6 or 8 hooks (I forget--its 3 or 4 for each left or right ear). I have already broken 2 of them. Once I break this one, which I am sure I will, I will have to pony up another $10 to buy another set of hooks. I like to keep the headset in my pocket--and in doing so the hook will bend over time. That means I may have to bend it back to re-adjust the hook to fit my ear well. Bend a piece of metal enough and it will snap. The only way to stop this would be to wear the headset constantly or keep the headset in some other pocket away from any potential forces... The other piece of crappy hardware is the earbud. None of the earbuds were that great a fit for me, but I picked the best one I could find. The earbuds have a rubber portion (that touches your ear). The other side is a hard plastic connector--you place the earbud on the jawbone, and turn 90 degrees to attach it. This mechanism doesn't work. When placing the jawbone on your ear, you will often rub the earbud to your ear, which sometimes turns the earbud. Turn it 90 degrees, and it will fall off. As time goes, this attachment mechanism will wear down, making the earbud move around with even less force, meaning it will fall off constantly.... I just ordered the Jabra EarGels, hoping that they will be much better earbuds, and maybe secure enough to use without the hook. Who knows. As it is, I like the headset when the hook and earbud aren't BROKEN. But, I refuse to spend $10 for new hooks, and $10 for new earbuds each time they break... I want a headset that can be stored in blue-jean pockets without being destroyed!! Maybe the next version will eliminate these issues!",negative,high,precio|calidad

2025-08-15T07:18:34.488215Z,"The short version: rubbish! Way too quiet (especially in-call audio), poor audio quality (obnoxious noise on output) and worse outgoing speech quality. The longer version: Let me start by saying that the premise of the Kensington LiquidAUX Bluetooth car kit is a great one. You can stream music via Bluetooth's A2DP profile to your car stereo's aux connection, and the car kit will also route calls to your stereo, handling muting of music automatically. If only it worked as well as its premise. This was tested in my wife's Scion xB (an '06 - the smaller original version) with the factory head unit (a Scion-badged Pioneer) and an iPhone 3GS. My first impression upon connecting this up in my wife's car was that this would be a cool little car kit - installation and pairing was simple. However, that impression died as soon as I tried to start running audio through it. First of all, the audio from the car kit is way too quiet when playing music. On my wife's head unit, a volume setting of about 15 is reasonable for the radio at any speed, and 20 starts to get obnoxiously loud. CDs tend to be a little quieter on this system, but 20 or so is a reasonable volume for those. To reach a similar music volume from this car kit, this stereo has to be turned up to 40 or so. Worse, the call audio is even quieter, if that's possible. To make a call even vaguely audible, the stereo's volume has to be pushed up north of 50. Even then, it's still way too quiet. This is unforgivable as this is intended to be a completely hands-free kit. In order to hear a call, you have to reach for the stereo to turn the volume up at the start of the call, then you have to scramble to turn it way down again to avoid having your head taken off when the call ends and the music starts again. This is an enormous distraction for a device that's supposed to reduce the driver's workload. This isn't a function of this stereo's Aux input, either. We've run an iPod shuffle to the aux input for over a year now without having to crank the volume up beyond what's needed for a CD. I also tested the iPhone from its headphone output, and that was reasonable, too. I'm not really a fan of doing that, though - you usually have to turn the headphone volume way up to get the signal anywhere close to a standard line output, and that more or less guarantees that you'll forget to lower the volume afterwards and will subsequently have your head taken off the next time you plug your headphones in. Anyway, I digress. It's all a bit academic, however, as even if you can hear the person on the other end of the line, there's almost no chance whatsoever that they can hear you. Since the microphone is part of the body that plugs into the cigarette lighter, it's likely a decent distance away from the driver, and all the noise cancellation in the world isn't going to help that tiny little mic pick up anything. This might be a side-effect of the raised seating position in the xB, but that's hardly uncommon with the number of SUVs and minivans on the road. A much better idea would have been a remote mic that you could stick somewhere on the dash, but perhaps Kensington was afraid of liability having extra cords running about the place. If that wasn't bad enough, there's another major problem with audio quality. There simply isn't enough filtering between the input power and the output audio, and the inherently noisy power source leaks through to your stereo. This might not be so bad if there was a ton of signal to swamp it and make it unnoticeable, but because everything's so quiet, signal/noise is abysmal. On my wife's car, I can hear a higher-pitch whine that varies directly with engine speed (this is probably straight from the alternator, but who knows?) plus a bunch of periodic clicks that also vary with rpm. This is plain annoying when playing music, but is cranked up to irritating and beyond during a call - remember, with the stereo turned way up to compenstate for the quiet calls, all that noise just gets louder. Unfortuately, I made the mistake of initially testing the car kit on battery power only before turning it over to my wife, so all I really noticed was the quiet audio. Let me put it this way: my two year-old was asking what all the funny noise was in the car. That's not a good sign, Kensington. Another ominous sign is that I'm not going to even bother rating the quality of the audio delivered over A2DP. Does it sound badly compressed? Who cares? I reached the limit of my patience with the car kit's other audible flaws long before I even started caring about how A2DP sounds. Oops. Another good premise is the little remote that comes with the system. However, this is a waste of time with the iPhone 3GS. The play/pause button does what you'd expect on the iPod side of the phone, and the call button will answer an incoming call when phone rings and will end the a call in progress. However, unlike many Bluetooth devices, the call button has no other function on the iPhone. Additionally, because the call audio is so quiet, I've hung up on a lot of people because I didn't hear anything, so I hit the call button again. Maybe that's for the best as it means I don't have to go through the whole ""Hello?...(hello?)...Hello?...(hello?)"" routine that this car kit seems to induce. A lot of headsets allow you to use voice dialling, etc. if you press and hold the call button. Not so with the iPhone - even though voice control was added in the most recent version of the OS (3.0), this button has no effect on the iPhone when no call is in progress. That's a huge pity, as voice control actually works fairly well. Additionally, the forward/back buttons have no effect on an iPhone. Where the blame for this lies, I'm not sure. I've seen suggestions that although Apple added A2DP to the iPhone, they didn't bother with AVRCP (A/V remote control profile). This would seem to make sense, and unfortunately makes the remote somewhat pointless. I'm also not convinced that the steering wheel is a good place for the remote. Personally, I wouldn't mind mounting it on the stalk for the wipers, but the rubber doohickey that the remote mounts in is obviously sized for a steering wheel and can't be secured to a stalk. I could take the remote out of its mount and stick it somewhere on the dash, but frankly, given this device doesn't actually have a future in my wife's car, I'm not going to bother. As far as I'm concerned, this was money flushed straight down the drain. Thankfully, I'm still within Amazon's return period, so I can offload it that way. Otherwise, I would just have to eat the cost, as I can't in good faith pawn it off on someone through eBay or whatever. It really is just that bad. Either way, it's going to get ripped out of my wife's car. This is the first doodad I think we've ever had that's basically scored a zero on the Wife Acceptance Factor scale, which is impressive, albeit for all the wrong reasons. Ugh.",negative,low,calidad

Another point of frustration I've experienced with the razr is an increase in the voice echo when speaking with other cell phones, although I'm not certain if the fault is the phones or my current networks' issue. Overall, I feel like this phone is a reasonable purchase for 100 dollars for an unlocked phone and I'm satisfied with it.

The basic functionality is that it lets you use your home phone to talk on skype. When you get a skype call, your home phone rings. It works simultaneously with a land line as well. You can have skype and your land line connected at the same time. When you get a skype call your phone will ring differently than when a landline call comes in. It also acts like call waiting. If you're on a skype call and you get a regular call, you'll hear beeps just like call waiting and can flip between the two calls. It works with answering machines too. Incoming calls will ring the same number of times as your landline calls and your answering machine will pick up and they can leave a message just like a regular call. The advanced features are amazing. You can setup the Call Center for skype call forwarding. I have mine set to ring 4 times and if I don't pick up at home, it will use my landline to call my cellphone and connect the skype call. I no longer worry about being at home to take a skype call. The next cool feature is using the Call Center to allow you to make skype calls from any phone on the planet. With this feature enabled, the Call Center will answer your landline phone after a certain number of rings. It can make your PC act like an answering machine. When the greeting comes on, you can type in a secret pin code on the phone and it will then let you dial a skype call and connect you. Picture this: you're at work and have urgent news for your family in another country. Instead of making an international call or going home to make the call, you dial your home phone. The Call Center answering machine on your PC picks up. You punch in your pin and dial your skype speed dial number for your family and the call center connects you. You are now making an international phone call even though you're only paying for the call to your house. When you receive skype calls at home, the skype ID of the person calling will show up on your home phone caller ID. Setup is simple. 1) Install Skype and set it up on your pc 2) Install the software on the CD that came with the Call Center 3) Setup advanced Call Center features on your pc if you want to (it's optional). 4) Connect the Call Center USB cable to your computer 5) Connect your home phone to the Call Center 6) (optional) Connect your landline phone wire to the call Center That's it. You're now in business. Using this box has really improved my life! My parents in europe are not computer savvy and would have NEVER used skype regularly as it is complicated and confusing to them. Now if they want to talk to me, they just pick up the phone and dial ##1. If I want to call them, their phone rings just like normal.

2025-08-15T07:18:34.746583Z,"Others have noted quite a bit, and as such there are featuers I haven't bothered to pay for, but as to the things I have used the phone for, I would say it's ok for a free phone, but not worth paying for. As to the primary functionality, I haven't had problems with calls at all. Navigation is pretty simple. It's sturdy and I like the button for opening it. If you just want a phone to work as a phone, this one isn't too bad. The camera on this phone is essentially useless. The quality is so bad that you're likely not to bother using it. I tried using it for fun for a while, but found that nothing came out well so just stopped. I loved having the radio on the phone for my walk to the subway. I could catch up on some news. But then the phone stopped recognizing that the ear piece was plugged in. I got a replacement phone, but the same thing happened to the replacement after a month or so. To have a picture ID a person, you need to have the person's info locally on the phone, not on the card. Phone numbers when added are defaulted locally, which was a problem when I switched phones and had to move all my contacts to the card. While this seems to be typical, games are pointless. You can play for a few minutes / levels, then you have to pay. I don't understand why a couple simple games can't be included.",negative,low,calidad

After installing the external antenna on the roof and pointing it at the nearest cell tower (thanks to [...] for coordinates), I was thrilled that I had service with my Verizon Droid phone. I had to stay within 6' of the indoor antenna, but that was OK. Unfortunately, I had to turn in my company-owned phone (I retired) and replaced it with the LG Cosmos (still Verizon). Although it showed 3-4 bars, it would not send or receive calls and text messages. Thinking it was a flaw with the phone, Verizon replaced the LG Cosmos. Same problem. Once or twice I was able to make a call. I will say that tech support at Wilson Electronics was extremely helpful but they were at a loss as to why the DT Signal Booster wouldn't work with the LG phone but did with the Droid. I finally bought a network extender from Verizon which works through my internet connection. After rebate, it's $100. It works great and gives me coverage throughout the house and the yard. However, it only works with Verizon phones (not a problem for me). I know people who have used Wilson boosters and have had great results. It just didn't work out for me.",positive,low,precio
2025-08-15T07:18:34.774700Z,"I got this phone based on a recommendation from AT&T :( silly me. I wanted a back up phone my wife could use in case her other phone failed to turn on (also a motorola different model almost 5x price). They recommend this phone because of it's low cost and it's a go phone so you only pay for minutes you use. I bought the phone and loved it. It was very low cost, came with airtime. It feels very solid, except for the battery cover which seems flimsy but seems to hold up with no problems. It had what I felt as good sound quality and a good number of features for such a low cost phone. I wanted to prep the battery since my wife was going to travel soon, so I left it powered on and would constantly press a button so the light would stay on and drain the battery. The display is amazingly bright, I could almost use it as a flashlight. I was also really surprised at the battery life. Anyhow after two cycles of draining the battery and then charging it to full, I figured it would be all set to use as an emergency phone for my wife who was going on a two week business trip. Wrong :( on the last day of her trip her main cell phone battery was low so she decided to try to use the back up phone. It wouldn't turn on :( I don't know if it was due to the xray machines at the airports or what but the battery was drained. She said she never turned it on at all until that day so maybe it got turned on accidently in her purse (phone turns on by pressing a button on the front for 4 or 5 seconds). Anyhow to make matters worse the AT&T rep also said I could also use it as a main phone by transfering the SIM. Nope didn't work either, I was on the older AT&T plan so I had to be migrated. Atleast the phone didn't cost too much. I figure I can still keep it as an emergency 911 phone too (Go phone minutes expire :( which the AT&T rep didn't tell me about).

2025-08-15T07:18:34.844605Z,"I've had Nokia, Sony-Ericsson, and Motorola phones - and each has had features that I found to be incredibly useful. I've heard a lot about Samsung phones in the international community and I was excited when I saw that T-Mobile began offering this phone. I was hoping it would be a combination of all that I ever wanted in a phone - but I was disappointed. To begin with, this phone looks great. Well-built, sturdy, and with a high-gloss finish that screams class it received many compliments every time I brought it out. The screen is bright and delivers detailed images and video. By far, this is the nicest screen I've seen on any portable product - including the iPod Video. It slides open and closes smoothly, and the keypad it reveals is backlit and easy to see in the dark. As an MP3 player, it delivers crisper sound than I heard from my Nokia 6600. The Bluetooth worked flawlessly and instanly hooked up with my other phones and my laptop. The camera is as good as any other cell phone camera that promises 1.3MP. In short, what this phone promised ... it delivered. However, I was disappointed mainly because it appeared that the user interface was not as cleverly designed as the physical package. The phonebook only allows three phone entries per name. Looking up names, you can only search by typing the first letters of the last name. For example, suppose you have an entry for ""John Smith"" - if you use the search feature and type in ""Jo"" it will NOT list all the Johns. You have to search for ""Sm.."". Why? Sure you can sort the phone by either the first or last name, but you can only search using one or the other. Not both. My Nokia and Ericsson could do both. Another phonebook problem - suppose you've just called someone's home and now you want to call their cell. You have to start the search over. It doesn't remember your last search. Headset works fine. But if you have the headset on and the phone rings, you don't hear the ring through the earpiece. The phone rings normally and you activate the call by pressing the button on the headset. That sort of negates the purpose. You can listen to MP3s using the headset, but since the headset uses a proprietary connector, you can't use your ""good"" headphones. Maybe when the phone becomes more popular, adapters to standard headphones will be made. The keys under the screen aren't soft - meaning they cannot be reassigned. The left button opens the menu and the right buttom opens the phonebook. My Nokia let me reassign these keys - so, because I use SMS a lot, I could assign one key to open up the message center. Speaking of keys - the entire keypad is nearly flat. This makes it hard to ""feel"" for a key (while driving for example). I don't have particularly large fingers, but I found myself making a lot of mistakes. Another irritating problem - each menu option has a submenu but the submenus have no relation to one another. (This is a hard one to explain). For example, you are going through your list of audio files. You want to delete one. You click ""Options"" and you get a submenu of seven items. #6 is ""Delete"". You can scroll down, but it is faster to just type in the number 6 as a shortcut. So far so good. Now, you are going through your text messages. You want to delete one. The submenu shows the delete as #7. You want to delete a phonebook entry, the delete is #4 in the submenu. No consistency makes it very hard to use shortcuts. All my prior phones had a dedicated ""Clear"" button that can be used anywhere - but if the people at Samsung don't want to ""waste"" a button, they should've at least made the submenus more consistent. By the way, everytime you delete something it asks you if you want to delete ""All or Selected"" - this is an unnecessary step. You can listen to MP3s, but you can't use them as ringtones unless they are converted to 3gp. This is as easy as changing the extention from .mp3 to .3gp on your computer before uploading the song (via bluetooth or USB). Why the extra step? Battery life is terrible. As expected, using the MP3/video player causes a serious drain on your power. One thing I found weird - after listening to MP3s on the phone during a 1-hour flight, the phone became quite warm. I'm not sure if this will affect the phone's general life-span. The beautiful case looks shiny and great - but it smudges really easily. If you aren't using a headset and you have to press this phone to your ear, be prepared for major smudgeness - especially after a long phone call. Another weird thing - you can only use the supplied charger to charge this phone. Even if you have another Samsung phone, you can't use another phone's charger. All my Nokia phones used the same charger. I ended up returning the phone on the last day of my 14-day trial period. It just didn't deliver what I needed, and the annoyances were just too much for me. I am still waiting for the perfect phone - one that combines the best features of all the other phones. I want the appearance of this Samsung (I love the way it looks and feels), but I want the features in all the other phones. I also want it to use standard plugs.",negative,low,

The headliner is not straight across and the drivers side headliner hangs down about 3 more inches than the passenger side.

I checked my phone and the bars did not change. I called Wilson and they walked me through the Gain settings. The Wilson representative asked if I checked my phone and explained to me that since I have 4G, the bars on my phone won't show the boosted change. I was very skeptical. Well, no worries, he was right. The signal works great. It has been over 6 months since I installed the booster and have had no dropped calls. I went from daily dropped calls to zero dropped calls.

2025-08-15T07:18:34.997222Z,"After considerable research, I finally took the plunge and purchased my first smartphone, Motorola's Q Global 9h. I had used a PDA off and on but was disenchanted with docking stations, stylus usage, and carrying both a phone and a PDA. I am extremely pleased with this purchase but bear in mind, I have not owned other brands. Compared to similar offerings, the Motorola Q is much slimmer and lightweight. I was attracted to its functionality, its looks, and its potential to do what I needed done. The voice and sound qualities of the phone exceed my expectations as does the built in camera. I have not yet tried to use the music aspects but that was not important to me in my selection. The full QWERTY keyboard is easy to use compared to others in this class and the interface to the internet is very easy to manipulate. Its voice recognition component has been outstanding so far. The standard battery has been so functional to this point, that I have not even charged the extended battery. Since my corporate system is based on Windows, I needed a Windows Mobile software unit to sync with my corporate requirements. I was amazed with how quickly I was able to sync with my work units, how quick the interface is, and how accessible my emails and corporately based data is now available in my handset wherever I am in the US or world (mostly). All my contacts, my calendar, and all incoming emails appear in my handset within seconds of arriving at my office computer. I especially appreciate the ability to receive my Windows based email from work on my MOTO Q9h but also my email from accounts at AOL and Yahoo. One glance at the screen and I can see email waiting on my Outlook account, my AOL account, a text message, and any voicemails. I assume other smartphones can do this, but it is pretty slick, nonetheless. All in all, this is a great smartphone and I am extremely pleased with it. It is reassuring to know I have the equivalent of everything from an MP3 player to a camera to an internet portal to a video player--all that and a great phone too!

Very sleek, very useful, tons of features. The only really annoying trait of all of the Moto Razr phones is that the glass is horribly thin and flimsy, and is very easy to break (both inner and outer glass). Good luck finding replacement glass for it - and when you do, expect to pay $15 bucks for it. When you replace the glass, if you don't position it just right, it's easy to break again, because it will be possible to put too much pressure on it. It's not possible to remove it and reposition it, because the glue is so sticky and the glass so thin, that you'll break it just getting it off again. These days you can buy a flip phone with more features for $30 bucks. Yes, I still prefer flip phones. They call them ""throw back"" phones now.

I can create play lists in Windows Media Player on my desktop and when I connect the Treo using the USB cable my play lists are automatically synced to the storage card. I have two major complaints about this phone. First of all, it's like Windows 95 -- I have to ""reboot"" it every day -- and I don't have any extra software installed other than what comes with the phone. People will frequently tell me they called and got voice mail but my phone did not ring -- when I try to turn on the phone it won't turn on. I have to remove the battery cover and use the stylus to push the reset button. If it's going to lock up that much, at least they should make the reset button more easily accessible. Second, my favorite feature, the voice commands, frequently just doesn't work. When it does work it's incredible -- you push the button on the wired headset and say the right command and you can play music, call any one of your contacts, and I believe you can do other things I haven't tried yet. But 80% of the time you push the button and nothing happens. Very disappointing.",positive,low,

2025-08-15T07:18:35.315484Z,"I bought the Jawbone 2 when it came out because it was supposed to be the best headset out there. It wasn't. First of all, the headset would not stay in my ear no matter what, without an ear loop. I don't mind that so much but the ear loops that come with the headset are too short, so the headset has a habit of slipping until it points straight down or falls off. Eventually, I found sound Jabra ear pieces that fixed all my fit-problems and I had a pretty decent experience with the headset since (also, the styling matched my Switcheasy Serpent iPhone case exactly, which was cool). The NoiseAssassin is very effective (provided you don't have a beard... or a very thin beard at most). However, about 9 months in, audio coming out of the headset started sounding distorted and buzzy. It got worse and worse until I set it aside because I couldn't understand people any more, just using the clunky iPhone earbuds instead. Recently, I contacted Jawbone support to see if they had any ideas, explaining that I'd had it since it first came out. First, they had me perform a reset on the headset. When that didn't work, they said they'd replace it. I was actually pretty stoked since I didn't expect that sort of offer. So I gave them my information and faxed them a copy of my receipt (I ordered it directly from them, I should add). It took a week of email tag since they claimed they couldn't open any of the files I emailed to them (including PDF's and even a plain-text file), so I had to fax it from work (who uses faxes any more?). A week later, I get a call from them - saying that my warranty had expired a month prior and they wouldn't replace the headset. What? I was under the impression that they understood I'd had the thing forever (I mentioned it several times in my correspondence). I pointed that out as well as the fact that I wasn't aware the thing had a warranty at all and I was just happy they were going to replace it out of a commitment to good service. Guess not. Instead, I would up being lied to and having my time wasted. It's partially my fault for waiting so long to get a hold of them, but customer service people really shouldn't go making promises they have no intention of keeping. That's absolutely unacceptable. Since I have to buy a brand new headset now, I'm going to go with Logitech, whose products and customer service ALWAYS exceed my expectations. This was my last Jawbone.",negative,high,envío

I find it a bit awkward to insert my phone into the case, it usually takes me a bit to get it in there, especially if I am putting anything else in it (like money or keys). There are two small holes at the top for speakers which work well. The frustrating part about this case is that you are not able to use the phone through the plastic (at least I wasn't on my Droid) and taking your phone in and out of the case on a run is near impossible. Also, sometimes when I put my phone into the case it hits buttons and the volume goes way up or it turns the music off altogether. But that might just be my phone. My boyfriend borrowed the armband the other day and used it with his iPhone. He was somewhat able to use his phone through the plastic cover which was nice. But he had to put the armband on his forearm because it was too tight higher up. But it still worked for him well. The fabric is really nice and breathable. It dries quickly.

I've been using it for several months in a very noisy server room environment. Having gone through multiple supposedly ""noise canceling"" phones, this is the first one that really passed muster with customers. I had been using this on my standard phone line and integrated it with my laptop's Outlook directory. Simple, easy and excellent! Within 5 minutes I had 200 contacts loaded onto the phone. It's nice that you can manually edit the phone numbers and contact information before they're loaded onto the phone so you don't wind up with extraneous data. I just switched over to using VOIP instead of a phone line, and decided to use this with my Mac instead of Windows. Honestly, it's not so good. Unlike other phones that are specifically designed to be VOIP phones, you can't dial the phone through the handset anymore - you have to use the softphone. You can answer and disconnect calls, but that's all. The software for the Mac is not as mature as it is for the PC, either. The Calisto Pro utility for the Mac frequently loses connectivity to the Mac and doesn't show up in the utility bar that it's lost its connection. So, you'll be dialing away through the softphone only to hear your party answering - and you're not audible. It's not a very professional image to present if you're using this for work, as I do. So far, the software for Windows is more reliable. No matter which operating system - once you have a successful connection, sound quality is excellent. The earpiece is very comfortable and the device has wonderful range. I'd like to see Plantronics improve the quality, reliability and feature set of the VOIP offering for this device.

2025-08-15T07:18:35.753021Z,"Overall, I've been extremely satisfied with Motorola's H7XX series. I actually purchased the H710 and about the time the warranty was to expired I used it. On Motorola's mistake, they sent me a H715 instead. I didn't immediately notice though but little things were different. The black shade was a little different and then I noticed ""tones"". Tones when I would connect, disconnect, etc. that I did not have with the H710. I like both colors and they both go good with my original iPhone. I think amazon has the best price on both of these... I would highly recommend them. I am currently testing the Plantronics Voyager Pro and notice that it doesn't like my blackberry. It works fine with my original iPhone but the voice quality isn't as great as it was with the H7XX series. I'm returning it and requesting a replacement to see if it was just that one headset. I'm really rooting for the PRO. I find the H7XX series are easier to carry in the pocket as it folds nicely. The PRO feels great and the smallest ear rubber piece works great for my ears. I've had the headset on for hours and using the smallest ear rubber has worked the best. But enough of the Pro. Thank you for your time. UPDATE 01/09/2012 These Motorola H7XX series seem to have about a 10-16 month lifespan. And still I love them. I have used the Motorola warranty right before the 1 year limit and have received either a refurbished or a brand new one which again last about another year or so. So with that I will drop my overall rating to a 4 STAR.",positive,low,precio|calidad
2025-08-15T07:18:35.767005Z,"I purchased this product because the cell phone reception in my house is horrible. Before I bought the product I climbed on the roof and verified that I had three bars and good call clarity. I fist tried mounting the antenna the peak of the roof line with the base unit in the basement. Didn't seems to work too well. My coax ran within 4"" and perpendicular to a 110V power line, so I repositioned the coax to emlimante this interference with no improvement, sometimes I would get a little better signal but not really a usable signal. So I went out and bought an antenna mount with a 10 foot mast and mounted the antenna at the peak of the roof, I placed the base station in the basement on the floor. This is as much vertical seperation as I can legally have as I am limited in antenna height, this is at least 25 feet of vertical seperation. I still cannot figure out the blinking lights on the base unit after reading the manual several times as they all blink in various patterns pretty much constantly. I don't think there is anything else I can do to improve the installation per the instructions. Now sometimes I get pretty good reception standing by the base unit (3 bars) and about 2 bars on my main floor but other times the system does not appear to be functioning at all. The system seems to be really flakey in the fact that it works sometimes okay but other time not really at all. I have to say I am dissapointed because I spent allot of time trying to get the system installed correctly with poor results and the unit was very expensive without good results, I pretty much feel like I wasted $300.",negative,low,precio

2025-08-15T07:18:35.911181Z,"Screen is impossible to read in sunlight. Cannot see caller ID, missed messages etc. When keying in phone numbers that you are calling, numbers are large and legible but all else is horrible. Of course this is standard to all LCDs(read modern screens) verses older VGA(read much better resolution and contrast). I am about to relicense my older LG phone with VGA. Software menu's are much harder to use then older menu layout and software on previous LG's. The absolute worst defect(feature?) is when you receive a call, it is almost impossible to retrieve from your pocket without touching the call interruption button on the outside edge of the phone. This of course disconnects the call and with the crummy screen and you are outside, it is impossible to tell who was calling that you disconnected. This design flaw could be very easily corrected by several means that would take even a full blown idiot about 5 minutes to think up. Possibly requiring 2 rapidly hits to the disconnect button to cut off a call. There are other simple ideas to resolve this problem. This was a problem with my previous LG. You would think that these miscreants that design this stuff would use it in the real world before foisting there newest bright ideas on to the unsuspecting consumer. In other words to see what us chickens are eating out here. I do not like the way the square edge of the earpiece fits my ear. The more rounded oval type edges are far better for getting audio into the ear canal. As noted by others, the keyboard sucks. Would be nice if some commonly used keys were color coded so that in daylight when keys(they are flat and very reflective) are hard to see, they would be more user friendly. Do like the slimline of the phone and its high tech look. Only reason that I upgraded(?) phone was to gain bluetooth but am finding that my older phone was far more ergonomically user friendly.

There is also quite a ""delay lag"" when audio begins through the headset, which usually results in missing the initial part of calls/communications. Also, the range is less than ideal, I found it rather limited when I tested it and compared to other BT headsets on my phone. All of these are unfortunate, but not completely crippling, for the overall usability of the headset. I even tried contacting BlueAnt's technical support department, in case I had a bad unit, but only ever received an email confirming they got my original report of an issue...

I read lots of reviews on amazon and cnet and the Blue Ant Z9i is the only one that I came across with a 5 star rating. That was 2 weeks ago and I see it's now down to a 4 star rating. I have no complaints about the audio quality. I'm hearing impaired and wear hearing aids so I do need to take 1 of the hearing aids out to use the headset but I was still able to understand conversations crystal clear on the other end. I encountered some statis a few times but when I moved around a bit that seemed to disappear. I asked several people on the other end how my voice sounded and they all said it was fine. So no complaints about the audio. The fit however, is another story. Once the headset was in my ear for a few seconds with the ear hook on it was ok and I didn't really notice too much that it was in. But getting it into my ear wasn't a smooth process. Either I have very smell openings on my ears or the ear bud is on the large side. I did manage to get it in and for the most part it was comfortable enough that I wouldn't complain about it. But if I had to rate it on it's fit I would not give it 5 stars. the ear hook was an issue from day one. Because I wear hearing aids I switched back and forth each day between my left and right ears so that my hearing aid batteries drained evenly. The first time I switched the postion of the ear hook it came detached from the unit and although I was able to get it on well enough to stay on my ear, I knew it wasn't as secure as it could or should be. I was constantly checking to make sure it was still sitting on my ear properly. I think they could've done a much betterjob designing a sturdier ear hook. I'm also visually impaired and can't really see the display all that well so the only functions I used were turning the powere on + off, always checking to make sure the up volume button was as high as it goes, and pressing the MFB to use voice activation to dial calls. I can't comment on the other features such as call waitinig, muting, etc because I didn't use them. I just ordered a replacement bluetooth headset and went with the Motorola H700 this time. The ear hook seems to be better constructed and I think I'll like it better just touching my ear rather than jamming a too big earbud into my ear. My hearing aids that go into my ears are nowhere near as big as this headset. If the earhook and earbud aren't issues for you you'll like this headset just fine.",neutral,low,calidad

It's got the right dimensions, not too heavy in the shirt pocket, feels good in my hand, the keypad has excellent touch and layout with 1-press keys for Calendar, Contacts, Email, Bluetooth (on/off) and Silent/General mode. It's real cool that the 1-press keys for Calendar, Contacts and Email have different modes. Short press starts the app (Calendar, Contacts, Email). Long press starts a new record within the app (new calendar entry, new contact, new message). I've re-assigned the 1-press key for Email to start the Messaging app, and long press starts the CryptoGraf Messaging app to encrypt my messages. There's WLAN internet access with a proper browser. The camera, with just 2 MegaPixels, is good enough for my needs. The screen is crystal clear and good for viewing video and images. BTW, I thought it gets scratched quite easily, but that's just the plastic screen protector. I removed the screen protector and the screen stays scratch free even after I put the phone in my trouser pocket along with my keys. Another feature that makes the upgrade from E50 to this E51 a great idea...there's a font setting for adjusting the menu font sizes to Large, Medium, Small. Voice call quality is quite good. The speakers are also quite good but they're awkwardly located on the back. The volume controls on the side of the phone are not easy to use...it's quite confusing that the 'cursor key' acts as a volume control for the media player, but the voice call volume control is on the side of the phone.

Finally after several minutes they turn on, but will not pair with either mp3 player or my Helio Ocean phone. Tried calling Samsung support. What a joke. Got transferred six times to different 'departments'.

2025-08-15T07:18:36.428801Z,"I've had my T-Mobile Sidekick II (produced by Danger, Inc for Sharp) since December 2004. I got one because my pal Leo Laporte got one. We seem to trade tech fetish material back and forth, he convinced me to buy a Sidekick just by talking about it, I came on his show to pimp the Playstation Portable (more on that in another article). It's a fun little game we play. Now, let me preface this article by saying that I really really despise PDAs. I used to have a Palm III, IIIe, and IIIc back from 1999-2000. I may have hated them because I had no life to organize, but I came away from the PDA fad revolution thinking they were an utter waste of time. I still do today, and PDAs seem to be getting even more expensive by the day and don't do what a person needs them to. There are many types of cell phones that have tried this formula and failed, and many successful ones which are not as tactile as this phone (the Blackberry, Treo 600 and Treo 650 for instance). There are also insanely expensive phones like the Sony-Ericsson P900 which are basically just a Palm unit in a phone (aka a ""smart"" phone)... who the hell wants to use a stylus to pick a telephone call up? I'd like to meet `em. The Sidekick is a totally different beast. It's essentially a kinda-chunky cell phone combined with a few communication utilities that people actually use and a 640480 integrated digital camera. There is an AIM client built in, a Yahoo Messenger client that is downloadable free inside the unit, a semi-full-featured POP-compatible e-mail client, a web browser, and my killer app, the $10 downloadable SSH Terminal client. It also has a few things I don't use like a basic scheduler and to-do list. I can't say there's a feature other than the last two I listed that I don't use on this phone. It's a marvel of engineering and a phone that clearly was designed by geeks (the calculator app says `31337&#8242; on the application icon's display), but is also insanely user friendly and every button on the unit does what you'd think it would do in applications on the phone. The sidekick uses some form of java to serve up it's programs and is decently fast. Certainly not breaking any speed records but it does what it needs to do. The AOL Instant Messenger client gets a LOT of use by me, I always have this on when I'm walking around, and the implementation of this on the phone is insanely good. It's almost as tactile to use as AIM on a laptop and typing to others using the qwerty keyboard is so fast most of my friends do not even realize they're talking to me on it while I'm driving 70 miles per hour down the highway going somewhere. The second most used feature is definitely the Sidekick's built in 640480 camera. It is pretty terrible in low light situations (sometimes I have to hold the camera steady for up to 5 seconds to get it to ""adjust"" to the light so you can even see anything), however I still use it very often and having it nearby has become an almost invaluable resource for documenting strange things I see everywhere. Once the photo is taken the built in mail program on the sidekick can send it to any email address you can think of in seconds. I absolutely love this feature. The mail client on the Sidekick is very impressive. You can have up to 4 email addresses active, in addition to the provided @tmail.com address you get with the phone. The phone fully supports POP email as well and grabs new mail from T-Mobile's server in a sort of ""push"" fashion every 15 or 30 minutes (I am not sure on the exact interval). Pictures can be viewed and sent in email, and you can tell it to strip attachments of different types to save on phone memory, which comes in very handy since the unit only has 6MB of storage space to store mail in. I am not sure why they skimped in this department, but they made tools to keep it easy to manage the mail coming in, such as an auto-delete after X days feature to keep you below your 6MB memory limit. Contacts pop up based on the email address you filled into their phone book entry in your phone and it supports fuzzy searches of a few letters allowing you to scroll and quickly select the person you were looking for to add to the email list. The web browser on the sidekick leaves a little to be desired. It does not support JavaScript and has a bit of difficulty with frames, and with images turned on some sites don't load at all or load insanely slow. I turned images off on my sidekick to speed up browsing since I usually use it to find phone numbers or addresses anyway. It is fast enough now with the images turned off on the web browser but I hope by the time the Sidekick 3 rolls around there will be faster data networks in place and better software. One of the features that does not come on the Sidekick by default is the Terminal program. Useful only to real geeks and unix/linux nerds, this feature allows you to remotely control any unix based machine via a secure shell. I use this currently to SSH into a linux machine I have sitting at home that has irssi on it (a popular command line irc client) - so I can use IRC from the road. I take credit for discovering this feature myself and turning Leo on to it. Dan 1, Leo 0 :) . This is just a killer app for any nerd who wants to chat anywhere, anytime. Boring movie or dinner? Just whip this out and talk to people who aren't boring to you. Other than those three features, some neat features the Sidekick has are: - Reflective TFT screen: Even in broad sunlight the LCD is easy to read, an essential thing for using this outside. The sun reflects off the LCD making it even brighter than the built in backlight. - Flip up screen with qwerty keyboard / scroller: Both are a godsend. The scroll wheel is very intuitive also. - Picture Phone Book Entries: you can snap a photo of your friend and attach it to their phonebook entry, so every time they call you see their ugly face grinning at you. - Ability to view JPG, GIF, PDF and WAV files: Hallelujah! Picture format support is excellent for a device like this. You can also play WAV files... I've been told you can assign WAV files to ring tones but haven't bothered with it yet. - Games: Many many downloadable games for this including a version of Snake called Snake DX. The standard cell phone fare, not very good graphics but sorta fun. Here's my summary of this unit. Pros: + Excellent Mail, AIM, and Terminal programs + Excellent screen for the size + Insanely well designed user interface! Both hardware and software! + Flip-out hidden QWERTY keyboard is amazing. + Only has the stuff you need and nothing else + Nationwide AIM and IRC! I'm in heaven! Cons: - Battery only lasts about 1.5 days - Slightly bulky (didn't bother me much) - Web browser is slow with images turned on - Camera has poor low light performance - No bluetooth support - High price (around $300) if you don't buy it with a plan, but who cares! My final call: Buy this thing if you possibly can! It is $20/mo on top of your existing T-mobile plan for unlimited data, or $25/mo if you do not want phone service. People constantly stop me when I'm out and ask me about this thing. It is a head-turner, that's for sure. It's so good that I almost regret owning a laptop these days.",negative,low,precio

The other problem is again associated with outdoor installation. They give you ab. 30 feet of coaxial cable which is great. The problem is that BOTH ends are finished with the crimped attachment hardware....try getting THAT through the existing cable hole to the outside. So, another trip to the hardware store 17 miles one way to get a crimping tool and masonry bits and screws to PROPERLY attach the mounting hardware for the signal atenna on the OUTSIDE brick.

2025-08-15T07:18:36.574816Z,"After losing my last Plantronics 510 to a ""dog incident"", I picked up another 510, a Motorola H710 and a Jabra BT8040 and put them to the test head-to-head. I use a Uniden cordless land-line phone that can pair with a BT headset, and a Palm Centro smartphone. All three of these phones support multipoint. The H710 failed to cancel echo (my voice played back to me delayed) on the Uniden phone, and the BT8040 would not pair with the Uniden at all. All three worked well with the Centro. All three headsets had very good audio quality in quiet environments. The 510 was best in noisy and windy environments. The H710 had the loudest volume and was easiest to hear callers. The BT8040 in extremely loud environments would apparently get confused in its echo cancellation algorithms and tend to experience audio cutouts (for the wearer, not the caller). The H710 has the best ""user interface"". Love how flipping the little boom mike open and closed turns on and off the headset. It's audio prompts are intuitive and pleasant. The BT8040 and H710 both have good button/LED usage designs. The BT8040 requires a 3-5 second button press to turn the phone on and off -- otherwise it is the user interface equal to the H710. In comparison, the 510 has a less polished interface. The power button is hard to use, and it constantly flashes a blue light when on, which grabs the attention of those around you -- a feature that I find quite annoying. The interface of the BT8040 is just as good, with the exception that on and off requires a 3-5 second button press -- less elegant than the H710's approach. The 510 has a big flaw in its user interface: a blue light flashes all the time it is on. Combined with its large size, the 510 annoyingly draws the attention of those around you. Pocketability is a big concern for me. The 510 isn't really pocketable. I never broke one in 3 years, but then almost never put it in my pocket for fear of breaking it. The H710 when off is nearly a sphere and is easily pocketable. The BT8040 is a micro-sized ""brick"" in shape, smaller than the H710 and about equally pocketable. Headset fit is another bit concern. The 510 is the most comfortable for me. The BT8040 is second, which surprised me. The H710's hard ear-loop rubs on my ear in one spot and pretty quickly becomes uncomfortable. The 510 isn't amenable to glasses, but the other two are. All of the headsets are secure. The 510 fits well as a result of its design. The BT8040 fits well, in part because it is so very small and light. The H710 'hangs' and 'flaps' against the ear, is the least secure of all three, but didn't ever fall off when I was testing it. Battery life is good on all units. I don't talk enough to give them a hard workout in this regard. However, the 510 seems to take the longest to charge, the BT8040 the fastest, and the H710 in the middle. I found the H710 to be the worst of the three. It's performance in noisy conditions doesn't compare well to the others. It's fit is the worst, at least on my ear. The H710 is definitely the loudest of the three, which could be a boon for many headset wearers. Just don't plan on using it in very noisy situations.",positive,low,calidad

2025-08-15T07:18:36.610953Z,"I had this phone for two days before trading it in for a cheaper, sturdier phone. I was absolutely in love with the features but in the end the actual hardware convinced me to return it. The good: It comes with windows mobile 6, which includes windows explorer, word, excel and powerpoint (read and edit). It also has a sharp 2.0 megapixel camera and a decent video recorder. My favorite feature was the touch screen which responded well to my fingers as well as the included stylus. It has handwriting recognition and virtual keyboard for input. You can press the talk button to bring up a virtual keypad, and in general I found it quite easy to make phone calls. I only used the wifi card with the internet and found it to be pretty fast, although browsing the web tends to drain the battery. Even so, you can get a good two days use out of it if you remember to turn the wireless card off when not using it, otherwise it'll constantly be searching the area and will empty the battery in hours. Also, as others have said, the phone has a very nice soft rubbery feel to it. It's also a very pretty phone with rich colors. The bad: I almost never used the slide out keyboard because it's very flat and has a slippery plastic feel. Also there was a delay when you slid it out when the phone tries to reorient itself. In general the phone is a little slow, due to its 201 MHz processor, and you'll have to constantly close out programs in order to keep in running smoothly. When the keyboard is closed, it doesn't lock in, so that it's always wiggling around. This is especially annoying when you're on the phone for a while. It also comes with very little memory. With all the programs, you won't have enough room in the internal memory for even one song, so purchasing extra memory is a must. The phone is also quite bulky and fragile, so you'll be paranoid about dropping it. In the end I was sad to return it because it's got some really amazing features, but I just couldn't justify the price with all the flaws.",negative,low,precio
2025-08-15T07:18:36.619531Z,"Well I just got this phone the other day and heres my immediate thoughts. Great price for the package (color screen, flip, camera, free headset, very useable belt clip). To go into detail, the color screen is good but not great. A friend of mine has the Sanyo 4900 and the color screen on that looks clearer during less light conditions but not as nice in highly lighted conditions. The headset works fine. The reception is 3 bars upstairs in my house and 2 bars downstairs. Call quality is better than the previous phones I have owned (old sprint one, and motorola startac). Changeable faceplates gives the phone a customizable touch. Ring tones sound a bit fuzzy with the phone open it seems but when shut sound fine. A very odd variety of ring tones as well. To sum up: Pros: Customizable Clear Quality of Calls Variety of Ring Tones Belt Clip Voice Dialing Cons: Color screen in darker settings Lack of variety of actual background pictures.

The user-interface on the headset (buttons, LED, ear buds, etc.) work well for such a small form factor, even with big hands/fingers.

The outbound audio is tinny and sometimes distorted. The earpieces designed to rest in the ear canal have been designed with too much tolerance in their interface with the base unit so when you twist them on, they easily fall off. This makes putting the device on your ear an extreme challenge. I finally had to use a small amount of adhesive to bond the earpiece to the device so it would not fall off every time I put in on my ear. This is a classic example of functional design coming up way short of very good aesthetic design. Don't bother buying this until they fix it.",positive,low,calidad
2025-08-15T07:49:39.248810Z,"This is possibly the best bluetooth I have ever owned. It can function as a standalone headset while still playing wireless audio or you can add the attachment for wireless stereo music. It comes with multiple ear attachments to fit different exterior ear shapes and interior ear sizes. Very durable which is what really amazes me. I inadvertantly dropped this thing in the middle of a snow storm at my home and thought, ""Oh, crap. I just lost $80."" I waited a moth later and I found the head set after the snow melted. I charged it, used it, and it worked just like new! I was amazed at this little things hardiness considering it also takes daily beatings from my 1 and 3 year old. The sound quality is excellent and does not receive much interfernce like others I have used. If my bluetooth music skips it usually isbecause the cellular radio on my phone is on which interfers on most any cell phone, so if it is off it plays flawlessly. It works well at a distance up to the advertised 30 feet and syncs nicely to my PC. It has the AD2P functionality with I believe 2.1 BT firmware. It stays nicely in your ear so you can hear your audience well and does not move much if fitted properly to your ear, even when running though I would not recommend it for jogging. I wish this used a normal USB mini charger but if that is the only fault that is pretty good. As for the buttons and media functions like voice dialing and pause/play/next the headset works very well although not as well on Android phones. By this I mean that sometime you need it hit buttons twice to make it work and sometimes the audio does not pick up on command but call quality and music quality are very good. Windows Mobile phones work flawlessly with it as I'm sure Blackberrys and other smart phone would. I will note the first one I got (which I admit was used) worked terribly after a month, but you pay for what you get which is especially true with bluetooth headsets. I have seen others go as high as $200 and yet this one works well for an average pricing. I have bought headsets for $10, $30, $80, and $200 and more often than not the more you pay for it the better it works. Happy listening.

2025-08-15T07:49:39.295931Z,"UPDATED Feb 9th 2008: Well the BT5020 is now dead, I'm sending it back to jabra and we will see from there what happens. Following my initial review I returned the unit for replacement once and that fixed some of the sound issues, not all of them but enough that I was acceptably pleased. Over the 6 months I found the unit to be functional and seldom did it offer me reason to complain, the sound was clear and I could be heard without many ever offering complaint, unless I was outdoors in a wind, but I think some aspects are to be understood and tolerated. I will note though, using the dual connection capability was nice, but glitchy, especially when hooked to a nextel and using direct connect, then things truly got fouled up and generally connections were lost to the phones and often calls. Over all I won't lower or raise my review on this unit, it worked when it worked and while far from stellar, I think for 30 bucks it was acceptable. ________________________________________________________________ I'm new to the BT ear piece market, this being my second in the past few months. My first was/is the Jabra BT500, which is very enjoyed... once I got used to tolerating the eargel discomfort, and no adjustability for fit. So my hopes were high with the BT5020, in getting rid of the eargels and allowing for some angle and length of speaker position, would fix my comfort levels. So my first impressions of the BT5020 was wow, this is comfortable, it weighs less, no eargel and the size is very balanced with the over all package. Turned on the power and it started in pair mode, and paired without a glitch or bump with my Sanyo 8400. So far so good, I was working in the yard, so decided to leave it on and see how I liked the fit and feel. And to speak straight, I forgot I had it on and got the sudden reminder of it real quick when my wife called, the vibrate alert went off (I'd forgotten it had vibrate alert) and I nearly came unglued tell I recalled what was doing it. This thing is that comfortable, no feeling like my ear is plugged up, no strange pulling or pushing, or slippage to keep telling me I have something on/in my ear. The phone call however set off the first warning signs, there was very distinct static and crackling, this with my phone on my hip on the same side as the earpiece. I kept it in mind but kept working for a few hours before deciding to go and really play with my new earpiece. I started conducting some tests around the house, called customer service of my phone company, and figured to kill two birds with one stone. I had the phone on a shelf at the same level as my ear, about 3 feet away. The static wasn't noticed this time so I began moving around the room and it returned. After 9-12 feet distance, the static was so bothersome that if the CSR had answered, I'd not have been able to conduct business. I tried moving it closer and at different angles with varying results and little improvement. Static wasn't noticed as a background noise or white noise type, but direct distortion of voice and or background music (I was on hold a while), it changed with the volume/beat of the sound I was supposed to be hearing clearly. To say the least, right now I'm not pleased; I truly like the feel, fit, weight and appearance of this headset. There is a notable creak from the flexible portion but nothing I will notice after a few days of using something. The button position for those used to the BT500, as I am, is a little different as it is a bit harder to tap the answer/end button, for you can't really just pinch the end of the mic area and catch the button, as you can with the BT500, but those are small things and a few days of playing will pan out if they become larger issues. I've worn wired headsets for years, mostly Plantronic or Jabra versions'; so moving to BT has been a learning experience. I'm not going to give up on the BT5020 just yet, I'm going to further test it over the weekend, at work where I'll have multiple other phones and radios on or around my person, at times talking on various radios of various frequencies. I think this will truly tell me if the BT5020 can hold mustard, or if it gets packed up on Monday and sent back, something I'm usually ill tolerant of doing unless something is truly truly broken and/or a turd.",negative,high,calidad

This may cause issues if you keep calling the same number or can't figure out why the voice command feature isn't coming up because you weren't paying attention to the length of time you pressed the call button.

2025-08-15T07:49:39.355343Z,"I should start by saying this is my first Bluetooth device, so I was pleased at how easily this paired to my phone (Samsung Galaxy S -- another reviewer complained that Samsung didn't allow third-party device pairing, which obviously is no longer true) following the instruction manual (whose usefulness sadly sort of ends there). I should also say I didn't pay full retail but rather bought through a Hong Kong eBay seller -- waited an eternity for shipping but got a real bargain, especially considering the device is far from perfect and not exactly worth full price. First and foremost, battery life. The description promises 8 hours? After two full charging cycles, I'm lucky to squeeze 3-1/2 to 4 out of it. Maybe that will improve over time, but doubling? I'm skeptical. Of course, it seems to give another hour or more of use after the low battery starts alarming, the problem is that's with an audible chime every 30 seconds or so that interrupts your music and is impossible to ignore. There's nothing in the manual about disabling this so I doubt it's possible. Second, the play/pause and rewind buttons are a bit hit-or-miss. Not a dealbreaker, but I would have felt a little shafted if I had paid full retail. I was a tad disappointed in the range. I had hoped to use this while working nights at a vet hospital, but concrete walls proved too great an obstacle. Works well with the phone in the room with me though. Those are my only complaints really. The volume is great, even a little too loud at times. The hands-free works well and my callers say I sound fine. I like keeping this tucked under my shirt while biking and eliminating the obtrusive headphone wire extending all the way to my handlebars, and I can correctly hit the buttons through my shirt about 90% of the time thanks to the ridged edges. I especially love that I set this up with my Tasker app so just connecting the BT automatically launches my bike computer app, turns on GPS, maximizes my screen brightness and media volume, and disables screen timeout*. In short, a cool little toy but don't settle for full retail price. 2-week update: It seems like the battery life is getting worse rather than better. Occasionally will get a ""bum connection"" where music stutters or puts weird choppy cuts in that screw up the beat, fixed by unpairing and re-pairing. With these shortcomings, I think they really have some stones asking such a high retail price for this thing. *This might be more of an endorsement for Tasker.",positive,low,precio|envío

Problem is, if you take advantage of all the iPhone features (especially video streaming, or heavy photography) you can run through electrons pretty quickly. I previously used a Battery Case extender which is manufactured by a popular company, and really had no problems with it. The big ""but"" is, I'm an active guy; gym, running, and hiking. Most of the battery style cases don't offer much in the way of protection from moisture either from sweat, or the unanticipated rain shower while outside. I obtained an Otterbox Defender case, which I have found provides the best all around protection from both drops, scratches, and also moisture. Moving the phone between the two became a huge hassle just to get the phone charged up, and also I lost moisture protection when using the battery case. Enter the New Trent IMP500, which I found on Amazon.com and was intrigued by the large capacity given its' size. I purchased one, and also a Griffin coiled USB to 30pin Apple sync cable. I carry the IMP500 and coiled cord in a discreet runner's belt under my shirt which keeps it close at hand without committing the dreaded Fanny Pack fashion faux pas. The IMP500 comes with an retractable USB charging cable, with mini-USB and micro-USB adapters. This cable can be used both for charging the unit, or in reverse for powering any device utilizing a micro or mini-USB port (virtually all non-Apple wireless phones). I can plug in my Bluetooth headset when the unit isn't needed to power my iPhone. The construction seems sturdy, and the corners are rounded so that it can be carried close to the body, or in a pocket without generating discomfort. It features an on/off switch, and also a row of LEDs to indicate the unit's state of charge. At 5000mAh rating, it should provide several recharges to the iPhone without needed juice itself. I now have no hesitation at going on an overnight hike, and even using the iPhone GPS unit for navigation as I know I have a couple recharges left.

Sure, any writer is proud to be asked for his take, but how could I adequately review a regulatory cost recovery fee? I mean, nobody likes to pay fees. But this fee in particular is perhaps not as bad as the rest. You see, I'm one of those rare people who thinks regulations are a good idea. Especially utility regulations. Anyone who lived in California while Enron was bleeding electrical customers dry probably agrees that regulation is ultimately best. And this is the weird problem with cell phones: generally you aren't charged for long distance, hence the taxes usually charged for long distance can't be charged. The government was forced to put a fee on cell phone service. Now I know many of you are against taxes; I don't like paying taxes either. But ultimately, taxes and fees pay for a lot of things we take for granted, like utility regulations that keep our phone companies from bleeding us dry (for now). Frankly, I wish that most taxes and fees (especially payroll taxes) in favor of a steep progressive income tax that primarily taxed the wealthy, along with an estate tax that forced every American to start on a level playing field. Now THAT would be equal opportunity. But under our current tax system, this fee isn't so bad. Three stars out of five seems about right, although I hope the government starts regulating these insane text message rip-offs soon.

2025-08-15T07:49:40.170567Z,"This product is a mixed success in comfort. The band is comfortable on your neck, but the ear occluding earpieces are not as comfortable. As normal, the Motorola brand Bluetooth link works very well and the battery life is good. However, there are 2 problems - the earpieces suffer from the ""occlusion effect"", and 2 the stiff wires have bad touch noise. The ""occlusion effect"" is how your own voice sounds in your ears when you stick your fingers in your ear - you hear your own voice loudly, hear yourself swallow, and can even hear yourself breathe. The occlusion effect is undesirable in quiet environments and particularly if you are eating chips! Additionally, having the ear canal occluded makes the earpieces VERY sensitive to touch noise - touching the earpiece or when the stiff wire brushes against your collar produces a medium loudness scratchy noise in your ear. I understand why an occluded earpiece was used - because it can deliver great bass with extremely low power from the internal audio amplifier - but the occluded earpiece is annoying for long duration wear compared to buds that just sit in the bowl of your ear. It is possible to reduce the occlusion effect partly at the expense of bass and sound isolation by putting a hole the size of a pencil tip in the rubber earseal to allow it to vent to the outside.

It can be so sensitive, but yet not sensitive enough for the cancel button (sensor pad) to work. I would be typing a text message and before I could even finish one sentence, it would automatically send. Sometimes, it would scroll down the menus non stop until I just closed it. It would also freeze while I would do something, so I would have to close the phone and open it up again. The music player was great. You really need a memory card to get the total use of this ""MP3 player/cellphone"" I get my new phone in the mail today and one of the screws on the back of the phone (where the battery goes) was missing.

Also, the pictures I have saved on my card do not cover the entire wallpaper like on my old phone. I do not understand this. If you have a lot of money to spend, I guess this is a good phone for you.

2025-08-15T07:49:41.144699Z,The Motorola HT820 Bluetooth Stereo Headset works exactly as it is promoted. It has ease of use and is very durable. I use it mostly while working out for 90 minutes 4-6 days a week and after 3 months of hard use has held up very well. Pros: Ease of operation. A single charge can last up to 12 hours. Music clarity is very good. Using the headset with a cell phone along with music is excellent. Microphone picks up your voice and silences the backround noises very well. Cons: The volume is not as loud as I would normally like it when using it with an MP3 player. That is why I did not give it a 5/5 rating. I would recommend this headset to anyone.,positive,low,

2025-08-15T07:49:41.248693Z,"Just a quick experience on this earpiece and a personal view of the company. I've owned several over the past 3 years and have been very happy with them until today. As I plugged in my earpiece to charge via the company supplied USB cable connected to my computer, I walked away and started to notice a burning smell. As I looked around to find the source, I saw smoke coming from my earpiece. The connection from the earpiece to the charging cable had melted. I unplugged the cable from my computer and moved the earpiece into the garage in case the battery was on fire and could explode. I then called Jawbone to let them know of the situation and if there was a service department that I could send the earpiece to for trouble shooting. The person on the other end of the phone told me that the charger was not meant to be used with a computer, really? 1: The user manual states: You can charge your Jawbone headset via the wall charger, or via USB on your computer. It shows a couple pics, one of the wall plug and one of the computer with nice little arrows pointing where you can plug it in. I know the spiel, give the company memo so as to lay blame on the consumer, great motto, profit over people. Works on the uneducated and those who are ignorant enough to believe you have their best interests in mind. I then explained I wasn't looking for a replacement as it's a few years old, I just wanted to send it in so they could identify the problem, nope, not something they deal with. So long story short, Jawbone won't correct problems in their products. The fire could have been caused by faulty connections in either the headset or charger, bad soldering, cheap wiring, but hey, why would they want to know that? Maybe because these could be components still in use by your company and you might, you know, want to fix something that can cost someone their home or their life? Jawbone makes a great product, no doubt, but without a hint of integrity and a profit over people corporate attitude, I won't be buying their products ever again.",negative,low,

2025-08-15T07:49:41.264359Z,"My Nuvi 200 survived the initial 1-year warranty. A few months later, the power started shorting out. Evidently, the minor torque created by the cord is enough to break the internal connection between the power cord and the battery. I opened the little bugger up and noticed that the only connection to the battery is through a small, metal cage which sits upon the charger. This is connected to the main body on one side and not very well. The single point of connection had been severed due to the simple swing of the power cord! I don't recommend this product. If you are looking for a GPS, please consider one of the products that has a much stronger power connection. While this one should last the warranty, it will likely break soon after with limited usage. The Garmin website allows people to ship an ensured package back to the dealer (shipping roughly $10-20) and have it repaired for $50. Not worth it in my opinion.

So the price was okay and the size is nice and compact but unless the thing sits in your ear properly or you can find other ear buds to help fit it properly the volume for me is quite low (yes even when I'm not at the airport) and I find myself holding the Cardo with my index finger into my ear. Even while driving the headset fitment is poor enough to cause me to have to switch to a corded headset or to again push the cardo into my ear to hear well enough. Geeze I just cringe at the thought of spending over a $100 for the Aliph(?) and just hope thast it's better.",negative,low,precio

I then moved on to the Moto H710 which I found almost a prefect product of your ear was 1/2 sized.

I thought it was the best looking one of the phones they offer, because I like phones small and thin and I also like them to have a good quality camera. They offer some phones with just a VGA quality camera but this one has a 1.3 megapixels camera. I'll keep this review short and just list the good and bad points about the phone. GOOD: * small * thin * you can watch cable TV channels, some LIVE, and some included free with the pictures pack. I watch CNN, FOX News, E!, etc. You can even watch The Disney Channel live and use video on demand to choose a certain episode of the show to watch from a list of episodes. This is a good feature for long car trips or bus trips if you get bored. BAD: * It is hard to hang up. You have to hit the end button 2 or 3 times to disconnect. * When watching TV you better have headphones because the sound is loud and if you hit the down button it goes mute. I had to cover the speaker on the back with my thumb just so I could hear without it blasting thru my whole office. * If you want to use headphones good luck because there is no headphone jack. You have to buy a separate mini-USB to headphone jack adapter. And you'll need one kind if you want to listen to TV or music (the stereo kind) and one kind if you want to use a phone headset (the mono kind). * They put the volume, camera, and ""action"" button on the flip part of the phone, so when you go to flip open the phone you hit these buttons with your fingers. I've accidentally disconnected people before just trying to get the phone open. On the left side of the phone you have just one inch of free space to open the phone. So you have to be very careful opening it so you don't hit any of these buttons. * No address book searching as another reviewer mentioned. You can filter by ""friends"", ""family"", etc. but theres no search feature. Happy scrolling! * Very hard to get to the mini SD card. * Front screen is black when not in use so you can't see the time unless you press a button or open the phone.

The inside and outside screens and the metallic keypad get oily fingerprints after every use (is it just my skin?!) Looks yucky and kinda destroys all the aesthetics.

The problem is that the Treo 600 is the most fragile phone I've ever encountered. A drop from even 12"" will break the display, which isn't replacable or covered by the warantee. Your only solution: buy a new phone. Sprint are amazingly unhelpful here. They are more than happy to sell you a new replacement phone to fulfill your contract ($600), but that's it. If you press them, Sprint will sell you a ""cheap"" phone to continue your contract for only $150, but they will not repair a Treo 600. Moving on to coverage, I found that in the San Jose area, Sprint had lousy coverage. When pressed, Sprint will insist that there are new towers coming on line every day, but over the course of a year I only saw the signal strength get worse. If you must buy the Sprint version of the Treo 600, BUY THE INSURANCE. Over the course of a two-year contract, you will replace the phone at least once. Ask youself this: would you rather pay $5 a month for insurance, $600 to replace a broken phone, or $150 to buy out your contract and start over with a new carrier? Bottom line: the Treo 600 is a great phone if you're willing to treat it like it's made of glass. When it breaks, you'll have to deal with Sprint's abysmal customer service. If Palm can solve their manufacturing problems, they'll have a winner. Until then, but the insurance and the best protective case you can find.",negative,high,precio|calidad

2025-08-15T07:49:42.380249Z,"A lot of people are complaining about this headset. I share some of their views, but this is still a good headset. Sadly, I may have to stop using it and search for another. I have had a few bluetooth headsets in the past, and have had trouble hearing with all of them. I would love to use a headset like the Motorola H700 (my wife uses that one and loves it). BUT, those headsets are not very adjustable. I have large ears--and when wearing headsets like the H700, the speaker is a good 1/2"" or more AWAY from the opening to my ear canal... The result is I cannot hear a phone conversation, even at max volume, when there is ambient noise. I drive a 1999 Jeep Grand Cherokee, which is a rather loud ride at 70mph, and I just can't hear well... Now with the Jawbone, I could hear. Some complain that the headset is painful. I have experienced this myself. HOWEVER--if you take some time to carefully bend and adjust the metal ear-hook, you will find that the jawbone is both comfy and will sit quite well on your head. The speaker is near my ear, so I can hear well. Now the bad-the durability of both the hook and the earpiece are awful. The unit ships with a 6 or 8 hooks (I forget--its 3 or 4 for each left or right ear). I have already broken 2 of them. Once I break this one, which I am sure I will, I will have to pony up another $10 to buy another set of hooks. I like to keep the headset in my pocket--and in doing so the hook will bend over time. That means I may have to bend it back to re-adjust the hook to fit my ear well. Bend a piece of metal enough and it will snap. The only way to stop this would be to wear the headset constantly or keep the headset in some other pocket away from any potential forces... The other piece of crappy hardware is the earbud. None of the earbuds were that great a fit for me, but I picked the best one I could find. The earbuds have a rubber portion (that touches your ear). The other side is a hard plastic connector--you place the earbud on the jawbone, and turn 90 degrees to attach it. This mechanism doesn't work. When placing the jawbone on your ear, you will often rub the earbud to your ear, which sometimes turns the earbud. Turn it 90 degrees, and it will fall off. As time goes, this attachment mechanism will wear down, making the earbud move around with even less force, meaning it will fall off constantly.... I just ordered the Jabra EarGels, hoping that they will be much better earbuds, and maybe secure enough to use without the hook. Who knows. As it is, I like the headset when the hook and earbud aren't BROKEN. But, I refuse to spend $10 for new hooks, and $10 for new earbuds each time they break... I want a headset that can be stored in blue-jean pockets without being destroyed!! Maybe the next version will eliminate these issues!",negative,high,precio|calidad

2025-08-15T07:49:42.425742Z,"The short version: rubbish! Way too quiet (especially in-call audio), poor audio quality (obnoxious noise on output) and worse outgoing speech quality. The longer version: Let me start by saying that the premise of the Kensington LiquidAUX Bluetooth car kit is a great one. You can stream music via Bluetooth's A2DP profile to your car stereo's aux connection, and the car kit will also route calls to your stereo, handling muting of music automatically. If only it worked as well as its premise. This was tested in my wife's Scion xB (an '06 - the smaller original version) with the factory head unit (a Scion-badged Pioneer) and an iPhone 3GS. My first impression upon connecting this up in my wife's car was that this would be a cool little car kit - installation and pairing was simple. However, that impression died as soon as I tried to start running audio through it. First of all, the audio from the car kit is way too quiet when playing music. On my wife's head unit, a volume setting of about 15 is reasonable for the radio at any speed, and 20 starts to get obnoxiously loud. CDs tend to be a little quieter on this system, but 20 or so is a reasonable volume for those. To reach a similar music volume from this car kit, this stereo has to be turned up to 40 or so. Worse, the call audio is even quieter, if that's possible. To make a call even vaguely audible, the stereo's volume has to be pushed up north of 50. Even then, it's still way too quiet. This is unforgivable as this is intended to be a completely hands-free kit. In order to hear a call, you have to reach for the stereo to turn the volume up at the start of the call, then you have to scramble to turn it way down again to avoid having your head taken off when the call ends and the music starts again. This is an enormous distraction for a device that's supposed to reduce the driver's workload. This isn't a function of this stereo's Aux input, either. We've run an iPod shuffle to the aux input for over a year now without having to crank the volume up beyond what's needed for a CD. I also tested the iPhone from its headphone output, and that was reasonable, too. I'm not really a fan of doing that, though - you usually have to turn the headphone volume way up to get the signal anywhere close to a standard line output, and that more or less guarantees that you'll forget to lower the volume afterwards and will subsequently have your head taken off the next time you plug your headphones in. Anyway, I digress. It's all a bit academic, however, as even if you can hear the person on the other end of the line, there's almost no chance whatsoever that they can hear you. Since the microphone is part of the body that plugs into the cigarette lighter, it's likely a decent distance away from the driver, and all the noise cancellation in the world isn't going to help that tiny little mic pick up anything. This might be a side-effect of the raised seating position in the xB, but that's hardly uncommon with the number of SUVs and minivans on the road. A much better idea would have been a remote mic that you could stick somewhere on the dash, but perhaps Kensington was afraid of liability having extra cords running about the place. If that wasn't bad enough, there's another major problem with audio quality. There simply isn't enough filtering between the input power and the output audio, and the inherently noisy power source leaks through to your stereo. This might not be so bad if there was a ton of signal to swamp it and make it unnoticeable, but because everything's so quiet, signal/noise is abysmal. On my wife's car, I can hear a higher-pitch whine that varies directly with engine speed (this is probably straight from the alternator, but who knows?) plus a bunch of periodic clicks that also vary with rpm. This is plain annoying when playing music, but is cranked up to irritating and beyond during a call - remember, with the stereo turned way up to compenstate for the quiet calls, all that noise just gets louder. Unfortuately, I made the mistake of initially testing the car kit on battery power only before turning it over to my wife, so all I really noticed was the quiet audio. Let me put it this way: my two year-old was asking what all the funny noise was in the car. That's not a good sign, Kensington. Another ominous sign is that I'm not going to even bother rating the quality of the audio delivered over A2DP. Does it sound badly compressed? Who cares? I reached the limit of my patience with the car kit's other audible flaws long before I even started caring about how A2DP sounds. Oops. Another good premise is the little remote that comes with the system. However, this is a waste of time with the iPhone 3GS. The play/pause button does what you'd expect on the iPod side of the phone, and the call button will answer an incoming call when phone rings and will end the a call in progress. However, unlike many Bluetooth devices, the call button has no other function on the iPhone. Additionally, because the call audio is so quiet, I've hung up on a lot of people because I didn't hear anything, so I hit the call button again. Maybe that's for the best as it means I don't have to go through the whole ""Hello?...(hello?)...Hello?...(hello?)"" routine that this car kit seems to induce. A lot of headsets allow you to use voice dialling, etc. if you press and hold the call button. Not so with the iPhone - even though voice control was added in the most recent version of the OS (3.0), this button has no effect on the iPhone when no call is in progress. That's a huge pity, as voice control actually works fairly well. Additionally, the forward/back buttons have no effect on an iPhone. Where the blame for this lies, I'm not sure. I've seen suggestions that although Apple added A2DP to the iPhone, they didn't bother with AVRCP (A/V remote control profile). This would seem to make sense, and unfortunately makes the remote somewhat pointless. I'm also not convinced that the steering wheel is a good place for the remote. Personally, I wouldn't mind mounting it on the stalk for the wipers, but the rubber doohickey that the remote mounts in is obviously sized for a steering wheel and can't be secured to a stalk. I could take the remote out of its mount and stick it somewhere on the dash, but frankly, given this device doesn't actually have a future in my wife's car, I'm not going to bother. As far as I'm concerned, this was money flushed straight down the drain. Thankfully, I'm still within Amazon's return period, so I can offload it that way. Otherwise, I would just have to eat the cost, as I can't in good faith pawn it off on someone through eBay or whatever. It really is just that bad. Either way, it's going to get ripped out of my wife's car. This is the first doodad I think we've ever had that's basically scored a zero on the Wife Acceptance Factor scale, which is impressive, albeit for all the wrong reasons. Ugh.",negative,low,calidad

2025-08-15T07:49:42.548599Z,"I have now purchased four of these for everyone in my family. I have two installed in Europe and two installed here in the USA. The basic functionality is that it lets you use your home phone to talk on skype. When you get a skype call, your home phone rings. It works simultaneously with a land line as well. You can have skype and your land line connected at the same time. When you get a skype call your phone will ring differently than when a landline call comes in. It also acts like call waiting. If you're on a skype call and you get a regular call, you'll hear beeps just like call waiting and can flip between the two calls. It works with answering machines too. Incoming calls will ring the same number of times as your landline calls and your answering machine will pick up and they can leave a message just like a regular call. The advanced features are amazing. You can setup the Call Center for skype call forwarding. I have mine set to ring 4 times and if I don't pick up at home, it will use my landline to call my cellphone and connect the skype call. I no longer worry about being at home to take a skype call. The next cool feature is using the Call Center to allow you to make skype calls from any phone on the planet. With this feature enabled, the Call Center will answer your landline phone after a certain number of rings. It can make your PC act like an answering machine. When the greeting comes on, you can type in a secret pin code on the phone and it will then let you dial a skype call and connect you. Picture this: you're at work and have urgent news for your family in another country. Instead of making an international call or going home to make the call, you dial your home phone. The Call Center answering machine on your PC picks up. You punch in your pin and dial your skype speed dial number for your family and the call center connects you. You are now making an international phone call even though you're only paying for the call to your house. When you receive skype calls at home, the skype ID of the person calling will show up on your home phone caller ID. Setup is simple. 1) Install Skype and set it up on your pc 2) Install the software on the CD that came with the Call Center 3) Setup advanced Call Center features on your pc if you want to (it's optional). 4) Connect the Call Center USB cable to your computer 5) Connect your home phone to the Call Center 6) (optional) Connect your landline phone wire to the call Center That's it. You're now in business. Using this box has really improved my life! My parents in europe are not computer savvy and would have NEVER used skype regularly as it is complicated and confusing to them. Now if they want to talk to me, they just pick up the phone and dial ##1. If I want to call them, their phone rings just like normal. Also, I am using a Cable Modem phone line (voice over IP) from my cable company and the Call Center works just great. I read some places saying it may not work well, but it does.",positive,low,

As to the primary functionality, I haven't had problems with calls at all. Navigation is pretty simple. It's sturdy and I like the button for opening it. If you just want a phone to work as a phone, this one isn't too bad. The camera on this phone is essentially useless. The quality is so bad that you're likely not to bother using it. I tried using it for fun for a while, but found that nothing came out well so just stopped. I loved having the radio on the phone for my walk to the subway. I could catch up on some news. But then the phone stopped recognizing that the ear piece was plugged in. I got a replacement phone, but the same thing happened to the replacement after a month or so. To have a picture ID a person, you need to have the person's info locally on the phone, not on the card. Phone numbers when added are defaulted locally, which was a problem when I switched phones and had to move all my contacts to the card. While this seems to be typical, games are pointless.

I had to stay within 6' of the indoor antenna, but that was OK. Unfortunately, I had to turn in my company-owned phone (I retired) and replaced it with the LG Cosmos (still Verizon). Although it showed 3-4 bars, it would not send or receive calls and text messages. Thinking it was a flaw with the phone, Verizon replaced the LG Cosmos. Same problem. Once or twice I was able to make a call. I will say that tech support at Wilson Electronics was extremely helpful but they were at a loss as to why the DT Signal Booster wouldn't work with the LG phone but did with the Droid. I finally bought a network extender from Verizon which works through my internet connection. After rebate, it's $100. It works great and gives me coverage throughout the house and the yard.

2025-08-15T07:49:42.721196Z,"I got this phone based on a recommendation from AT&T :( silly me. I wanted a back up phone my wife could use in case her other phone failed to turn on (also a motorola different model almost 5x price). They recommend this phone because of it's low cost and it's a go phone so you only pay for minutes you use. I bought the phone and loved it. It was very low cost, came with airtime. It feels very solid, except for the battery cover which seems flimsy but seems to hold up with no problems. It had what I felt as good sound quality and a good number of features for such a low cost phone. I wanted to prep the battery since my wife was going to travel soon, so I left it powered on and would constantly press a button so the light would stay on and drain the battery. The display is amazingly bright, I could almost use it as a flashlight. I was also really surprised at the battery life. Anyhow after two cycles of draining the battery and then charging it to full, I figured it would be all set to use as an emergency phone for my wife who was going on a two week business trip. Wrong :( on the last day of her trip her main cell phone battery was low so she decided to try to use the back up phone. It wouldn't turn on :( I don't know if it was due to the xray machines at the airports or what but the battery was drained. She said she never turned it on at all until that day so maybe it got turned on accidently in her purse (phone turns on by pressing a button on the front for 4 or 5 seconds). Anyhow to make matters worse the AT&T rep also said I could also use it as a main phone by transfering the SIM. Nope didn't work either, I was on the older AT&T plan so I had to be migrated. Atleast the phone didn't cost too much. I figure I can still keep it as an emergency 911 phone too (Go phone minutes expire :( which the AT&T rep didn't tell me about).

2025-08-15T07:49:42.806041Z,"I've had Nokia, Sony-Ericsson, and Motorola phones - and each has had features that I found to be incredibly useful. I've heard a lot about Samsung phones in the international community and I was excited when I saw that T-Mobile began offering this phone. I was hoping it would be a combination of all that I ever wanted in a phone - but I was disappointed. To begin with, this phone looks great. Well-built, sturdy, and with a high-gloss finish that screams class it received many compliments every time I brought it out. The screen is bright and delivers detailed images and video. By far, this is the nicest screen I've seen on any portable product - including the iPod Video. It slides open and closes smoothly, and the keypad it reveals is backlit and easy to see in the dark. As an MP3 player, it delivers crisper sound than I heard from my Nokia 6600. The Bluetooth worked flawlessly and instanly hooked up with my other phones and my laptop. The camera is as good as any other cell phone camera that promises 1.3MP. In short, what this phone promised ... it delivered. However, I was disappointed mainly because it appeared that the user interface was not as cleverly designed as the physical package. The phonebook only allows three phone entries per name. Looking up names, you can only search by typing the first letters of the last name. For example, suppose you have an entry for ""John Smith"" - if you use the search feature and type in ""Jo"" it will NOT list all the Johns. You have to search for ""Sm.."". Why? Sure you can sort the phone by either the first or last name, but you can only search using one or the other. Not both. My Nokia and Ericsson could do both. Another phonebook problem - suppose you've just called someone's home and now you want to call their cell. You have to start the search over. It doesn't remember your last search. Headset works fine. But if you have the headset on and the phone rings, you don't hear the ring through the earpiece. The phone rings normally and you activate the call by pressing the button on the headset. That sort of negates the purpose. You can listen to MP3s using the headset, but since the headset uses a proprietary connector, you can't use your ""good"" headphones. Maybe when the phone becomes more popular, adapters to standard headphones will be made. The keys under the screen aren't soft - meaning they cannot be reassigned. The left button opens the menu and the right buttom opens the phonebook. My Nokia let me reassign these keys - so, because I use SMS a lot, I could assign one key to open up the message center. Speaking of keys - the entire keypad is nearly flat. This makes it hard to ""feel"" for a key (while driving for example). I don't have particularly large fingers, but I found myself making a lot of mistakes. Another irritating problem - each menu option has a submenu but the submenus have no relation to one another. (This is a hard one to explain). For example, you are going through your list of audio files. You want to delete one. You click ""Options"" and you get a submenu of seven items. #6 is ""Delete"". You can scroll down, but it is faster to just type in the number 6 as a shortcut. So far so good. Now, you are going through your text messages. You want to delete one. The submenu shows the delete as #7. You want to delete a phonebook entry, the delete is #4 in the submenu. No consistency makes it very hard to use shortcuts. All my prior phones had a dedicated ""Clear"" button that can be used anywhere - but if the people at Samsung don't want to ""waste"" a button, they should've at least made the submenus more consistent. By the way, everytime you delete something it asks you if you want to delete ""All or Selected"" - this is an unnecessary step. You can listen to MP3s, but you can't use them as ringtones unless they are converted to 3gp. This is as easy as changing the extention from .mp3 to .3gp on your computer before uploading the song (via bluetooth or USB). Why the extra step? Battery life is terrible. As expected, using the MP3/video player causes a serious drain on your power. One thing I found weird - after listening to MP3s on the phone during a 1-hour flight, the phone became quite warm. I'm not sure if this will affect the phone's general life-span. The beautiful case looks shiny and great - but it smudges really easily. If you aren't using a headset and you have to press this phone to your ear, be prepared for major smudgeness - especially after a long phone call. Another weird thing - you can only use the supplied charger to charge this phone. Even if you have another Samsung phone, you can't use another phone's charger. All my Nokia phones used the same charger. I ended up returning the phone on the last day of my 14-day trial period. It just didn't deliver what I needed, and the annoyances were just too much for me. I am still waiting for the perfect phone - one that combines the best features of all the other phones. I want the appearance of this Samsung (I love the way it looks and feels), but I want the features in all the other phones. I also want it to use standard plugs.",negative,low,

2025-08-15T07:49:43.040319Z,"After considerable research, I finally took the plunge and purchased my first smartphone, Motorola's Q Global 9h. I had used a PDA off and on but was disenchanted with docking stations, stylus usage, and carrying both a phone and a PDA. I am extremely pleased with this purchase but bear in mind, I have not owned other brands. Compared to similar offerings, the Motorola Q is much slimmer and lightweight. I was attracted to its functionality, its looks, and its potential to do what I needed done. The voice and sound qualities of the phone exceed my expectations as does the built in camera. I have not yet tried to use the music aspects but that was not important to me in my selection. The full QWERTY keyboard is easy to use compared to others in this class and the interface to the internet is very easy to manipulate. Its voice recognition component has been outstanding so far. The standard battery has been so functional to this point, that I have not even charged the extended battery. Since my corporate system is based on Windows, I needed a Windows Mobile software unit to sync with my corporate requirements. I was amazed with how quickly I was able to sync with my work units, how quick the interface is, and how accessible my emails and corporately based data is now available in my handset wherever I am in the US or world (mostly). All my contacts, my calendar, and all incoming emails appear in my handset within seconds of arriving at my office computer. I especially appreciate the ability to receive my Windows based email from work on my MOTO Q9h but also my email from accounts at AOL and Yahoo. One glance at the screen and I can see email waiting on my Outlook account, my AOL account, a text message, and any voicemails. I assume other smartphones can do this, but it is pretty slick, nonetheless. All in all, this is a great smartphone and I am extremely pleased with it.

The device itself looks fine, not too dorky in my opinion. It also has a nice blue LED light. Available in many colors of choice. Why 3 stars? The volume control is hardly palpable. It is hard to adjust the volume while in use. Your fingers may tend to slipped while trying to adjust. Even the call button is difficult to press.

Personally I prefer the clamshell type of phone, but my daughter has moved on to the smartphones. Anyway, at the time these were first put out, they were amazing phones. Very sleek, very useful, tons of features. The only really annoying trait of all of the Moto Razr phones is that the glass is horribly thin and flimsy, and is very easy to break (both inner and outer glass). Good luck finding replacement glass for it - and when you do, expect to pay $15 bucks for it. When you replace the glass, if you don't position it just right, it's easy to break again, because it will be possible to put too much pressure on it. It's not possible to remove it and reposition it, because the glue is so sticky and the glass so thin, that you'll break it just getting it off again. These days you can buy a flip phone with more features for $30 bucks. Yes, I still prefer flip phones. They call them ""throw back"" phones now. Funny, I just call them a good buy :) But not this one, not any more. Skip this and get something newer.",positive,low,precio

I can create play lists in Windows Media Player on my desktop and when I connect the Treo using the USB cable my play lists are automatically synced to the storage card. I have two major complaints about this phone. First of all, it's like Windows 95 -- I have to ""reboot"" it every day -- and I don't have any extra software installed other than what comes with the phone. People will frequently tell me they called and got voice mail but my phone did not ring -- when I try to turn on the phone it won't turn on. I have to remove the battery cover and use the stylus to push the reset button. If it's going to lock up that much, at least they should make the reset button more easily accessible. Second, my favorite feature, the voice commands, frequently just doesn't work. When it does work it's incredible -- you push the button on the wired headset and say the right command and you can play music, call any one of your contacts, and I believe you can do other things I haven't tried yet.

2025-08-15T07:49:43.409800Z,"I bought the Jawbone 2 when it came out because it was supposed to be the best headset out there. It wasn't. First of all, the headset would not stay in my ear no matter what, without an ear loop. I don't mind that so much but the ear loops that come with the headset are too short, so the headset has a habit of slipping until it points straight down or falls off. Eventually, I found sound Jabra ear pieces that fixed all my fit-problems and I had a pretty decent experience with the headset since (also, the styling matched my Switcheasy Serpent iPhone case exactly, which was cool). The NoiseAssassin is very effective (provided you don't have a beard... or a very thin beard at most). However, about 9 months in, audio coming out of the headset started sounding distorted and buzzy. It got worse and worse until I set it aside because I couldn't understand people any more, just using the clunky iPhone earbuds instead. Recently, I contacted Jawbone support to see if they had any ideas, explaining that I'd had it since it first came out. First, they had me perform a reset on the headset. When that didn't work, they said they'd replace it. I was actually pretty stoked since I didn't expect that sort of offer. So I gave them my information and faxed them a copy of my receipt (I ordered it directly from them, I should add). It took a week of email tag since they claimed they couldn't open any of the files I emailed to them (including PDF's and even a plain-text file), so I had to fax it from work (who uses faxes any more?). A week later, I get a call from them - saying that my warranty had expired a month prior and they wouldn't replace the headset. What? I was under the impression that they understood I'd had the thing forever (I mentioned it several times in my correspondence). I pointed that out as well as the fact that I wasn't aware the thing had a warranty at all and I was just happy they were going to replace it out of a commitment to good service. Guess not. Instead, I would up being lied to and having my time wasted. It's partially my fault for waiting so long to get a hold of them, but customer service people really shouldn't go making promises they have no intention of keeping. That's absolutely unacceptable. Since I have to buy a brand new headset now, I'm going to go with Logitech, whose products and customer service ALWAYS exceed my expectations. This was my last Jawbone.",negative,high,envío

There are two small holes at the top for speakers which work well. The frustrating part about this case is that you are not able to use the phone through the plastic (at least I wasn't on my Droid) and taking your phone in and out of the case on a run is near impossible. Also, sometimes when I put my phone into the case it hits buttons and the volume goes way up or it turns the music off altogether. But that might just be my phone. My boyfriend borrowed the armband the other day and used it with his iPhone. He was somewhat able to use his phone through the plastic cover which was nice.

The problem is that I wanted to take my Sprint number with me. I looked up the information and to my complete dismay, Amazon, currently does not have a relationship with Cingular to deal with number portability. They have an agreement with every single other mobile phone company they sell plans and products for. So basically you are instructed to contact Cingular to cancel your order and re-order with them but by doing that you are becoming ineligible to receive Amazon rebates, ie the whole reason I bought the phone from Amazon. It is my right to be able to take my number with me and I feel ripped off that it will cost me $150 to do so.",neutral,low,precio

2025-08-15T07:49:43.824815Z,"This is a truly lovely wireless phone with excellent comfort, portability, range and noise cancellation. I've been using it for several months in a very noisy server room environment. Having gone through multiple supposedly ""noise canceling"" phones, this is the first one that really passed muster with customers. I had been using this on my standard phone line and integrated it with my laptop's Outlook directory. Simple, easy and excellent! Within 5 minutes I had 200 contacts loaded onto the phone. It's nice that you can manually edit the phone numbers and contact information before they're loaded onto the phone so you don't wind up with extraneous data. I just switched over to using VOIP instead of a phone line, and decided to use this with my Mac instead of Windows. Honestly, it's not so good. Unlike other phones that are specifically designed to be VOIP phones, you can't dial the phone through the handset anymore - you have to use the softphone. You can answer and disconnect calls, but that's all. The software for the Mac is not as mature as it is for the PC, either. The Calisto Pro utility for the Mac frequently loses connectivity to the Mac and doesn't show up in the utility bar that it's lost its connection. So, you'll be dialing away through the softphone only to hear your party answering - and you're not audible. It's not a very professional image to present if you're using this for work, as I do. So far, the software for Windows is more reliable. No matter which operating system - once you have a successful connection, sound quality is excellent. The earpiece is very comfortable and the device has wonderful range. I'd like to see Plantronics improve the quality, reliability and feature set of the VOIP offering for this device. Otherwise, it's a pretty expensive wireless USB headset - albeit one with excellent clarity and range.",positive,low,calidad

2025-08-15T07:49:43.873346Z,"Overall, I've been extremely satisfied with Motorola's H7XX series. I actually purchased the H710 and about the time the warranty was to expired I used it. On Motorola's mistake, they sent me a H715 instead. I didn't immediately notice though but little things were different. The black shade was a little different and then I noticed ""tones"". Tones when I would connect, disconnect, etc. that I did not have with the H710. I like both colors and they both go good with my original iPhone. I think amazon has the best price on both of these... I would highly recommend them. I am currently testing the Plantronics Voyager Pro and notice that it doesn't like my blackberry. It works fine with my original iPhone but the voice quality isn't as great as it was with the H7XX series. I'm returning it and requesting a replacement to see if it was just that one headset. I'm really rooting for the PRO. I find the H7XX series are easier to carry in the pocket as it folds nicely. The PRO feels great and the smallest ear rubber piece works great for my ears. I've had the headset on for hours and using the smallest ear rubber has worked the best. But enough of the Pro. Thank you for your time. UPDATE 01/09/2012 These Motorola H7XX series seem to have about a 10-16 month lifespan. And still I love them. I have used the Motorola warranty right before the 1 year limit and have received either a refurbished or a brand new one which again last about another year or so. So with that I will drop my overall rating to a 4 STAR.",positive,low,precio|calidad
2025-08-15T07:49:43.881063Z,"I purchased this product because the cell phone reception in my house is horrible. Before I bought the product I climbed on the roof and verified that I had three bars and good call clarity. I fist tried mounting the antenna the peak of the roof line with the base unit in the basement. Didn't seems to work too well. My coax ran within 4"" and perpendicular to a 110V power line, so I repositioned the coax to emlimante this interference with no improvement, sometimes I would get a little better signal but not really a usable signal. So I went out and bought an antenna mount with a 10 foot mast and mounted the antenna at the peak of the roof, I placed the base station in the basement on the floor. This is as much vertical seperation as I can legally have as I am limited in antenna height, this is at least 25 feet of vertical seperation. I still cannot figure out the blinking lights on the base unit after reading the manual several times as they all blink in various patterns pretty much constantly. I don't think there is anything else I can do to improve the installation per the instructions. Now sometimes I get pretty good reception standing by the base unit (3 bars) and about 2 bars on my main floor but other times the system does not appear to be functioning at all. The system seems to be really flakey in the fact that it works sometimes okay but other time not really at all. I have to say I am dissapointed because I spent allot of time trying to get the system installed correctly with poor results and the unit was very expensive without good results, I pretty much feel like I wasted $300.",negative,low,precio

Cannot see caller ID, missed messages etc. When keying in phone numbers that you are calling, numbers are large and legible but all else is horrible. Of course this is standard to all LCDs(read modern screens) verses older VGA(read much better resolution and contrast). I am about to relicense my older LG phone with VGA. Software menu's are much harder to use then older menu layout and software on previous LG's. The absolute worst defect(feature?) is when you receive a call, it is almost impossible to retrieve from your pocket without touching the call interruption button on the outside edge of the phone. This of course disconnects the call and with the crummy screen and you are outside, it is impossible to tell who was calling that you disconnected. This design flaw could be very easily corrected by several means that would take even a full blown idiot about 5 minutes to think up. Possibly requiring 2 rapidly hits to the disconnect button to cut off a call. There are other simple ideas to resolve this problem. This was a problem with my previous LG. You would think that these miscreants that design this stuff would use it in the real world before foisting there newest bright ideas on to the unsuspecting consumer. In other words to see what us chickens are eating out here. I do not like the way the square edge of the earpiece fits my ear. The more rounded oval type edges are far better for getting audio into the ear canal. As noted by others, the keyboard sucks. Would be nice if some commonly used keys were color coded so that in daylight when keys(they are flat and very reflective) are hard to see, they would be more user friendly. Do like the slimline of the phone and its high tech look. Only reason that I upgraded(?) phone was to gain bluetooth but am finding that my older phone was far more ergonomically user friendly.

Also, the range is less than ideal, I found it rather limited when I tested it and compared to other BT headsets on my phone. All of these are unfortunate, but not completely crippling, for the overall usability of the headset. I even tried contacting BlueAnt's technical support department, in case I had a bad unit, but only ever received an email confirming they got my original report of an issue...

I read lots of reviews on amazon and cnet and the Blue Ant Z9i is the only one that I came across with a 5 star rating. That was 2 weeks ago and I see it's now down to a 4 star rating. I have no complaints about the audio quality. I'm hearing impaired and wear hearing aids so I do need to take 1 of the hearing aids out to use the headset but I was still able to understand conversations crystal clear on the other end. I encountered some statis a few times but when I moved around a bit that seemed to disappear. I asked several people on the other end how my voice sounded and they all said it was fine. So no complaints about the audio. The fit however, is another story. Once the headset was in my ear for a few seconds with the ear hook on it was ok and I didn't really notice too much that it was in. But getting it into my ear wasn't a smooth process. Either I have very smell openings on my ears or the ear bud is on the large side. I did manage to get it in and for the most part it was comfortable enough that I wouldn't complain about it. But if I had to rate it on it's fit I would not give it 5 stars. the ear hook was an issue from day one. Because I wear hearing aids I switched back and forth each day between my left and right ears so that my hearing aid batteries drained evenly. The first time I switched the postion of the ear hook it came detached from the unit and although I was able to get it on well enough to stay on my ear, I knew it wasn't as secure as it could or should be. I was constantly checking to make sure it was still sitting on my ear properly. I think they could've done a much betterjob designing a sturdier ear hook. I'm also visually impaired and can't really see the display all that well so the only functions I used were turning the powere on + off, always checking to make sure the up volume button was as high as it goes, and pressing the MFB to use voice activation to dial calls. I can't comment on the other features such as call waitinig, muting, etc because I didn't use them. I just ordered a replacement bluetooth headset and went with the Motorola H700 this time. The ear hook seems to be better constructed and I think I'll like it better just touching my ear rather than jamming a too big earbud into my ear. My hearing aids that go into my ears are nowhere near as big as this headset. If the earhook and earbud aren't issues for you you'll like this headset just fine.",neutral,low,calidad

2025-08-15T07:49:44.470709Z,"Great product over all! With the replaceable foam in-ear buds you get the best bass frequencies that this product can produce! (Downside, with any headphones for that matter: Awareness of your surroundings are severely impaired and reduced to only hearing loud noises, use regular in-ear buds for sketchy areas of travel) As noted, the stereo cable breaks very easily on the hook, at the connecting joints, and there are ***NO MORE REPLACEMENTS IN PRODUCTION***. The replacement stereo cable has been discontinued indefinitely, as well as this product. The only replacements I could find are second generation found only on Ebay.com and in my opinion, look horrible connected to such a sophisticated and elegant device. I am not even sure how I broke the stereo cable but if I were to guess, I sat on them. I just took them out of my side leg pocket after I sat down on the train/rail/subway and they were broken. After months of trying to find the actual replacement stereo cable, I bought an entirely new unit and don't intend on having it leave the house too often. I am also getting a cheap side holster / waist case for it when it does leave the house, no more pockets for this beautiful Bluetooth stereo headset / headphones. (I also purchased the Sony Ericsson HBH-IS800 Stereo Bluetooth Headset for outside the house music listening, they still look awesome, cheaper, much smaller, less bulky, still Bluetooth, and look much less likely to break). Connection interruptions during skateboarding (righty) while iPhone 4 was in my right pocket (Bluetooth in right ear), others had same problem with running. Solution, ARM BAND, a waist clip might not work 100%. Remember, your body will block Bluetooth reception, its not like WiFi. Bought from Amazon.com July 3rd, 2011. I bought my second one here as well :) Pros and reasons why I bought this product: It comes with everything I wanted, Bluetooth stereo headphones, volume controls, answer button, main button, extremely comfortable foam in-ear buds, and the sliding boom was the main factor that ultimately made me buy this product.

2025-08-15T07:49:44.524061Z,"The E51 is sleek, built for style and productivity...a rare combination that means popularity with true merit. So I'm quite puzzled that this phone isn't being pushed as much as the N95. It's got the right dimensions, not too heavy in the shirt pocket, feels good in my hand, the keypad has excellent touch and layout with 1-press keys for Calendar, Contacts, Email, Bluetooth (on/off) and Silent/General mode. It's real cool that the 1-press keys for Calendar, Contacts and Email have different modes. Short press starts the app (Calendar, Contacts, Email). Long press starts a new record within the app (new calendar entry, new contact, new message). I've re-assigned the 1-press key for Email to start the Messaging app, and long press starts the CryptoGraf Messaging app to encrypt my messages. There's WLAN internet access with a proper browser. The camera, with just 2 MegaPixels, is good enough for my needs. The screen is crystal clear and good for viewing video and images. BTW, I thought it gets scratched quite easily, but that's just the plastic screen protector. I removed the screen protector and the screen stays scratch free even after I put the phone in my trouser pocket along with my keys. Another feature that makes the upgrade from E50 to this E51 a great idea...there's a font setting for adjusting the menu font sizes to Large, Medium, Small. Voice call quality is quite good. The speakers are also quite good but they're awkwardly located on the back. The volume controls on the side of the phone are not easy to use...it's quite confusing that the 'cursor key' acts as a volume control for the media player, but the voice call volume control is on the side of the phone. The CPU is very fast at 350MHz, Bluetooth 2.0+EDR, Mini USB 2.0, 2.5 mm A/V connector.

2025-08-15T07:49:44.789106Z,"I've had my T-Mobile Sidekick II (produced by Danger, Inc for Sharp) since December 2004. I got one because my pal Leo Laporte got one. We seem to trade tech fetish material back and forth, he convinced me to buy a Sidekick just by talking about it, I came on his show to pimp the Playstation Portable (more on that in another article). It's a fun little game we play. Now, let me preface this article by saying that I really really despise PDAs. I used to have a Palm III, IIIe, and IIIc back from 1999-2000. I may have hated them because I had no life to organize, but I came away from the PDA fad revolution thinking they were an utter waste of time. I still do today, and PDAs seem to be getting even more expensive by the day and don't do what a person needs them to. There are many types of cell phones that have tried this formula and failed, and many successful ones which are not as tactile as this phone (the Blackberry, Treo 600 and Treo 650 for instance). There are also insanely expensive phones like the Sony-Ericsson P900 which are basically just a Palm unit in a phone (aka a ""smart"" phone)... who the hell wants to use a stylus to pick a telephone call up? I'd like to meet `em. The Sidekick is a totally different beast. It's essentially a kinda-chunky cell phone combined with a few communication utilities that people actually use and a 640480 integrated digital camera. There is an AIM client built in, a Yahoo Messenger client that is downloadable free inside the unit, a semi-full-featured POP-compatible e-mail client, a web browser, and my killer app, the $10 downloadable SSH Terminal client. It also has a few things I don't use like a basic scheduler and to-do list. I can't say there's a feature other than the last two I listed that I don't use on this phone. It's a marvel of engineering and a phone that clearly was designed by geeks (the calculator app says `31337&#8242; on the application icon's display), but is also insanely user friendly and every button on the unit does what you'd think it would do in applications on the phone. The sidekick uses some form of java to serve up it's programs and is decently fast. Certainly not breaking any speed records but it does what it needs to do. The AOL Instant Messenger client gets a LOT of use by me, I always have this on when I'm walking around, and the implementation of this on the phone is insanely good. It's almost as tactile to use as AIM on a laptop and typing to others using the qwerty keyboard is so fast most of my friends do not even realize they're talking to me on it while I'm driving 70 miles per hour down the highway going somewhere. The second most used feature is definitely the Sidekick's built in 640480 camera. It is pretty terrible in low light situations (sometimes I have to hold the camera steady for up to 5 seconds to get it to ""adjust"" to the light so you can even see anything), however I still use it very often and having it nearby has become an almost invaluable resource for documenting strange things I see everywhere. Once the photo is taken the built in mail program on the sidekick can send it to any email address you can think of in seconds. I absolutely love this feature. The mail client on the Sidekick is very impressive. You can have up to 4 email addresses active, in addition to the provided @tmail.com address you get with the phone. The phone fully supports POP email as well and grabs new mail from T-Mobile's server in a sort of ""push"" fashion every 15 or 30 minutes (I am not sure on the exact interval). Pictures can be viewed and sent in email, and you can tell it to strip attachments of different types to save on phone memory, which comes in very handy since the unit only has 6MB of storage space to store mail in. I am not sure why they skimped in this department, but they made tools to keep it easy to manage the mail coming in, such as an auto-delete after X days feature to keep you below your 6MB memory limit. Contacts pop up based on the email address you filled into their phone book entry in your phone and it supports fuzzy searches of a few letters allowing you to scroll and quickly select the person you were looking for to add to the email list. The web browser on the sidekick leaves a little to be desired. It does not support JavaScript and has a bit of difficulty with frames, and with images turned on some sites don't load at all or load insanely slow. I turned images off on my sidekick to speed up browsing since I usually use it to find phone numbers or addresses anyway. It is fast enough now with the images turned off on the web browser but I hope by the time the Sidekick 3 rolls around there will be faster data networks in place and better software. One of the features that does not come on the Sidekick by default is the Terminal program. Useful only to real geeks and unix/linux nerds, this feature allows you to remotely control any unix based machine via a secure shell. I use this currently to SSH into a linux machine I have sitting at home that has irssi on it (a popular command line irc client) - so I can use IRC from the road. I take credit for discovering this feature myself and turning Leo on to it. Dan 1, Leo 0 :) . This is just a killer app for any nerd who wants to chat anywhere, anytime. Boring movie or dinner? Just whip this out and talk to people who aren't boring to you. Other than those three features, some neat features the Sidekick has are: - Reflective TFT screen: Even in broad sunlight the LCD is easy to read, an essential thing for using this outside. The sun reflects off the LCD making it even brighter than the built in backlight. - Flip up screen with qwerty keyboard / scroller: Both are a godsend. The scroll wheel is very intuitive also. - Picture Phone Book Entries: you can snap a photo of your friend and attach it to their phonebook entry, so every time they call you see their ugly face grinning at you. - Ability to view JPG, GIF, PDF and WAV files: Hallelujah! Picture format support is excellent for a device like this. You can also play WAV files... I've been told you can assign WAV files to ring tones but haven't bothered with it yet. - Games: Many many downloadable games for this including a version of Snake called Snake DX. The standard cell phone fare, not very good graphics but sorta fun. Here's my summary of this unit. Pros: + Excellent Mail, AIM, and Terminal programs + Excellent screen for the size + Insanely well designed user interface! Both hardware and software! + Flip-out hidden QWERTY keyboard is amazing. + Only has the stuff you need and nothing else + Nationwide AIM and IRC! I'm in heaven! Cons: - Battery only lasts about 1.5 days - Slightly bulky (didn't bother me much) - Web browser is slow with images turned on - Camera has poor low light performance - No bluetooth support - High price (around $300) if you don't buy it with a plan, but who cares! My final call: Buy this thing if you possibly can! It is $20/mo on top of your existing T-mobile plan for unlimited data, or $25/mo if you do not want phone service. People constantly stop me when I'm out and ask me about this thing. It is a head-turner, that's for sure. It's so good that I almost regret owning a laptop these days.",negative,low,precio

The other problem is again associated with outdoor installation. They give you ab. 30 feet of coaxial cable which is great. The problem is that BOTH ends are finished with the crimped attachment hardware....try getting THAT through the existing cable hole to the outside. So, another trip to the hardware store 17 miles one way to get a crimping tool and masonry bits and screws to PROPERLY attach the mounting hardware for the signal atenna on the OUTSIDE brick.

2025-08-15T07:49:44.914709Z,"After losing my last Plantronics 510 to a ""dog incident"", I picked up another 510, a Motorola H710 and a Jabra BT8040 and put them to the test head-to-head. I use a Uniden cordless land-line phone that can pair with a BT headset, and a Palm Centro smartphone. All three of these phones support multipoint. The H710 failed to cancel echo (my voice played back to me delayed) on the Uniden phone, and the BT8040 would not pair with the Uniden at all. All three worked well with the Centro. All three headsets had very good audio quality in quiet environments. The 510 was best in noisy and windy environments. The H710 had the loudest volume and was easiest to hear callers. The BT8040 in extremely loud environments would apparently get confused in its echo cancellation algorithms and tend to experience audio cutouts (for the wearer, not the caller). The H710 has the best ""user interface"". Love how flipping the little boom mike open and closed turns on and off the headset. It's audio prompts are intuitive and pleasant. The BT8040 and H710 both have good button/LED usage designs. The BT8040 requires a 3-5 second button press to turn the phone on and off -- otherwise it is the user interface equal to the H710. In comparison, the 510 has a less polished interface. The power button is hard to use, and it constantly flashes a blue light when on, which grabs the attention of those around you -- a feature that I find quite annoying. The interface of the BT8040 is just as good, with the exception that on and off requires a 3-5 second button press -- less elegant than the H710's approach. The 510 has a big flaw in its user interface: a blue light flashes all the time it is on. Combined with its large size, the 510 annoyingly draws the attention of those around you. Pocketability is a big concern for me. The 510 isn't really pocketable. I never broke one in 3 years, but then almost never put it in my pocket for fear of breaking it. The H710 when off is nearly a sphere and is easily pocketable. The BT8040 is a micro-sized ""brick"" in shape, smaller than the H710 and about equally pocketable. Headset fit is another bit concern. The 510 is the most comfortable for me. The BT8040 is second, which surprised me. The H710's hard ear-loop rubs on my ear in one spot and pretty quickly becomes uncomfortable. The 510 isn't amenable to glasses, but the other two are. All of the headsets are secure. The 510 fits well as a result of its design. The BT8040 fits well, in part because it is so very small and light. The H710 'hangs' and 'flaps' against the ear, is the least secure of all three, but didn't ever fall off when I was testing it. Battery life is good on all units. I don't talk enough to give them a hard workout in this regard. However, the 510 seems to take the longest to charge, the BT8040 the fastest, and the H710 in the middle. I found the H710 to be the worst of the three. It's performance in noisy conditions doesn't compare well to the others. It's fit is the worst, at least on my ear. The H710 is definitely the loudest of the three, which could be a boon for many headset wearers. Just don't plan on using it in very noisy situations.",positive,low,calidad

2025-08-15T07:49:44.956364Z,"I had this phone for two days before trading it in for a cheaper, sturdier phone. I was absolutely in love with the features but in the end the actual hardware convinced me to return it. The good: It comes with windows mobile 6, which includes windows explorer, word, excel and powerpoint (read and edit). It also has a sharp 2.0 megapixel camera and a decent video recorder. My favorite feature was the touch screen which responded well to my fingers as well as the included stylus. It has handwriting recognition and virtual keyboard for input. You can press the talk button to bring up a virtual keypad, and in general I found it quite easy to make phone calls. I only used the wifi card with the internet and found it to be pretty fast, although browsing the web tends to drain the battery. Even so, you can get a good two days use out of it if you remember to turn the wireless card off when not using it, otherwise it'll constantly be searching the area and will empty the battery in hours. Also, as others have said, the phone has a very nice soft rubbery feel to it. It's also a very pretty phone with rich colors. The bad: I almost never used the slide out keyboard because it's very flat and has a slippery plastic feel. Also there was a delay when you slid it out when the phone tries to reorient itself. In general the phone is a little slow, due to its 201 MHz processor, and you'll have to constantly close out programs in order to keep in running smoothly. When the keyboard is closed, it doesn't lock in, so that it's always wiggling around. This is especially annoying when you're on the phone for a while. It also comes with very little memory. With all the programs, you won't have enough room in the internal memory for even one song, so purchasing extra memory is a must. The phone is also quite bulky and fragile, so you'll be paranoid about dropping it. In the end I was sad to return it because it's got some really amazing features, but I just couldn't justify the price with all the flaws.",negative,low,precio

The reception is 3 bars upstairs in my house and 2 bars downstairs. Call quality is better than the previous phones I have owned (old sprint one, and motorola startac). Changeable faceplates gives the phone a customizable touch. Ring tones sound a bit fuzzy with the phone open it seems but when shut sound fine. A very odd variety of ring tones as well.

The outbound audio is tinny and sometimes distorted. The earpieces designed to rest in the ear canal have been designed with too much tolerance in their interface with the base unit so when you twist them on, they easily fall off. This makes putting the device on your ear an extreme challenge. I finally had to use a small amount of adhesive to bond the earpiece to the device so it would not fall off every time I put in on my ear. This is a classic example of functional design coming up way short of very good aesthetic design. Don't bother buying this until they fix it.",positive,low,calidad
2025-08-15T07:54:26.751703Z,"This is possibly the best bluetooth I have ever owned. It can function as a standalone headset while still playing wireless audio or you can add the attachment for wireless stereo music. It comes with multiple ear attachments to fit different exterior ear shapes and interior ear sizes. Very durable which is what really amazes me. I inadvertantly dropped this thing in the middle of a snow storm at my home and thought, ""Oh, crap. I just lost $80."" I waited a moth later and I found the head set after the snow melted. I charged it, used it, and it worked just like new! I was amazed at this little things hardiness considering it also takes daily beatings from my 1 and 3 year old. The sound quality is excellent and does not receive much interfernce like others I have used. If my bluetooth music skips it usually isbecause the cellular radio on my phone is on which interfers on most any cell phone, so if it is off it plays flawlessly. It works well at a distance up to the advertised 30 feet and syncs nicely to my PC. It has the AD2P functionality with I believe 2.1 BT firmware. It stays nicely in your ear so you can hear your audience well and does not move much if fitted properly to your ear, even when running though I would not recommend it for jogging. I wish this used a normal USB mini charger but if that is the only fault that is pretty good. As for the buttons and media functions like voice dialing and pause/play/next the headset works very well although not as well on Android phones. By this I mean that sometime you need it hit buttons twice to make it work and sometimes the audio does not pick up on command but call quality and music quality are very good. Windows Mobile phones work flawlessly with it as I'm sure Blackberrys and other smart phone would. I will note the first one I got (which I admit was used) worked terribly after a month, but you pay for what you get which is especially true with bluetooth headsets. I have seen others go as high as $200 and yet this one works well for an average pricing. I have bought headsets for $10, $30, $80, and $200 and more often than not the more you pay for it the better it works. Happy listening.

2025-08-15T07:54:26.805948Z,"UPDATED Feb 9th 2008: Well the BT5020 is now dead, I'm sending it back to jabra and we will see from there what happens. Following my initial review I returned the unit for replacement once and that fixed some of the sound issues, not all of them but enough that I was acceptably pleased. Over the 6 months I found the unit to be functional and seldom did it offer me reason to complain, the sound was clear and I could be heard without many ever offering complaint, unless I was outdoors in a wind, but I think some aspects are to be understood and tolerated. I will note though, using the dual connection capability was nice, but glitchy, especially when hooked to a nextel and using direct connect, then things truly got fouled up and generally connections were lost to the phones and often calls. Over all I won't lower or raise my review on this unit, it worked when it worked and while far from stellar, I think for 30 bucks it was acceptable. ________________________________________________________________ I'm new to the BT ear piece market, this being my second in the past few months. My first was/is the Jabra BT500, which is very enjoyed... once I got used to tolerating the eargel discomfort, and no adjustability for fit. So my hopes were high with the BT5020, in getting rid of the eargels and allowing for some angle and length of speaker position, would fix my comfort levels. So my first impressions of the BT5020 was wow, this is comfortable, it weighs less, no eargel and the size is very balanced with the over all package. Turned on the power and it started in pair mode, and paired without a glitch or bump with my Sanyo 8400. So far so good, I was working in the yard, so decided to leave it on and see how I liked the fit and feel. And to speak straight, I forgot I had it on and got the sudden reminder of it real quick when my wife called, the vibrate alert went off (I'd forgotten it had vibrate alert) and I nearly came unglued tell I recalled what was doing it. This thing is that comfortable, no feeling like my ear is plugged up, no strange pulling or pushing, or slippage to keep telling me I have something on/in my ear. The phone call however set off the first warning signs, there was very distinct static and crackling, this with my phone on my hip on the same side as the earpiece. I kept it in mind but kept working for a few hours before deciding to go and really play with my new earpiece. I started conducting some tests around the house, called customer service of my phone company, and figured to kill two birds with one stone. I had the phone on a shelf at the same level as my ear, about 3 feet away. The static wasn't noticed this time so I began moving around the room and it returned. After 9-12 feet distance, the static was so bothersome that if the CSR had answered, I'd not have been able to conduct business. I tried moving it closer and at different angles with varying results and little improvement. Static wasn't noticed as a background noise or white noise type, but direct distortion of voice and or background music (I was on hold a while), it changed with the volume/beat of the sound I was supposed to be hearing clearly. To say the least, right now I'm not pleased; I truly like the feel, fit, weight and appearance of this headset. There is a notable creak from the flexible portion but nothing I will notice after a few days of using something. The button position for those used to the BT500, as I am, is a little different as it is a bit harder to tap the answer/end button, for you can't really just pinch the end of the mic area and catch the button, as you can with the BT500, but those are small things and a few days of playing will pan out if they become larger issues. I've worn wired headsets for years, mostly Plantronic or Jabra versions'; so moving to BT has been a learning experience. I'm not going to give up on the BT5020 just yet, I'm going to further test it over the weekend, at work where I'll have multiple other phones and radios on or around my person, at times talking on various radios of various frequencies. I think this will truly tell me if the BT5020 can hold mustard, or if it gets packed up on Monday and sent back, something I'm usually ill tolerant of doing unless something is truly truly broken and/or a turd.",negative,high,calidad

2025-08-15T07:54:26.852249Z,"I should start by saying this is my first Bluetooth device, so I was pleased at how easily this paired to my phone (Samsung Galaxy S -- another reviewer complained that Samsung didn't allow third-party device pairing, which obviously is no longer true) following the instruction manual (whose usefulness sadly sort of ends there). I should also say I didn't pay full retail but rather bought through a Hong Kong eBay seller -- waited an eternity for shipping but got a real bargain, especially considering the device is far from perfect and not exactly worth full price. First and foremost, battery life. The description promises 8 hours? After two full charging cycles, I'm lucky to squeeze 3-1/2 to 4 out of it. Maybe that will improve over time, but doubling? I'm skeptical. Of course, it seems to give another hour or more of use after the low battery starts alarming, the problem is that's with an audible chime every 30 seconds or so that interrupts your music and is impossible to ignore. There's nothing in the manual about disabling this so I doubt it's possible. Second, the play/pause and rewind buttons are a bit hit-or-miss. Not a dealbreaker, but I would have felt a little shafted if I had paid full retail. I was a tad disappointed in the range. I had hoped to use this while working nights at a vet hospital, but concrete walls proved too great an obstacle. Works well with the phone in the room with me though. Those are my only complaints really. The volume is great, even a little too loud at times. The hands-free works well and my callers say I sound fine. I like keeping this tucked under my shirt while biking and eliminating the obtrusive headphone wire extending all the way to my handlebars, and I can correctly hit the buttons through my shirt about 90% of the time thanks to the ridged edges. I especially love that I set this up with my Tasker app so just connecting the BT automatically launches my bike computer app, turns on GPS, maximizes my screen brightness and media volume, and disables screen timeout*. In short, a cool little toy but don't settle for full retail price. 2-week update: It seems like the battery life is getting worse rather than better. Occasionally will get a ""bum connection"" where music stutters or puts weird choppy cuts in that screw up the beat, fixed by unpairing and re-pairing. With these shortcomings, I think they really have some stones asking such a high retail price for this thing. *This might be more of an endorsement for Tasker.",positive,low,precio|envío

2025-08-15T07:54:26.978923Z,"I love my iPhone 4. Problem is, if you take advantage of all the iPhone features (especially video streaming, or heavy photography) you can run through electrons pretty quickly. I previously used a Battery Case extender which is manufactured by a popular company, and really had no problems with it. The big ""but"" is, I'm an active guy; gym, running, and hiking. Most of the battery style cases don't offer much in the way of protection from moisture either from sweat, or the unanticipated rain shower while outside. I obtained an Otterbox Defender case, which I have found provides the best all around protection from both drops, scratches, and also moisture. Moving the phone between the two became a huge hassle just to get the phone charged up, and also I lost moisture protection when using the battery case. Enter the New Trent IMP500, which I found on Amazon.com and was intrigued by the large capacity given its' size. I purchased one, and also a Griffin coiled USB to 30pin Apple sync cable. I carry the IMP500 and coiled cord in a discreet runner's belt under my shirt which keeps it close at hand without committing the dreaded Fanny Pack fashion faux pas. The IMP500 comes with an retractable USB charging cable, with mini-USB and micro-USB adapters. This cable can be used both for charging the unit, or in reverse for powering any device utilizing a micro or mini-USB port (virtually all non-Apple wireless phones). I can plug in my Bluetooth headset when the unit isn't needed to power my iPhone. The construction seems sturdy, and the corners are rounded so that it can be carried close to the body, or in a pocket without generating discomfort. It features an on/off switch, and also a row of LEDs to indicate the unit's state of charge. At 5000mAh rating, it should provide several recharges to the iPhone without needed juice itself. I now have no hesitation at going on an overnight hike, and even using the iPhone GPS unit for navigation as I know I have a couple recharges left. As time passes, I hope I will be able to report more on the durability of the unit and also how well the battery retains it's rechargeability and life.",positive,low,

The 6710 was always a little slow and reception was spotty perhaps because of being limited to dual band coverage. Still it worked well enough all over the world. The 7290 is a great successor to the 6710. The color screen is far superior to the earlier 7200 series and it is easy to read without backlight in normal daylight conditions. The screen is also designed with a ""no glare"" finish that is very nice. The new device is quad band and so reception seems better in the areas that I travel in. A friend of mine is travelling in a remote part of Asia now with a new 7290 and he is giving it a big thumbs up. Not much to complain about. The older larger 6710 fit my hand better but such is life. Perhaps a little more use will turn up a few more quibbles. It is also convenient that the batteries from my 6710 fit the new device.

Sure, any writer is proud to be asked for his take, but how could I adequately review a regulatory cost recovery fee? I mean, nobody likes to pay fees. But this fee in particular is perhaps not as bad as the rest. You see, I'm one of those rare people who thinks regulations are a good idea. Especially utility regulations. Anyone who lived in California while Enron was bleeding electrical customers dry probably agrees that regulation is ultimately best. And this is the weird problem with cell phones: generally you aren't charged for long distance, hence the taxes usually charged for long distance can't be charged. The government was forced to put a fee on cell phone service. Now I know many of you are against taxes; I don't like paying taxes either. But ultimately, taxes and fees pay for a lot of things we take for granted, like utility regulations that keep our phone companies from bleeding us dry (for now). Frankly, I wish that most taxes and fees (especially payroll taxes) in favor of a steep progressive income tax that primarily taxed the wealthy, along with an estate tax that forced every American to start on a level playing field. Now THAT would be equal opportunity. But under our current tax system, this fee isn't so bad. Three stars out of five seems about right, although I hope the government starts regulating these insane text message rip-offs soon.

2025-08-15T07:54:27.623263Z,"This product is a mixed success in comfort. The band is comfortable on your neck, but the ear occluding earpieces are not as comfortable. As normal, the Motorola brand Bluetooth link works very well and the battery life is good. However, there are 2 problems - the earpieces suffer from the ""occlusion effect"", and 2 the stiff wires have bad touch noise. The ""occlusion effect"" is how your own voice sounds in your ears when you stick your fingers in your ear - you hear your own voice loudly, hear yourself swallow, and can even hear yourself breathe. The occlusion effect is undesirable in quiet environments and particularly if you are eating chips! Additionally, having the ear canal occluded makes the earpieces VERY sensitive to touch noise - touching the earpiece or when the stiff wire brushes against your collar produces a medium loudness scratchy noise in your ear. I understand why an occluded earpiece was used - because it can deliver great bass with extremely low power from the internal audio amplifier - but the occluded earpiece is annoying for long duration wear compared to buds that just sit in the bowl of your ear.

Both LED's are bright and the ""smiley face"" LED inside the pod allows you to see where the BlackBerry should be placed even in the dark. The slim design doesn't take up very much space. Prior to purchasing the pod, I was always fumbling around in the dark with the end of the power adapter and trying to figure out which direction to plug the end into my Pearl. Now, I just drop the Pearl into the pod without fumbling with a cord or trying to feel my way around in the dark. After several months, I decided to purchase a second pod for my desk. Again, the pod's slim design makes it great because it takes up very little space and I don't have to fumble with cables. The only thing I wish this pod did was allow for synching and data transfers. I don't transfer data to my BlackBerry very often, so I am constantly forgetting to unplug the cable from the pod and move it to the data port (mini USB port) on my BlackBerry Pearl 8100.

2025-08-15T07:54:28.673342Z,"Just a quick experience on this earpiece and a personal view of the company. I've owned several over the past 3 years and have been very happy with them until today. As I plugged in my earpiece to charge via the company supplied USB cable connected to my computer, I walked away and started to notice a burning smell. As I looked around to find the source, I saw smoke coming from my earpiece. The connection from the earpiece to the charging cable had melted. I unplugged the cable from my computer and moved the earpiece into the garage in case the battery was on fire and could explode. I then called Jawbone to let them know of the situation and if there was a service department that I could send the earpiece to for trouble shooting. The person on the other end of the phone told me that the charger was not meant to be used with a computer, really? 1: The user manual states: You can charge your Jawbone headset via the wall charger, or via USB on your computer. It shows a couple pics, one of the wall plug and one of the computer with nice little arrows pointing where you can plug it in. I know the spiel, give the company memo so as to lay blame on the consumer, great motto, profit over people. Works on the uneducated and those who are ignorant enough to believe you have their best interests in mind. I then explained I wasn't looking for a replacement as it's a few years old, I just wanted to send it in so they could identify the problem, nope, not something they deal with. So long story short, Jawbone won't correct problems in their products. The fire could have been caused by faulty connections in either the headset or charger, bad soldering, cheap wiring, but hey, why would they want to know that? Maybe because these could be components still in use by your company and you might, you know, want to fix something that can cost someone their home or their life? Jawbone makes a great product, no doubt, but without a hint of integrity and a profit over people corporate attitude, I won't be buying their products ever again.",negative,low,

2025-08-15T07:54:28.695208Z,"My Nuvi 200 survived the initial 1-year warranty. A few months later, the power started shorting out. Evidently, the minor torque created by the cord is enough to break the internal connection between the power cord and the battery. I opened the little bugger up and noticed that the only connection to the battery is through a small, metal cage which sits upon the charger. This is connected to the main body on one side and not very well. The single point of connection had been severed due to the simple swing of the power cord! I don't recommend this product. If you are looking for a GPS, please consider one of the products that has a much stronger power connection. While this one should last the warranty, it will likely break soon after with limited usage. The Garmin website allows people to ship an ensured package back to the dealer (shipping roughly $10-20) and have it repaired for $50. Not worth it in my opinion.

I thought it was the best looking one of the phones they offer, because I like phones small and thin and I also like them to have a good quality camera. They offer some phones with just a VGA quality camera but this one has a 1.3 megapixels camera. I'll keep this review short and just list the good and bad points about the phone. GOOD: * small * thin * you can watch cable TV channels, some LIVE, and some included free with the pictures pack. I watch CNN, FOX News, E!, etc. You can even watch The Disney Channel live and use video on demand to choose a certain episode of the show to watch from a list of episodes. This is a good feature for long car trips or bus trips if you get bored. BAD: * It is hard to hang up. You have to hit the end button 2 or 3 times to disconnect. * When watching TV you better have headphones because the sound is loud and if you hit the down button it goes mute. I had to cover the speaker on the back with my thumb just so I could hear without it blasting thru my whole office. * If you want to use headphones good luck because there is no headphone jack. You have to buy a separate mini-USB to headphone jack adapter. And you'll need one kind if you want to listen to TV or music (the stereo kind) and one kind if you want to use a phone headset (the mono kind). * They put the volume, camera, and ""action"" button on the flip part of the phone, so when you go to flip open the phone you hit these buttons with your fingers. I've accidentally disconnected people before just trying to get the phone open. On the left side of the phone you have just one inch of free space to open the phone. So you have to be very careful opening it so you don't hit any of these buttons. * No address book searching as another reviewer mentioned. You can filter by ""friends"", ""family"", etc. but theres no search feature. Happy scrolling! * Very hard to get to the mini SD card. * Front screen is black when not in use so you can't see the time unless you press a button or open the phone.

Just need to get a pre-paid SIM chip locally. - Can be charged from laptop using included USB cable. - It's BLACK. THE OK ====== - Passable voice quality.

Great ringtone sounds. Though these are pretty standard nowadays. - Decent bluetooth range.

THE BAD ======= - Short battery life. 7 hours talk-time as advertised is a imaginary. Phone starts to beep after 2-3 hrs of talking. - Organizer (calendar, alarm, notes, contacts) doesn't sync correctly with Outlook. - Oily screens!! The inside and outside screens and the metallic keypad get oily fingerprints after every use (is it just my skin?!) Looks yucky and kinda destroys all the aesthetics. Tried wiping now and then but notice minor scratches start to accumulate. (My clothes are not always cotton and I don't usually carry eye glass cloth.) - Low camera resolution.

The problem is that the Treo 600 is the most fragile phone I've ever encountered. A drop from even 12"" will break the display, which isn't replacable or covered by the warantee. Your only solution: buy a new phone. Sprint are amazingly unhelpful here. They are more than happy to sell you a new replacement phone to fulfill your contract ($600), but that's it. If you press them, Sprint will sell you a ""cheap"" phone to continue your contract for only $150, but they will not repair a Treo 600. Moving on to coverage, I found that in the San Jose area, Sprint had lousy coverage. When pressed, Sprint will insist that there are new towers coming on line every day, but over the course of a year I only saw the signal strength get worse. If you must buy the Sprint version of the Treo 600, BUY THE INSURANCE. Over the course of a two-year contract, you will replace the phone at least once. Ask youself this: would you rather pay $5 a month for insurance, $600 to replace a broken phone, or $150 to buy out your contract and start over with a new carrier? Bottom line: the Treo 600 is a great phone if you're willing to treat it like it's made of glass. When it breaks, you'll have to deal with Sprint's abysmal customer service. If Palm can solve their manufacturing problems, they'll have a winner. Until then, but the insurance and the best protective case you can find.",negative,high,precio|calidad

2025-08-15T07:54:29.865502Z,"A lot of people are complaining about this headset. I share some of their views, but this is still a good headset. Sadly, I may have to stop using it and search for another. I have had a few bluetooth headsets in the past, and have had trouble hearing with all of them. I would love to use a headset like the Motorola H700 (my wife uses that one and loves it). BUT, those headsets are not very adjustable. I have large ears--and when wearing headsets like the H700, the speaker is a good 1/2"" or more AWAY from the opening to my ear canal... The result is I cannot hear a phone conversation, even at max volume, when there is ambient noise. I drive a 1999 Jeep Grand Cherokee, which is a rather loud ride at 70mph, and I just can't hear well... Now with the Jawbone, I could hear. Some complain that the headset is painful. I have experienced this myself. HOWEVER--if you take some time to carefully bend and adjust the metal ear-hook, you will find that the jawbone is both comfy and will sit quite well on your head. The speaker is near my ear, so I can hear well. Now the bad-the durability of both the hook and the earpiece are awful. The unit ships with a 6 or 8 hooks (I forget--its 3 or 4 for each left or right ear). I have already broken 2 of them. Once I break this one, which I am sure I will, I will have to pony up another $10 to buy another set of hooks. I like to keep the headset in my pocket--and in doing so the hook will bend over time. That means I may have to bend it back to re-adjust the hook to fit my ear well. Bend a piece of metal enough and it will snap. The only way to stop this would be to wear the headset constantly or keep the headset in some other pocket away from any potential forces... The other piece of crappy hardware is the earbud. None of the earbuds were that great a fit for me, but I picked the best one I could find. The earbuds have a rubber portion (that touches your ear). The other side is a hard plastic connector--you place the earbud on the jawbone, and turn 90 degrees to attach it. This mechanism doesn't work. When placing the jawbone on your ear, you will often rub the earbud to your ear, which sometimes turns the earbud. Turn it 90 degrees, and it will fall off. As time goes, this attachment mechanism will wear down, making the earbud move around with even less force, meaning it will fall off constantly.... I just ordered the Jabra EarGels, hoping that they will be much better earbuds, and maybe secure enough to use without the hook. Who knows. As it is, I like the headset when the hook and earbud aren't BROKEN. But, I refuse to spend $10 for new hooks, and $10 for new earbuds each time they break... I want a headset that can be stored in blue-jean pockets without being destroyed!! Maybe the next version will eliminate these issues!",negative,high,precio|calidad

2025-08-15T07:54:29.921870Z,"The short version: rubbish! Way too quiet (especially in-call audio), poor audio quality (obnoxious noise on output) and worse outgoing speech quality. The longer version: Let me start by saying that the premise of the Kensington LiquidAUX Bluetooth car kit is a great one. You can stream music via Bluetooth's A2DP profile to your car stereo's aux connection, and the car kit will also route calls to your stereo, handling muting of music automatically. If only it worked as well as its premise. This was tested in my wife's Scion xB (an '06 - the smaller original version) with the factory head unit (a Scion-badged Pioneer) and an iPhone 3GS. My first impression upon connecting this up in my wife's car was that this would be a cool little car kit - installation and pairing was simple. However, that impression died as soon as I tried to start running audio through it. First of all, the audio from the car kit is way too quiet when playing music. On my wife's head unit, a volume setting of about 15 is reasonable for the radio at any speed, and 20 starts to get obnoxiously loud. CDs tend to be a little quieter on this system, but 20 or so is a reasonable volume for those. To reach a similar music volume from this car kit, this stereo has to be turned up to 40 or so. Worse, the call audio is even quieter, if that's possible. To make a call even vaguely audible, the stereo's volume has to be pushed up north of 50. Even then, it's still way too quiet. This is unforgivable as this is intended to be a completely hands-free kit. In order to hear a call, you have to reach for the stereo to turn the volume up at the start of the call, then you have to scramble to turn it way down again to avoid having your head taken off when the call ends and the music starts again. This is an enormous distraction for a device that's supposed to reduce the driver's workload. This isn't a function of this stereo's Aux input, either. We've run an iPod shuffle to the aux input for over a year now without having to crank the volume up beyond what's needed for a CD. I also tested the iPhone from its headphone output, and that was reasonable, too. I'm not really a fan of doing that, though - you usually have to turn the headphone volume way up to get the signal anywhere close to a standard line output, and that more or less guarantees that you'll forget to lower the volume afterwards and will subsequently have your head taken off the next time you plug your headphones in. Anyway, I digress. It's all a bit academic, however, as even if you can hear the person on the other end of the line, there's almost no chance whatsoever that they can hear you. Since the microphone is part of the body that plugs into the cigarette lighter, it's likely a decent distance away from the driver, and all the noise cancellation in the world isn't going to help that tiny little mic pick up anything. This might be a side-effect of the raised seating position in the xB, but that's hardly uncommon with the number of SUVs and minivans on the road. A much better idea would have been a remote mic that you could stick somewhere on the dash, but perhaps Kensington was afraid of liability having extra cords running about the place. If that wasn't bad enough, there's another major problem with audio quality. There simply isn't enough filtering between the input power and the output audio, and the inherently noisy power source leaks through to your stereo. This might not be so bad if there was a ton of signal to swamp it and make it unnoticeable, but because everything's so quiet, signal/noise is abysmal. On my wife's car, I can hear a higher-pitch whine that varies directly with engine speed (this is probably straight from the alternator, but who knows?) plus a bunch of periodic clicks that also vary with rpm. This is plain annoying when playing music, but is cranked up to irritating and beyond during a call - remember, with the stereo turned way up to compenstate for the quiet calls, all that noise just gets louder. Unfortuately, I made the mistake of initially testing the car kit on battery power only before turning it over to my wife, so all I really noticed was the quiet audio. Let me put it this way: my two year-old was asking what all the funny noise was in the car. That's not a good sign, Kensington. Another ominous sign is that I'm not going to even bother rating the quality of the audio delivered over A2DP. Does it sound badly compressed? Who cares? I reached the limit of my patience with the car kit's other audible flaws long before I even started caring about how A2DP sounds. Oops. Another good premise is the little remote that comes with the system. However, this is a waste of time with the iPhone 3GS. The play/pause button does what you'd expect on the iPod side of the phone, and the call button will answer an incoming call when phone rings and will end the a call in progress. However, unlike many Bluetooth devices, the call button has no other function on the iPhone. Additionally, because the call audio is so quiet, I've hung up on a lot of people because I didn't hear anything, so I hit the call button again. Maybe that's for the best as it means I don't have to go through the whole ""Hello?...(hello?)...Hello?...(hello?)"" routine that this car kit seems to induce. A lot of headsets allow you to use voice dialling, etc. if you press and hold the call button. Not so with the iPhone - even though voice control was added in the most recent version of the OS (3.0), this button has no effect on the iPhone when no call is in progress. That's a huge pity, as voice control actually works fairly well. Additionally, the forward/back buttons have no effect on an iPhone. Where the blame for this lies, I'm not sure. I've seen suggestions that although Apple added A2DP to the iPhone, they didn't bother with AVRCP (A/V remote control profile). This would seem to make sense, and unfortunately makes the remote somewhat pointless. I'm also not convinced that the steering wheel is a good place for the remote. Personally, I wouldn't mind mounting it on the stalk for the wipers, but the rubber doohickey that the remote mounts in is obviously sized for a steering wheel and can't be secured to a stalk. I could take the remote out of its mount and stick it somewhere on the dash, but frankly, given this device doesn't actually have a future in my wife's car, I'm not going to bother. As far as I'm concerned, this was money flushed straight down the drain. Thankfully, I'm still within Amazon's return period, so I can offload it that way. Otherwise, I would just have to eat the cost, as I can't in good faith pawn it off on someone through eBay or whatever. It really is just that bad. Either way, it's going to get ripped out of my wife's car. This is the first doodad I think we've ever had that's basically scored a zero on the Wife Acceptance Factor scale, which is impressive, albeit for all the wrong reasons. Ugh.",negative,low,calidad

The phone when first turned on begins in Spanish but automatically switched to English as soon as the network was accessed. The speakerphone is not worthwhile and is only used when absolutely necessary as there is poor voice quality on the other end and the output sound is scratchy and sounds as though the speaker is blown. Another point of frustration I've experienced with the razr is an increase in the voice echo when speaking with other cell phones, although I'm not certain if the fault is the phones or my current networks' issue. Overall, I feel like this phone is a reasonable purchase for 100 dollars for an unlocked phone and I'm satisfied with it.

The basic functionality is that it lets you use your home phone to talk on skype. When you get a skype call, your home phone rings. It works simultaneously with a land line as well. You can have skype and your land line connected at the same time. When you get a skype call your phone will ring differently than when a landline call comes in. It also acts like call waiting. If you're on a skype call and you get a regular call, you'll hear beeps just like call waiting and can flip between the two calls. It works with answering machines too. Incoming calls will ring the same number of times as your landline calls and your answering machine will pick up and they can leave a message just like a regular call. The advanced features are amazing. You can setup the Call Center for skype call forwarding. I have mine set to ring 4 times and if I don't pick up at home, it will use my landline to call my cellphone and connect the skype call. I no longer worry about being at home to take a skype call. The next cool feature is using the Call Center to allow you to make skype calls from any phone on the planet. With this feature enabled, the Call Center will answer your landline phone after a certain number of rings. It can make your PC act like an answering machine. When the greeting comes on, you can type in a secret pin code on the phone and it will then let you dial a skype call and connect you. Picture this: you're at work and have urgent news for your family in another country. Instead of making an international call or going home to make the call, you dial your home phone. The Call Center answering machine on your PC picks up. You punch in your pin and dial your skype speed dial number for your family and the call center connects you. You are now making an international phone call even though you're only paying for the call to your house. When you receive skype calls at home, the skype ID of the person calling will show up on your home phone caller ID. Setup is simple. 1) Install Skype and set it up on your pc 2) Install the software on the CD that came with the Call Center 3) Setup advanced Call Center features on your pc if you want to (it's optional). 4) Connect the Call Center USB cable to your computer 5) Connect your home phone to the Call Center 6) (optional) Connect your landline phone wire to the call Center That's it. You're now in business. Using this box has really improved my life! My parents in europe are not computer savvy and would have NEVER used skype regularly as it is complicated and confusing to them. Now if they want to talk to me, they just pick up the phone and dial ##1. If I want to call them, their phone rings just like normal.

As to the primary functionality, I haven't had problems with calls at all. Navigation is pretty simple. It's sturdy and I like the button for opening it.

2025-08-15T07:54:30.175548Z,"I got this phone based on a recommendation from AT&T :( silly me. I wanted a back up phone my wife could use in case her other phone failed to turn on (also a motorola different model almost 5x price). They recommend this phone because of it's low cost and it's a go phone so you only pay for minutes you use. I bought the phone and loved it. It was very low cost, came with airtime. It feels very solid, except for the battery cover which seems flimsy but seems to hold up with no problems. It had what I felt as good sound quality and a good number of features for such a low cost phone. I wanted to prep the battery since my wife was going to travel soon, so I left it powered on and would constantly press a button so the light would stay on and drain the battery. The display is amazingly bright, I could almost use it as a flashlight. I was also really surprised at the battery life. Anyhow after two cycles of draining the battery and then charging it to full, I figured it would be all set to use as an emergency phone for my wife who was going on a two week business trip. Wrong :( on the last day of her trip her main cell phone battery was low so she decided to try to use the back up phone. It wouldn't turn on :( I don't know if it was due to the xray machines at the airports or what but the battery was drained. She said she never turned it on at all until that day so maybe it got turned on accidently in her purse (phone turns on by pressing a button on the front for 4 or 5 seconds). Anyhow to make matters worse the AT&T rep also said I could also use it as a main phone by transfering the SIM. Nope didn't work either, I was on the older AT&T plan so I had to be migrated.

2025-08-15T07:54:30.241544Z,"I've had Nokia, Sony-Ericsson, and Motorola phones - and each has had features that I found to be incredibly useful. I've heard a lot about Samsung phones in the international community and I was excited when I saw that T-Mobile began offering this phone. I was hoping it would be a combination of all that I ever wanted in a phone - but I was disappointed. To begin with, this phone looks great. Well-built, sturdy, and with a high-gloss finish that screams class it received many compliments every time I brought it out. The screen is bright and delivers detailed images and video. By far, this is the nicest screen I've seen on any portable product - including the iPod Video. It slides open and closes smoothly, and the keypad it reveals is backlit and easy to see in the dark. As an MP3 player, it delivers crisper sound than I heard from my Nokia 6600. The Bluetooth worked flawlessly and instanly hooked up with my other phones and my laptop. The camera is as good as any other cell phone camera that promises 1.3MP. In short, what this phone promised ... it delivered. However, I was disappointed mainly because it appeared that the user interface was not as cleverly designed as the physical package. The phonebook only allows three phone entries per name. Looking up names, you can only search by typing the first letters of the last name. For example, suppose you have an entry for ""John Smith"" - if you use the search feature and type in ""Jo"" it will NOT list all the Johns. You have to search for ""Sm.."". Why? Sure you can sort the phone by either the first or last name, but you can only search using one or the other. Not both. My Nokia and Ericsson could do both. Another phonebook problem - suppose you've just called someone's home and now you want to call their cell. You have to start the search over. It doesn't remember your last search. Headset works fine. But if you have the headset on and the phone rings, you don't hear the ring through the earpiece. The phone rings normally and you activate the call by pressing the button on the headset. That sort of negates the purpose. You can listen to MP3s using the headset, but since the headset uses a proprietary connector, you can't use your ""good"" headphones. Maybe when the phone becomes more popular, adapters to standard headphones will be made. The keys under the screen aren't soft - meaning they cannot be reassigned. The left button opens the menu and the right buttom opens the phonebook. My Nokia let me reassign these keys - so, because I use SMS a lot, I could assign one key to open up the message center. Speaking of keys - the entire keypad is nearly flat. This makes it hard to ""feel"" for a key (while driving for example). I don't have particularly large fingers, but I found myself making a lot of mistakes. Another irritating problem - each menu option has a submenu but the submenus have no relation to one another. (This is a hard one to explain). For example, you are going through your list of audio files. You want to delete one. You click ""Options"" and you get a submenu of seven items. #6 is ""Delete"". You can scroll down, but it is faster to just type in the number 6 as a shortcut. So far so good. Now, you are going through your text messages. You want to delete one. The submenu shows the delete as #7. You want to delete a phonebook entry, the delete is #4 in the submenu. No consistency makes it very hard to use shortcuts. All my prior phones had a dedicated ""Clear"" button that can be used anywhere - but if the people at Samsung don't want to ""waste"" a button, they should've at least made the submenus more consistent. By the way, everytime you delete something it asks you if you want to delete ""All or Selected"" - this is an unnecessary step. You can listen to MP3s, but you can't use them as ringtones unless they are converted to 3gp. This is as easy as changing the extention from .mp3 to .3gp on your computer before uploading the song (via bluetooth or USB). Why the extra step? Battery life is terrible. As expected, using the MP3/video player causes a serious drain on your power. One thing I found weird - after listening to MP3s on the phone during a 1-hour flight, the phone became quite warm. I'm not sure if this will affect the phone's general life-span. The beautiful case looks shiny and great - but it smudges really easily. If you aren't using a headset and you have to press this phone to your ear, be prepared for major smudgeness - especially after a long phone call. Another weird thing - you can only use the supplied charger to charge this phone. Even if you have another Samsung phone, you can't use another phone's charger. All my Nokia phones used the same charger. I ended up returning the phone on the last day of my 14-day trial period. It just didn't deliver what I needed, and the annoyances were just too much for me. I am still waiting for the perfect phone - one that combines the best features of all the other phones. I want the appearance of this Samsung (I love the way it looks and feels), but I want the features in all the other phones. I also want it to use standard plugs.",negative,low,

I had to tell clients to call me on my landline because my cell phone signal was not reliable. I did a lot of research and finally locked into the Wilson DT cell signal booster over all the others. It showed up and I came in over the weekend and ran my own coax from my office to the outside wall (about 40'). I completed the hookup (about 2 hours including mounting, tucking cords, etc.). I checked my phone and the bars did not change. I called Wilson and they walked me through the Gain settings. The Wilson representative asked if I checked my phone and explained to me that since I have 4G, the bars on my phone won't show the boosted change. I was very skeptical. Well, no worries, he was right. The signal works great. It has been over 6 months since I installed the booster and have had no dropped calls. I went from daily dropped calls to zero dropped calls.

2025-08-15T07:54:30.450001Z,"After considerable research, I finally took the plunge and purchased my first smartphone, Motorola's Q Global 9h. I had used a PDA off and on but was disenchanted with docking stations, stylus usage, and carrying both a phone and a PDA. I am extremely pleased with this purchase but bear in mind, I have not owned other brands. Compared to similar offerings, the Motorola Q is much slimmer and lightweight. I was attracted to its functionality, its looks, and its potential to do what I needed done. The voice and sound qualities of the phone exceed my expectations as does the built in camera. I have not yet tried to use the music aspects but that was not important to me in my selection. The full QWERTY keyboard is easy to use compared to others in this class and the interface to the internet is very easy to manipulate. Its voice recognition component has been outstanding so far. The standard battery has been so functional to this point, that I have not even charged the extended battery. Since my corporate system is based on Windows, I needed a Windows Mobile software unit to sync with my corporate requirements. I was amazed with how quickly I was able to sync with my work units, how quick the interface is, and how accessible my emails and corporately based data is now available in my handset wherever I am in the US or world (mostly). All my contacts, my calendar, and all incoming emails appear in my handset within seconds of arriving at my office computer. I especially appreciate the ability to receive my Windows based email from work on my MOTO Q9h but also my email from accounts at AOL and Yahoo. One glance at the screen and I can see email waiting on my Outlook account, my AOL account, a text message, and any voicemails. I assume other smartphones can do this, but it is pretty slick, nonetheless. All in all, this is a great smartphone and I am extremely pleased with it. It is reassuring to know I have the equivalent of everything from an MP3 player to a camera to an internet portal to a video player--all that and a great phone too! After 3 weeks with this device, I unequivocally recommend it those in search of a quality smartphone.",negative,high,calidad|envío

Personally I prefer the clamshell type of phone, but my daughter has moved on to the smartphones. Anyway, at the time these were first put out, they were amazing phones. Very sleek, very useful, tons of features. The only really annoying trait of all of the Moto Razr phones is that the glass is horribly thin and flimsy, and is very easy to break (both inner and outer glass). Good luck finding replacement glass for it - and when you do, expect to pay $15 bucks for it. When you replace the glass, if you don't position it just right, it's easy to break again, because it will be possible to put too much pressure on it. It's not possible to remove it and reposition it, because the glue is so sticky and the glass so thin, that you'll break it just getting it off again. These days you can buy a flip phone with more features for $30 bucks. Yes, I still prefer flip phones. They call them ""throw back"" phones now.

I have two major complaints about this phone. First of all, it's like Windows 95 -- I have to ""reboot"" it every day -- and I don't have any extra software installed other than what comes with the phone. People will frequently tell me they called and got voice mail but my phone did not ring -- when I try to turn on the phone it won't turn on. I have to remove the battery cover and use the stylus to push the reset button. If it's going to lock up that much, at least they should make the reset button more easily accessible. Second, my favorite feature, the voice commands, frequently just doesn't work. When it does work it's incredible -- you push the button on the wired headset and say the right command and you can play music, call any one of your contacts, and I believe you can do other things I haven't tried yet.

2025-08-15T07:54:30.976119Z,"I bought the Jawbone 2 when it came out because it was supposed to be the best headset out there. It wasn't. First of all, the headset would not stay in my ear no matter what, without an ear loop. I don't mind that so much but the ear loops that come with the headset are too short, so the headset has a habit of slipping until it points straight down or falls off. Eventually, I found sound Jabra ear pieces that fixed all my fit-problems and I had a pretty decent experience with the headset since (also, the styling matched my Switcheasy Serpent iPhone case exactly, which was cool). The NoiseAssassin is very effective (provided you don't have a beard... or a very thin beard at most). However, about 9 months in, audio coming out of the headset started sounding distorted and buzzy. It got worse and worse until I set it aside because I couldn't understand people any more, just using the clunky iPhone earbuds instead. Recently, I contacted Jawbone support to see if they had any ideas, explaining that I'd had it since it first came out. First, they had me perform a reset on the headset. When that didn't work, they said they'd replace it. I was actually pretty stoked since I didn't expect that sort of offer. So I gave them my information and faxed them a copy of my receipt (I ordered it directly from them, I should add). It took a week of email tag since they claimed they couldn't open any of the files I emailed to them (including PDF's and even a plain-text file), so I had to fax it from work (who uses faxes any more?). A week later, I get a call from them - saying that my warranty had expired a month prior and they wouldn't replace the headset. What? I was under the impression that they understood I'd had the thing forever (I mentioned it several times in my correspondence). I pointed that out as well as the fact that I wasn't aware the thing had a warranty at all and I was just happy they were going to replace it out of a commitment to good service. Guess not. Instead, I would up being lied to and having my time wasted. It's partially my fault for waiting so long to get a hold of them, but customer service people really shouldn't go making promises they have no intention of keeping. That's absolutely unacceptable. Since I have to buy a brand new headset now, I'm going to go with Logitech, whose products and customer service ALWAYS exceed my expectations. This was my last Jawbone.",negative,high,envío

However the buttons on this thing don't provide good tactile feedback and operating the thing is very difficult. Putting it on your ear is difficult. The proprietary power connector is a pain (what about a mini USB jack) as you need to get more (for use in the office) or carry it around with you. Once you get it working, it works fine; but somebody needs to revisit the industrial design and put some real buttons on this thing that you can tell when they have been punched, and a standard USB jack. Would also be nice to have a mute function (missing). While the technology and specs are good on the Jawbone, the industry design is pleasing but not useable; in-fact I would just conclude that the usability of the product was ignored.

But my phone was still pretty snug in there since the fabric is stretchy, and it doesn't move around at all. The armband is easily adjustable with velcro. It fits around my bicep with plenty of extra room, but I am a small lady without much arm muscle. I find it a bit awkward to insert my phone into the case, it usually takes me a bit to get it in there, especially if I am putting anything else in it (like money or keys). There are two small holes at the top for speakers which work well. The frustrating part about this case is that you are not able to use the phone through the plastic (at least I wasn't on my Droid) and taking your phone in and out of the case on a run is near impossible. Also, sometimes when I put my phone into the case it hits buttons and the volume goes way up or it turns the music off altogether. But that might just be my phone. My boyfriend borrowed the armband the other day and used it with his iPhone. He was somewhat able to use his phone through the plastic cover which was nice. But he had to put the armband on his forearm because it was too tight higher up. But it still worked for him well. The fabric is really nice and breathable. It dries quickly.

I've been using it for several months in a very noisy server room environment. Having gone through multiple supposedly ""noise canceling"" phones, this is the first one that really passed muster with customers. I had been using this on my standard phone line and integrated it with my laptop's Outlook directory. Simple, easy and excellent! Within 5 minutes I had 200 contacts loaded onto the phone. It's nice that you can manually edit the phone numbers and contact information before they're loaded onto the phone so you don't wind up with extraneous data. I just switched over to using VOIP instead of a phone line, and decided to use this with my Mac instead of Windows. Honestly, it's not so good. Unlike other phones that are specifically designed to be VOIP phones, you can't dial the phone through the handset anymore - you have to use the softphone. You can answer and disconnect calls, but that's all. The software for the Mac is not as mature as it is for the PC, either. The Calisto Pro utility for the Mac frequently loses connectivity to the Mac and doesn't show up in the utility bar that it's lost its connection. So, you'll be dialing away through the softphone only to hear your party answering - and you're not audible. It's not a very professional image to present if you're using this for work, as I do. So far, the software for Windows is more reliable. No matter which operating system - once you have a successful connection, sound quality is excellent. The earpiece is very comfortable and the device has wonderful range. I'd like to see Plantronics improve the quality, reliability and feature set of the VOIP offering for this device. Otherwise, it's a pretty expensive wireless USB headset - albeit one with excellent clarity and range.",positive,low,calidad

On Motorola's mistake, they sent me a H715 instead. I didn't immediately notice though but little things were different. The black shade was a little different and then I noticed ""tones"". Tones when I would connect, disconnect, etc. that I did not have with the H710. I like both colors and they both go good with my original iPhone. I think amazon has the best price on both of these... I would highly recommend them. I am currently testing the Plantronics Voyager Pro and notice that it doesn't like my blackberry. It works fine with my original iPhone but the voice quality isn't as great as it was with the H7XX series. I'm returning it and requesting a replacement to see if it was just that one headset. I'm really rooting for the PRO. I find the H7XX series are easier to carry in the pocket as it folds nicely. The PRO feels great and the smallest ear rubber piece works great for my ears. I've had the headset on for hours and using the smallest ear rubber has worked the best. But enough of the Pro. Thank you for your time. UPDATE 01/09/2012 These Motorola H7XX series seem to have about a 10-16 month lifespan. And still I love them. I have used the Motorola warranty right before the 1 year limit and have received either a refurbished or a brand new one which again last about another year or so.

Before I bought the product I climbed on the roof and verified that I had three bars and good call clarity. I fist tried mounting the antenna the peak of the roof line with the base unit in the basement. Didn't seems to work too well. My coax ran within 4"" and perpendicular to a 110V power line, so I repositioned the coax to emlimante this interference with no improvement, sometimes I would get a little better signal but not really a usable signal. So I went out and bought an antenna mount with a 10 foot mast and mounted the antenna at the peak of the roof, I placed the base station in the basement on the floor. This is as much vertical seperation as I can legally have as I am limited in antenna height, this is at least 25 feet of vertical seperation. I still cannot figure out the blinking lights on the base unit after reading the manual several times as they all blink in various patterns pretty much constantly. I don't think there is anything else I can do to improve the installation per the instructions. Now sometimes I get pretty good reception standing by the base unit (3 bars) and about 2 bars on my main floor but other times the system does not appear to be functioning at all. The system seems to be really flakey in the fact that it works sometimes okay but other time not really at all. I have to say I am dissapointed because I spent allot of time trying to get the system installed correctly with poor results and the unit was very expensive without good results, I pretty much feel like I wasted $300.",negative,low,precio

Of course this is standard to all LCDs(read modern screens) verses older VGA(read much better resolution and contrast). I am about to relicense my older LG phone with VGA. Software menu's are much harder to use then older menu layout and software on previous LG's. The absolute worst defect(feature?) is when you receive a call, it is almost impossible to retrieve from your pocket without touching the call interruption button on the outside edge of the phone. This of course disconnects the call and with the crummy screen and you are outside, it is impossible to tell who was calling that you disconnected. This design flaw could be very easily corrected by several means that would take even a full blown idiot about 5 minutes to think up. Possibly requiring 2 rapidly hits to the disconnect button to cut off a call. There are other simple ideas to resolve this problem. This was a problem with my previous LG. You would think that these miscreants that design this stuff would use it in the real world before foisting there newest bright ideas on to the unsuspecting consumer. In other words to see what us chickens are eating out here. I do not like the way the square edge of the earpiece fits my ear. The more rounded oval type edges are far better for getting audio into the ear canal. As noted by others, the keyboard sucks. Would be nice if some commonly used keys were color coded so that in daylight when keys(they are flat and very reflective) are hard to see, they would be more user friendly. Do like the slimline of the phone and its high tech look. Only reason that I upgraded(?) phone was to gain bluetooth but am finding that my older phone was far more ergonomically user friendly.

2025-08-15T07:54:31.954437Z,"This was my first bluetooth headset purchase and after only 2 weeks I just made my second bluetooth headset purchase. I read lots of reviews on amazon and cnet and the Blue Ant Z9i is the only one that I came across with a 5 star rating. That was 2 weeks ago and I see it's now down to a 4 star rating. I have no complaints about the audio quality. I'm hearing impaired and wear hearing aids so I do need to take 1 of the hearing aids out to use the headset but I was still able to understand conversations crystal clear on the other end. I encountered some statis a few times but when I moved around a bit that seemed to disappear. I asked several people on the other end how my voice sounded and they all said it was fine. So no complaints about the audio. The fit however, is another story. Once the headset was in my ear for a few seconds with the ear hook on it was ok and I didn't really notice too much that it was in. But getting it into my ear wasn't a smooth process. Either I have very smell openings on my ears or the ear bud is on the large side. I did manage to get it in and for the most part it was comfortable enough that I wouldn't complain about it. But if I had to rate it on it's fit I would not give it 5 stars. the ear hook was an issue from day one. Because I wear hearing aids I switched back and forth each day between my left and right ears so that my hearing aid batteries drained evenly. The first time I switched the postion of the ear hook it came detached from the unit and although I was able to get it on well enough to stay on my ear, I knew it wasn't as secure as it could or should be. I was constantly checking to make sure it was still sitting on my ear properly. I think they could've done a much betterjob designing a sturdier ear hook. I'm also visually impaired and can't really see the display all that well so the only functions I used were turning the powere on + off, always checking to make sure the up volume button was as high as it goes, and pressing the MFB to use voice activation to dial calls. I can't comment on the other features such as call waitinig, muting, etc because I didn't use them. I just ordered a replacement bluetooth headset and went with the Motorola H700 this time. The ear hook seems to be better constructed and I think I'll like it better just touching my ear rather than jamming a too big earbud into my ear. My hearing aids that go into my ears are nowhere near as big as this headset. If the earhook and earbud aren't issues for you you'll like this headset just fine.",neutral,low,calidad

Most people tell me that they hear me good, but I hear them like a Thomas Edison's Tin Can. 5. Static, Static! Mostly due to the extremely short range of headset.

I will still try Plantronics but a higher ""value"" headset -- 340 is junk. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- FYI I tried it with my PC (Class-1 adapter).... Range is solid to about 10ft. Good to listen to MP3 from PC... nonetheless I get only static when I try to record my voice from the Headset even thought I am next to the BT adapter.

2025-08-15T07:54:32.177052Z,"Great product over all! With the replaceable foam in-ear buds you get the best bass frequencies that this product can produce! (Downside, with any headphones for that matter: Awareness of your surroundings are severely impaired and reduced to only hearing loud noises, use regular in-ear buds for sketchy areas of travel) As noted, the stereo cable breaks very easily on the hook, at the connecting joints, and there are ***NO MORE REPLACEMENTS IN PRODUCTION***. The replacement stereo cable has been discontinued indefinitely, as well as this product. The only replacements I could find are second generation found only on Ebay.com and in my opinion, look horrible connected to such a sophisticated and elegant device. I am not even sure how I broke the stereo cable but if I were to guess, I sat on them. I just took them out of my side leg pocket after I sat down on the train/rail/subway and they were broken. After months of trying to find the actual replacement stereo cable, I bought an entirely new unit and don't intend on having it leave the house too often. I am also getting a cheap side holster / waist case for it when it does leave the house, no more pockets for this beautiful Bluetooth stereo headset / headphones. (I also purchased the Sony Ericsson HBH-IS800 Stereo Bluetooth Headset for outside the house music listening, they still look awesome, cheaper, much smaller, less bulky, still Bluetooth, and look much less likely to break).

2025-08-15T07:54:32.212324Z,"The E51 is sleek, built for style and productivity...a rare combination that means popularity with true merit. So I'm quite puzzled that this phone isn't being pushed as much as the N95. It's got the right dimensions, not too heavy in the shirt pocket, feels good in my hand, the keypad has excellent touch and layout with 1-press keys for Calendar, Contacts, Email, Bluetooth (on/off) and Silent/General mode. It's real cool that the 1-press keys for Calendar, Contacts and Email have different modes. Short press starts the app (Calendar, Contacts, Email). Long press starts a new record within the app (new calendar entry, new contact, new message). I've re-assigned the 1-press key for Email to start the Messaging app, and long press starts the CryptoGraf Messaging app to encrypt my messages. There's WLAN internet access with a proper browser. The camera, with just 2 MegaPixels, is good enough for my needs. The screen is crystal clear and good for viewing video and images. BTW, I thought it gets scratched quite easily, but that's just the plastic screen protector. I removed the screen protector and the screen stays scratch free even after I put the phone in my trouser pocket along with my keys. Another feature that makes the upgrade from E50 to this E51 a great idea...there's a font setting for adjusting the menu font sizes to Large, Medium, Small. Voice call quality is quite good. The speakers are also quite good but they're awkwardly located on the back. The volume controls on the side of the phone are not easy to use...it's quite confusing that the 'cursor key' acts as a volume control for the media player, but the voice call volume control is on the side of the phone. The CPU is very fast at 350MHz, Bluetooth 2.0+EDR, Mini USB 2.0, 2.5 mm A/V connector.

2025-08-15T07:54:32.432128Z,"I've had my T-Mobile Sidekick II (produced by Danger, Inc for Sharp) since December 2004. I got one because my pal Leo Laporte got one. We seem to trade tech fetish material back and forth, he convinced me to buy a Sidekick just by talking about it, I came on his show to pimp the Playstation Portable (more on that in another article). It's a fun little game we play. Now, let me preface this article by saying that I really really despise PDAs. I used to have a Palm III, IIIe, and IIIc back from 1999-2000. I may have hated them because I had no life to organize, but I came away from the PDA fad revolution thinking they were an utter waste of time. I still do today, and PDAs seem to be getting even more expensive by the day and don't do what a person needs them to. There are many types of cell phones that have tried this formula and failed, and many successful ones which are not as tactile as this phone (the Blackberry, Treo 600 and Treo 650 for instance). There are also insanely expensive phones like the Sony-Ericsson P900 which are basically just a Palm unit in a phone (aka a ""smart"" phone)... who the hell wants to use a stylus to pick a telephone call up? I'd like to meet `em. The Sidekick is a totally different beast. It's essentially a kinda-chunky cell phone combined with a few communication utilities that people actually use and a 640480 integrated digital camera. There is an AIM client built in, a Yahoo Messenger client that is downloadable free inside the unit, a semi-full-featured POP-compatible e-mail client, a web browser, and my killer app, the $10 downloadable SSH Terminal client. It also has a few things I don't use like a basic scheduler and to-do list. I can't say there's a feature other than the last two I listed that I don't use on this phone. It's a marvel of engineering and a phone that clearly was designed by geeks (the calculator app says `31337&#8242; on the application icon's display), but is also insanely user friendly and every button on the unit does what you'd think it would do in applications on the phone. The sidekick uses some form of java to serve up it's programs and is decently fast. Certainly not breaking any speed records but it does what it needs to do. The AOL Instant Messenger client gets a LOT of use by me, I always have this on when I'm walking around, and the implementation of this on the phone is insanely good. It's almost as tactile to use as AIM on a laptop and typing to others using the qwerty keyboard is so fast most of my friends do not even realize they're talking to me on it while I'm driving 70 miles per hour down the highway going somewhere. The second most used feature is definitely the Sidekick's built in 640480 camera. It is pretty terrible in low light situations (sometimes I have to hold the camera steady for up to 5 seconds to get it to ""adjust"" to the light so you can even see anything), however I still use it very often and having it nearby has become an almost invaluable resource for documenting strange things I see everywhere. Once the photo is taken the built in mail program on the sidekick can send it to any email address you can think of in seconds. I absolutely love this feature. The mail client on the Sidekick is very impressive. You can have up to 4 email addresses active, in addition to the provided @tmail.com address you get with the phone. The phone fully supports POP email as well and grabs new mail from T-Mobile's server in a sort of ""push"" fashion every 15 or 30 minutes (I am not sure on the exact interval). Pictures can be viewed and sent in email, and you can tell it to strip attachments of different types to save on phone memory, which comes in very handy since the unit only has 6MB of storage space to store mail in. I am not sure why they skimped in this department, but they made tools to keep it easy to manage the mail coming in, such as an auto-delete after X days feature to keep you below your 6MB memory limit. Contacts pop up based on the email address you filled into their phone book entry in your phone and it supports fuzzy searches of a few letters allowing you to scroll and quickly select the person you were looking for to add to the email list. The web browser on the sidekick leaves a little to be desired. It does not support JavaScript and has a bit of difficulty with frames, and with images turned on some sites don't load at all or load insanely slow. I turned images off on my sidekick to speed up browsing since I usually use it to find phone numbers or addresses anyway. It is fast enough now with the images turned off on the web browser but I hope by the time the Sidekick 3 rolls around there will be faster data networks in place and better software. One of the features that does not come on the Sidekick by default is the Terminal program. Useful only to real geeks and unix/linux nerds, this feature allows you to remotely control any unix based machine via a secure shell. I use this currently to SSH into a linux machine I have sitting at home that has irssi on it (a popular command line irc client) - so I can use IRC from the road. I take credit for discovering this feature myself and turning Leo on to it. Dan 1, Leo 0 :) . This is just a killer app for any nerd who wants to chat anywhere, anytime. Boring movie or dinner? Just whip this out and talk to people who aren't boring to you. Other than those three features, some neat features the Sidekick has are: - Reflective TFT screen: Even in broad sunlight the LCD is easy to read, an essential thing for using this outside. The sun reflects off the LCD making it even brighter than the built in backlight. - Flip up screen with qwerty keyboard / scroller: Both are a godsend. The scroll wheel is very intuitive also. - Picture Phone Book Entries: you can snap a photo of your friend and attach it to their phonebook entry, so every time they call you see their ugly face grinning at you. - Ability to view JPG, GIF, PDF and WAV files: Hallelujah! Picture format support is excellent for a device like this. You can also play WAV files... I've been told you can assign WAV files to ring tones but haven't bothered with it yet. - Games: Many many downloadable games for this including a version of Snake called Snake DX. The standard cell phone fare, not very good graphics but sorta fun. Here's my summary of this unit. Pros: + Excellent Mail, AIM, and Terminal programs + Excellent screen for the size + Insanely well designed user interface! Both hardware and software! + Flip-out hidden QWERTY keyboard is amazing. + Only has the stuff you need and nothing else + Nationwide AIM and IRC! I'm in heaven! Cons: - Battery only lasts about 1.5 days - Slightly bulky (didn't bother me much) - Web browser is slow with images turned on - Camera has poor low light performance - No bluetooth support - High price (around $300) if you don't buy it with a plan, but who cares! My final call: Buy this thing if you possibly can! It is $20/mo on top of your existing T-mobile plan for unlimited data, or $25/mo if you do not want phone service.

If it is recommeded that you put it outdoors, don't you think that they would include it or tell you at time of purchase that this kit is needed? The other problem is again associated with outdoor installation. They give you ab. 30 feet of coaxial cable which is great. The problem is that BOTH ends are finished with the crimped attachment hardware....try getting THAT through the existing cable hole to the outside. So, another trip to the hardware store 17 miles one way to get a crimping tool and masonry bits and screws to PROPERLY attach the mounting hardware for the signal atenna on the OUTSIDE brick.

2025-08-15T07:54:32.591523Z,"After losing my last Plantronics 510 to a ""dog incident"", I picked up another 510, a Motorola H710 and a Jabra BT8040 and put them to the test head-to-head. I use a Uniden cordless land-line phone that can pair with a BT headset, and a Palm Centro smartphone. All three of these phones support multipoint. The H710 failed to cancel echo (my voice played back to me delayed) on the Uniden phone, and the BT8040 would not pair with the Uniden at all. All three worked well with the Centro. All three headsets had very good audio quality in quiet environments. The 510 was best in noisy and windy environments. The H710 had the loudest volume and was easiest to hear callers. The BT8040 in extremely loud environments would apparently get confused in its echo cancellation algorithms and tend to experience audio cutouts (for the wearer, not the caller). The H710 has the best ""user interface"". Love how flipping the little boom mike open and closed turns on and off the headset. It's audio prompts are intuitive and pleasant. The BT8040 and H710 both have good button/LED usage designs. The BT8040 requires a 3-5 second button press to turn the phone on and off -- otherwise it is the user interface equal to the H710. In comparison, the 510 has a less polished interface. The power button is hard to use, and it constantly flashes a blue light when on, which grabs the attention of those around you -- a feature that I find quite annoying. The interface of the BT8040 is just as good, with the exception that on and off requires a 3-5 second button press -- less elegant than the H710's approach. The 510 has a big flaw in its user interface: a blue light flashes all the time it is on. Combined with its large size, the 510 annoyingly draws the attention of those around you. Pocketability is a big concern for me. The 510 isn't really pocketable. I never broke one in 3 years, but then almost never put it in my pocket for fear of breaking it. The H710 when off is nearly a sphere and is easily pocketable. The BT8040 is a micro-sized ""brick"" in shape, smaller than the H710 and about equally pocketable. Headset fit is another bit concern. The 510 is the most comfortable for me. The BT8040 is second, which surprised me. The H710's hard ear-loop rubs on my ear in one spot and pretty quickly becomes uncomfortable. The 510 isn't amenable to glasses, but the other two are. All of the headsets are secure. The 510 fits well as a result of its design. The BT8040 fits well, in part because it is so very small and light. The H710 'hangs' and 'flaps' against the ear, is the least secure of all three, but didn't ever fall off when I was testing it. Battery life is good on all units. I don't talk enough to give them a hard workout in this regard. However, the 510 seems to take the longest to charge, the BT8040 the fastest, and the H710 in the middle. I found the H710 to be the worst of the three. It's performance in noisy conditions doesn't compare well to the others. It's fit is the worst, at least on my ear. The H710 is definitely the loudest of the three, which could be a boon for many headset wearers. Just don't plan on using it in very noisy situations.",positive,low,calidad

2025-08-15T07:54:32.614060Z,"I had this phone for two days before trading it in for a cheaper, sturdier phone. I was absolutely in love with the features but in the end the actual hardware convinced me to return it. The good: It comes with windows mobile 6, which includes windows explorer, word, excel and powerpoint (read and edit). It also has a sharp 2.0 megapixel camera and a decent video recorder. My favorite feature was the touch screen which responded well to my fingers as well as the included stylus. It has handwriting recognition and virtual keyboard for input. You can press the talk button to bring up a virtual keypad, and in general I found it quite easy to make phone calls. I only used the wifi card with the internet and found it to be pretty fast, although browsing the web tends to drain the battery. Even so, you can get a good two days use out of it if you remember to turn the wireless card off when not using it, otherwise it'll constantly be searching the area and will empty the battery in hours. Also, as others have said, the phone has a very nice soft rubbery feel to it. It's also a very pretty phone with rich colors. The bad: I almost never used the slide out keyboard because it's very flat and has a slippery plastic feel. Also there was a delay when you slid it out when the phone tries to reorient itself. In general the phone is a little slow, due to its 201 MHz processor, and you'll have to constantly close out programs in order to keep in running smoothly. When the keyboard is closed, it doesn't lock in, so that it's always wiggling around. This is especially annoying when you're on the phone for a while. It also comes with very little memory. With all the programs, you won't have enough room in the internal memory for even one song, so purchasing extra memory is a must. The phone is also quite bulky and fragile, so you'll be paranoid about dropping it. In the end I was sad to return it because it's got some really amazing features, but I just couldn't justify the price with all the flaws.",negative,low,precio

Changeable faceplates gives the phone a customizable touch. Ring tones sound a bit fuzzy with the phone open it seems but when shut sound fine. A very odd variety of ring tones as well.

The outbound audio is tinny and sometimes distorted. The earpieces designed to rest in the ear canal have been designed with too much tolerance in their interface with the base unit so when you twist them on, they easily fall off. This makes putting the device on your ear an extreme challenge. I finally had to use a small amount of adhesive to bond the earpiece to the device so it would not fall off every time I put in on my ear.

2025-08-15T08:16:39.570977Z,"This is possibly the best bluetooth I have ever owned. It can function as a standalone headset while still playing wireless audio or you can add the attachment for wireless stereo music. It comes with multiple ear attachments to fit different exterior ear shapes and interior ear sizes. Very durable which is what really amazes me. I inadvertantly dropped this thing in the middle of a snow storm at my home and thought, ""Oh, crap. I just lost $80."" I waited a moth later and I found the head set after the snow melted. I charged it, used it, and it worked just like new! I was amazed at this little things hardiness considering it also takes daily beatings from my 1 and 3 year old. The sound quality is excellent and does not receive much interfernce like others I have used. If my bluetooth music skips it usually isbecause the cellular radio on my phone is on which interfers on most any cell phone, so if it is off it plays flawlessly. It works well at a distance up to the advertised 30 feet and syncs nicely to my PC. It has the AD2P functionality with I believe 2.1 BT firmware. It stays nicely in your ear so you can hear your audience well and does not move much if fitted properly to your ear, even when running though I would not recommend it for jogging. I wish this used a normal USB mini charger but if that is the only fault that is pretty good. As for the buttons and media functions like voice dialing and pause/play/next the headset works very well although not as well on Android phones. By this I mean that sometime you need it hit buttons twice to make it work and sometimes the audio does not pick up on command but call quality and music quality are very good. Windows Mobile phones work flawlessly with it as I'm sure Blackberrys and other smart phone would. I will note the first one I got (which I admit was used) worked terribly after a month, but you pay for what you get which is especially true with bluetooth headsets. I have seen others go as high as $200 and yet this one works well for an average pricing.

2025-08-15T08:16:39.603162Z,"UPDATED Feb 9th 2008: Well the BT5020 is now dead, I'm sending it back to jabra and we will see from there what happens. Following my initial review I returned the unit for replacement once and that fixed some of the sound issues, not all of them but enough that I was acceptably pleased. Over the 6 months I found the unit to be functional and seldom did it offer me reason to complain, the sound was clear and I could be heard without many ever offering complaint, unless I was outdoors in a wind, but I think some aspects are to be understood and tolerated. I will note though, using the dual connection capability was nice, but glitchy, especially when hooked to a nextel and using direct connect, then things truly got fouled up and generally connections were lost to the phones and often calls. Over all I won't lower or raise my review on this unit, it worked when it worked and while far from stellar, I think for 30 bucks it was acceptable. ________________________________________________________________ I'm new to the BT ear piece market, this being my second in the past few months. My first was/is the Jabra BT500, which is very enjoyed... once I got used to tolerating the eargel discomfort, and no adjustability for fit. So my hopes were high with the BT5020, in getting rid of the eargels and allowing for some angle and length of speaker position, would fix my comfort levels. So my first impressions of the BT5020 was wow, this is comfortable, it weighs less, no eargel and the size is very balanced with the over all package. Turned on the power and it started in pair mode, and paired without a glitch or bump with my Sanyo 8400. So far so good, I was working in the yard, so decided to leave it on and see how I liked the fit and feel. And to speak straight, I forgot I had it on and got the sudden reminder of it real quick when my wife called, the vibrate alert went off (I'd forgotten it had vibrate alert) and I nearly came unglued tell I recalled what was doing it. This thing is that comfortable, no feeling like my ear is plugged up, no strange pulling or pushing, or slippage to keep telling me I have something on/in my ear. The phone call however set off the first warning signs, there was very distinct static and crackling, this with my phone on my hip on the same side as the earpiece. I kept it in mind but kept working for a few hours before deciding to go and really play with my new earpiece. I started conducting some tests around the house, called customer service of my phone company, and figured to kill two birds with one stone. I had the phone on a shelf at the same level as my ear, about 3 feet away. The static wasn't noticed this time so I began moving around the room and it returned. After 9-12 feet distance, the static was so bothersome that if the CSR had answered, I'd not have been able to conduct business. I tried moving it closer and at different angles with varying results and little improvement. Static wasn't noticed as a background noise or white noise type, but direct distortion of voice and or background music (I was on hold a while), it changed with the volume/beat of the sound I was supposed to be hearing clearly. To say the least, right now I'm not pleased; I truly like the feel, fit, weight and appearance of this headset. There is a notable creak from the flexible portion but nothing I will notice after a few days of using something. The button position for those used to the BT500, as I am, is a little different as it is a bit harder to tap the answer/end button, for you can't really just pinch the end of the mic area and catch the button, as you can with the BT500, but those are small things and a few days of playing will pan out if they become larger issues. I've worn wired headsets for years, mostly Plantronic or Jabra versions'; so moving to BT has been a learning experience. I'm not going to give up on the BT5020 just yet, I'm going to further test it over the weekend, at work where I'll have multiple other phones and radios on or around my person, at times talking on various radios of various frequencies.

Pushing the Call button will automatically dial the last person called, while holding the same button down for 2-3 seconds then releasing it will allow you to use voice commands, and the same button held down for just a little longer will shut the unit off. This may cause issues if you keep calling the same number or can't figure out why the voice command feature isn't coming up because you weren't paying attention to the length of time you pressed the call button. If patience (or timing) is not one of your virtues I would look for something that automatically triggers the voice command feature rather than last number called and has a separate on/off switch.",neutral,low,

2025-08-15T08:16:39.637514Z,"I should start by saying this is my first Bluetooth device, so I was pleased at how easily this paired to my phone (Samsung Galaxy S -- another reviewer complained that Samsung didn't allow third-party device pairing, which obviously is no longer true) following the instruction manual (whose usefulness sadly sort of ends there). I should also say I didn't pay full retail but rather bought through a Hong Kong eBay seller -- waited an eternity for shipping but got a real bargain, especially considering the device is far from perfect and not exactly worth full price. First and foremost, battery life. The description promises 8 hours? After two full charging cycles, I'm lucky to squeeze 3-1/2 to 4 out of it. Maybe that will improve over time, but doubling? I'm skeptical. Of course, it seems to give another hour or more of use after the low battery starts alarming, the problem is that's with an audible chime every 30 seconds or so that interrupts your music and is impossible to ignore. There's nothing in the manual about disabling this so I doubt it's possible. Second, the play/pause and rewind buttons are a bit hit-or-miss. Not a dealbreaker, but I would have felt a little shafted if I had paid full retail. I was a tad disappointed in the range. I had hoped to use this while working nights at a vet hospital, but concrete walls proved too great an obstacle. Works well with the phone in the room with me though. Those are my only complaints really. The volume is great, even a little too loud at times. The hands-free works well and my callers say I sound fine. I like keeping this tucked under my shirt while biking and eliminating the obtrusive headphone wire extending all the way to my handlebars, and I can correctly hit the buttons through my shirt about 90% of the time thanks to the ridged edges. I especially love that I set this up with my Tasker app so just connecting the BT automatically launches my bike computer app, turns on GPS, maximizes my screen brightness and media volume, and disables screen timeout*. In short, a cool little toy but don't settle for full retail price. 2-week update: It seems like the battery life is getting worse rather than better. Occasionally will get a ""bum connection"" where music stutters or puts weird choppy cuts in that screw up the beat, fixed by unpairing and re-pairing. With these shortcomings, I think they really have some stones asking such a high retail price for this thing. *This might be more of an endorsement for Tasker.",positive,low,precio|envío

The default volume setting is very low and the volume control doesn't seem to do anything except making beeps in my ear. I's only been couple hours since I had this headset and it's most definitely going straight back to the store I bought it from.

Problem is, if you take advantage of all the iPhone features (especially video streaming, or heavy photography) you can run through electrons pretty quickly. I previously used a Battery Case extender which is manufactured by a popular company, and really had no problems with it. The big ""but"" is, I'm an active guy; gym, running, and hiking. Most of the battery style cases don't offer much in the way of protection from moisture either from sweat, or the unanticipated rain shower while outside. I obtained an Otterbox Defender case, which I have found provides the best all around protection from both drops, scratches, and also moisture. Moving the phone between the two became a huge hassle just to get the phone charged up, and also I lost moisture protection when using the battery case. Enter the New Trent IMP500, which I found on Amazon.com and was intrigued by the large capacity given its' size. I purchased one, and also a Griffin coiled USB to 30pin Apple sync cable. I carry the IMP500 and coiled cord in a discreet runner's belt under my shirt which keeps it close at hand without committing the dreaded Fanny Pack fashion faux pas. The IMP500 comes with an retractable USB charging cable, with mini-USB and micro-USB adapters. This cable can be used both for charging the unit, or in reverse for powering any device utilizing a micro or mini-USB port (virtually all non-Apple wireless phones). I can plug in my Bluetooth headset when the unit isn't needed to power my iPhone. The construction seems sturdy, and the corners are rounded so that it can be carried close to the body, or in a pocket without generating discomfort. It features an on/off switch, and also a row of LEDs to indicate the unit's state of charge. At 5000mAh rating, it should provide several recharges to the iPhone without needed juice itself. I now have no hesitation at going on an overnight hike, and even using the iPhone GPS unit for navigation as I know I have a couple recharges left. As time passes, I hope I will be able to report more on the durability of the unit and also how well the battery retains it's rechargeability and life.",positive,low,

A friend of mine is travelling in a remote part of Asia now with a new 7290 and he is giving it a big thumbs up. Not much to complain about. The older larger 6710 fit my hand better but such is life.

Sure, any writer is proud to be asked for his take, but how could I adequately review a regulatory cost recovery fee? I mean, nobody likes to pay fees. But this fee in particular is perhaps not as bad as the rest. You see, I'm one of those rare people who thinks regulations are a good idea. Especially utility regulations. Anyone who lived in California while Enron was bleeding electrical customers dry probably agrees that regulation is ultimately best. And this is the weird problem with cell phones: generally you aren't charged for long distance, hence the taxes usually charged for long distance can't be charged. The government was forced to put a fee on cell phone service. Now I know many of you are against taxes; I don't like paying taxes either. But ultimately, taxes and fees pay for a lot of things we take for granted, like utility regulations that keep our phone companies from bleeding us dry (for now). Frankly, I wish that most taxes and fees (especially payroll taxes) in favor of a steep progressive income tax that primarily taxed the wealthy, along with an estate tax that forced every American to start on a level playing field. Now THAT would be equal opportunity. But under our current tax system, this fee isn't so bad. Three stars out of five seems about right, although I hope the government starts regulating these insane text message rip-offs soon.

2025-08-15T08:16:40.405533Z,"This product is a mixed success in comfort. The band is comfortable on your neck, but the ear occluding earpieces are not as comfortable. As normal, the Motorola brand Bluetooth link works very well and the battery life is good. However, there are 2 problems - the earpieces suffer from the ""occlusion effect"", and 2 the stiff wires have bad touch noise. The ""occlusion effect"" is how your own voice sounds in your ears when you stick your fingers in your ear - you hear your own voice loudly, hear yourself swallow, and can even hear yourself breathe. The occlusion effect is undesirable in quiet environments and particularly if you are eating chips! Additionally, having the ear canal occluded makes the earpieces VERY sensitive to touch noise - touching the earpiece or when the stiff wire brushes against your collar produces a medium loudness scratchy noise in your ear. I understand why an occluded earpiece was used - because it can deliver great bass with extremely low power from the internal audio amplifier - but the occluded earpiece is annoying for long duration wear compared to buds that just sit in the bowl of your ear. It is possible to reduce the occlusion effect partly at the expense of bass and sound isolation by putting a hole the size of a pencil tip in the rubber earseal to allow it to vent to the outside. This is particularly useful if your intention is to listen to audio books.",negative,low,

I had to take the spring out and adjust it so it would work. But it only lasted for a few weeks before the clip was loose again. This model (for the Black Berry Curve 8330) has the ability to swivel (which apparently all of their holsters do, I am told). Again, after nine months or so of use the holster will swivel much too easily. I don't like the ability of the holster to swivel so I fixed that with some screws. I used a screw to fix the clip as well. Customer service from Otter Box is certainly lacking. I contacted them with the following message: Hi. I purchased my Otter Box Defender on May 24, 2009 from Amazon.com LLC. Recently, the belt clip that rotates on the holster is so loose that it rotates on my belt too easily. The spring on the clip itself is so weak that I have had my phone drop off of my belt and land on the floor. Is there any way to replace the rotating belt clip? I love my Otter Box and the protection it gives my phone. I don't want to give it up for something with less protection but has better components. Thank you. The following was the only response received: Update for Case #93443 - ""Holster clip"" If you send me your name address and phone type that we are carrying. Thanks, [name of customer service rep] I don't know what they were going to do to resolve this. I thought that by asking for my name and address they would have sent me another holster.

Again, the pod's slim design makes it great because it takes up very little space and I don't have to fumble with cables. The only thing I wish this pod did was allow for synching and data transfers. I don't transfer data to my BlackBerry very often, so I am constantly forgetting to unplug the cable from the pod and move it to the data port (mini USB port) on my BlackBerry Pearl 8100.

As I plugged in my earpiece to charge via the company supplied USB cable connected to my computer, I walked away and started to notice a burning smell. As I looked around to find the source, I saw smoke coming from my earpiece. The connection from the earpiece to the charging cable had melted. I unplugged the cable from my computer and moved the earpiece into the garage in case the battery was on fire and could explode. I then called Jawbone to let them know of the situation and if there was a service department that I could send the earpiece to for trouble shooting. The person on the other end of the phone told me that the charger was not meant to be used with a computer, really? 1: The user manual states: You can charge your Jawbone headset via the wall charger, or via USB on your computer. It shows a couple pics, one of the wall plug and one of the computer with nice little arrows pointing where you can plug it in. I know the spiel, give the company memo so as to lay blame on the consumer, great motto, profit over people. Works on the uneducated and those who are ignorant enough to believe you have their best interests in mind. I then explained I wasn't looking for a replacement as it's a few years old, I just wanted to send it in so they could identify the problem, nope, not something they deal with. So long story short, Jawbone won't correct problems in their products. The fire could have been caused by faulty connections in either the headset or charger, bad soldering, cheap wiring, but hey, why would they want to know that? Maybe because these could be components still in use by your company and you might, you know, want to fix something that can cost someone their home or their life? Jawbone makes a great product, no doubt, but without a hint of integrity and a profit over people corporate attitude, I won't be buying their products ever again.",negative,low,

I opened the little bugger up and noticed that the only connection to the battery is through a small, metal cage which sits upon the charger. This is connected to the main body on one side and not very well. The single point of connection had been severed due to the simple swing of the power cord! I don't recommend this product. If you are looking for a GPS, please consider one of the products that has a much stronger power connection. While this one should last the warranty, it will likely break soon after with limited usage.

With one phone call (in which I was stationary) the sound quality was slightly but distinctly poorer than what I am used to with my wired headset; at least the conversation didn't seem to suffer, so I thought this was okay. However, the second time I used the headset, this time on the road, the person I was speaking to complained that he could not hear me well and asked if I was using a different headset or something. This was simply unacceptable. Under the same conditions, using my trusty old wired Plantronics M214C Headset, I never have any complaints and people tell me I sound best / clearest when I use it (the old, wired, Plantronics M214C Headset). To me, Bluetooth isn't worth it unless/until it can match or surpass a wired headset in reliable sound quality. It's that simple. I don't like getting tangled in the wires, and I've been frustrated with headset jacks that suffer from wear (and now I have to contend with an adapter to mini-USB in addition) but, ultimately, it's about hearing the other person on the line and having them be able to hear you, too.",negative,low,calidad

Messing with the ""coat hanger"" ear piece does nothing to help with volume. I emailed Cardo and they said there are no other ear buds/pieces for this unit.

I then moved on to the Moto H710 which I found almost a prefect product of your ear was 1/2 sized.

I thought it was the best looking one of the phones they offer, because I like phones small and thin and I also like them to have a good quality camera. They offer some phones with just a VGA quality camera but this one has a 1.3 megapixels camera. I'll keep this review short and just list the good and bad points about the phone. GOOD: * small * thin * you can watch cable TV channels, some LIVE, and some included free with the pictures pack. I watch CNN, FOX News, E!, etc. You can even watch The Disney Channel live and use video on demand to choose a certain episode of the show to watch from a list of episodes. This is a good feature for long car trips or bus trips if you get bored. BAD: * It is hard to hang up. You have to hit the end button 2 or 3 times to disconnect. * When watching TV you better have headphones because the sound is loud and if you hit the down button it goes mute. I had to cover the speaker on the back with my thumb just so I could hear without it blasting thru my whole office. * If you want to use headphones good luck because there is no headphone jack. You have to buy a separate mini-USB to headphone jack adapter. And you'll need one kind if you want to listen to TV or music (the stereo kind) and one kind if you want to use a phone headset (the mono kind). * They put the volume, camera, and ""action"" button on the flip part of the phone, so when you go to flip open the phone you hit these buttons with your fingers. I've accidentally disconnected people before just trying to get the phone open. On the left side of the phone you have just one inch of free space to open the phone. So you have to be very careful opening it so you don't hit any of these buttons. * No address book searching as another reviewer mentioned. You can filter by ""friends"", ""family"", etc. but theres no search feature. Happy scrolling! * Very hard to get to the mini SD card. * Front screen is black when not in use so you can't see the time unless you press a button or open the phone.

Just need to get a pre-paid SIM chip locally. - Can be charged from laptop using included USB cable. - It's BLACK. THE OK ====== - Passable voice quality.

Great ringtone sounds. Though these are pretty standard nowadays. - Decent bluetooth range. Paired this with a Jabra BT800 headset and I can run into the coin laundry with my ear piece and still connect with the phone in the car outside. THE BAD ======= - Short battery life. 7 hours talk-time as advertised is a imaginary. Phone starts to beep after 2-3 hrs of talking. - Organizer (calendar, alarm, notes, contacts) doesn't sync correctly with Outlook. - Oily screens!! The inside and outside screens and the metallic keypad get oily fingerprints after every use (is it just my skin?!) Looks yucky and kinda destroys all the aesthetics. Tried wiping now and then but notice minor scratches start to accumulate. (My clothes are not always cotton and I don't usually carry eye glass cloth.) - Low camera resolution.

The problem is that the Treo 600 is the most fragile phone I've ever encountered. A drop from even 12"" will break the display, which isn't replacable or covered by the warantee. Your only solution: buy a new phone. Sprint are amazingly unhelpful here. They are more than happy to sell you a new replacement phone to fulfill your contract ($600), but that's it. If you press them, Sprint will sell you a ""cheap"" phone to continue your contract for only $150, but they will not repair a Treo 600. Moving on to coverage, I found that in the San Jose area, Sprint had lousy coverage. When pressed, Sprint will insist that there are new towers coming on line every day, but over the course of a year I only saw the signal strength get worse. If you must buy the Sprint version of the Treo 600, BUY THE INSURANCE. Over the course of a two-year contract, you will replace the phone at least once. Ask youself this: would you rather pay $5 a month for insurance, $600 to replace a broken phone, or $150 to buy out your contract and start over with a new carrier? Bottom line: the Treo 600 is a great phone if you're willing to treat it like it's made of glass. When it breaks, you'll have to deal with Sprint's abysmal customer service. If Palm can solve their manufacturing problems, they'll have a winner. Until then, but the insurance and the best protective case you can find.",negative,high,precio|calidad

2025-08-15T08:16:42.505751Z,"A lot of people are complaining about this headset. I share some of their views, but this is still a good headset. Sadly, I may have to stop using it and search for another. I have had a few bluetooth headsets in the past, and have had trouble hearing with all of them. I would love to use a headset like the Motorola H700 (my wife uses that one and loves it). BUT, those headsets are not very adjustable. I have large ears--and when wearing headsets like the H700, the speaker is a good 1/2"" or more AWAY from the opening to my ear canal... The result is I cannot hear a phone conversation, even at max volume, when there is ambient noise. I drive a 1999 Jeep Grand Cherokee, which is a rather loud ride at 70mph, and I just can't hear well... Now with the Jawbone, I could hear. Some complain that the headset is painful. I have experienced this myself. HOWEVER--if you take some time to carefully bend and adjust the metal ear-hook, you will find that the jawbone is both comfy and will sit quite well on your head. The speaker is near my ear, so I can hear well. Now the bad-the durability of both the hook and the earpiece are awful. The unit ships with a 6 or 8 hooks (I forget--its 3 or 4 for each left or right ear). I have already broken 2 of them. Once I break this one, which I am sure I will, I will have to pony up another $10 to buy another set of hooks. I like to keep the headset in my pocket--and in doing so the hook will bend over time. That means I may have to bend it back to re-adjust the hook to fit my ear well. Bend a piece of metal enough and it will snap. The only way to stop this would be to wear the headset constantly or keep the headset in some other pocket away from any potential forces... The other piece of crappy hardware is the earbud. None of the earbuds were that great a fit for me, but I picked the best one I could find. The earbuds have a rubber portion (that touches your ear). The other side is a hard plastic connector--you place the earbud on the jawbone, and turn 90 degrees to attach it. This mechanism doesn't work. When placing the jawbone on your ear, you will often rub the earbud to your ear, which sometimes turns the earbud. Turn it 90 degrees, and it will fall off. As time goes, this attachment mechanism will wear down, making the earbud move around with even less force, meaning it will fall off constantly.... I just ordered the Jabra EarGels, hoping that they will be much better earbuds, and maybe secure enough to use without the hook. Who knows. As it is, I like the headset when the hook and earbud aren't BROKEN. But, I refuse to spend $10 for new hooks, and $10 for new earbuds each time they break... I want a headset that can be stored in blue-jean pockets without being destroyed!! Maybe the next version will eliminate these issues!",negative,high,precio|calidad

2025-08-15T08:16:42.541466Z,"The short version: rubbish! Way too quiet (especially in-call audio), poor audio quality (obnoxious noise on output) and worse outgoing speech quality. The longer version: Let me start by saying that the premise of the Kensington LiquidAUX Bluetooth car kit is a great one. You can stream music via Bluetooth's A2DP profile to your car stereo's aux connection, and the car kit will also route calls to your stereo, handling muting of music automatically. If only it worked as well as its premise. This was tested in my wife's Scion xB (an '06 - the smaller original version) with the factory head unit (a Scion-badged Pioneer) and an iPhone 3GS. My first impression upon connecting this up in my wife's car was that this would be a cool little car kit - installation and pairing was simple. However, that impression died as soon as I tried to start running audio through it. First of all, the audio from the car kit is way too quiet when playing music. On my wife's head unit, a volume setting of about 15 is reasonable for the radio at any speed, and 20 starts to get obnoxiously loud. CDs tend to be a little quieter on this system, but 20 or so is a reasonable volume for those. To reach a similar music volume from this car kit, this stereo has to be turned up to 40 or so. Worse, the call audio is even quieter, if that's possible. To make a call even vaguely audible, the stereo's volume has to be pushed up north of 50. Even then, it's still way too quiet. This is unforgivable as this is intended to be a completely hands-free kit. In order to hear a call, you have to reach for the stereo to turn the volume up at the start of the call, then you have to scramble to turn it way down again to avoid having your head taken off when the call ends and the music starts again. This is an enormous distraction for a device that's supposed to reduce the driver's workload. This isn't a function of this stereo's Aux input, either. We've run an iPod shuffle to the aux input for over a year now without having to crank the volume up beyond what's needed for a CD. I also tested the iPhone from its headphone output, and that was reasonable, too. I'm not really a fan of doing that, though - you usually have to turn the headphone volume way up to get the signal anywhere close to a standard line output, and that more or less guarantees that you'll forget to lower the volume afterwards and will subsequently have your head taken off the next time you plug your headphones in. Anyway, I digress. It's all a bit academic, however, as even if you can hear the person on the other end of the line, there's almost no chance whatsoever that they can hear you. Since the microphone is part of the body that plugs into the cigarette lighter, it's likely a decent distance away from the driver, and all the noise cancellation in the world isn't going to help that tiny little mic pick up anything. This might be a side-effect of the raised seating position in the xB, but that's hardly uncommon with the number of SUVs and minivans on the road. A much better idea would have been a remote mic that you could stick somewhere on the dash, but perhaps Kensington was afraid of liability having extra cords running about the place. If that wasn't bad enough, there's another major problem with audio quality. There simply isn't enough filtering between the input power and the output audio, and the inherently noisy power source leaks through to your stereo. This might not be so bad if there was a ton of signal to swamp it and make it unnoticeable, but because everything's so quiet, signal/noise is abysmal. On my wife's car, I can hear a higher-pitch whine that varies directly with engine speed (this is probably straight from the alternator, but who knows?) plus a bunch of periodic clicks that also vary with rpm. This is plain annoying when playing music, but is cranked up to irritating and beyond during a call - remember, with the stereo turned way up to compenstate for the quiet calls, all that noise just gets louder. Unfortuately, I made the mistake of initially testing the car kit on battery power only before turning it over to my wife, so all I really noticed was the quiet audio. Let me put it this way: my two year-old was asking what all the funny noise was in the car. That's not a good sign, Kensington. Another ominous sign is that I'm not going to even bother rating the quality of the audio delivered over A2DP. Does it sound badly compressed? Who cares? I reached the limit of my patience with the car kit's other audible flaws long before I even started caring about how A2DP sounds. Oops. Another good premise is the little remote that comes with the system. However, this is a waste of time with the iPhone 3GS. The play/pause button does what you'd expect on the iPod side of the phone, and the call button will answer an incoming call when phone rings and will end the a call in progress. However, unlike many Bluetooth devices, the call button has no other function on the iPhone. Additionally, because the call audio is so quiet, I've hung up on a lot of people because I didn't hear anything, so I hit the call button again. Maybe that's for the best as it means I don't have to go through the whole ""Hello?...(hello?)...Hello?...(hello?)"" routine that this car kit seems to induce. A lot of headsets allow you to use voice dialling, etc. if you press and hold the call button. Not so with the iPhone - even though voice control was added in the most recent version of the OS (3.0), this button has no effect on the iPhone when no call is in progress. That's a huge pity, as voice control actually works fairly well. Additionally, the forward/back buttons have no effect on an iPhone. Where the blame for this lies, I'm not sure. I've seen suggestions that although Apple added A2DP to the iPhone, they didn't bother with AVRCP (A/V remote control profile). This would seem to make sense, and unfortunately makes the remote somewhat pointless. I'm also not convinced that the steering wheel is a good place for the remote. Personally, I wouldn't mind mounting it on the stalk for the wipers, but the rubber doohickey that the remote mounts in is obviously sized for a steering wheel and can't be secured to a stalk. I could take the remote out of its mount and stick it somewhere on the dash, but frankly, given this device doesn't actually have a future in my wife's car, I'm not going to bother. As far as I'm concerned, this was money flushed straight down the drain. Thankfully, I'm still within Amazon's return period, so I can offload it that way. Otherwise, I would just have to eat the cost, as I can't in good faith pawn it off on someone through eBay or whatever. It really is just that bad. Either way, it's going to get ripped out of my wife's car. This is the first doodad I think we've ever had that's basically scored a zero on the Wife Acceptance Factor scale, which is impressive, albeit for all the wrong reasons. Ugh.",negative,low,calidad

The speakerphone is not worthwhile and is only used when absolutely necessary as there is poor voice quality on the other end and the output sound is scratchy and sounds as though the speaker is blown. Another point of frustration I've experienced with the razr is an increase in the voice echo when speaking with other cell phones, although I'm not certain if the fault is the phones or my current networks' issue. Overall, I feel like this phone is a reasonable purchase for 100 dollars for an unlocked phone and I'm satisfied with it.

The basic functionality is that it lets you use your home phone to talk on skype. When you get a skype call, your home phone rings. It works simultaneously with a land line as well. You can have skype and your land line connected at the same time. When you get a skype call your phone will ring differently than when a landline call comes in. It also acts like call waiting. If you're on a skype call and you get a regular call, you'll hear beeps just like call waiting and can flip between the two calls. It works with answering machines too. Incoming calls will ring the same number of times as your landline calls and your answering machine will pick up and they can leave a message just like a regular call. The advanced features are amazing. You can setup the Call Center for skype call forwarding. I have mine set to ring 4 times and if I don't pick up at home, it will use my landline to call my cellphone and connect the skype call. I no longer worry about being at home to take a skype call. The next cool feature is using the Call Center to allow you to make skype calls from any phone on the planet. With this feature enabled, the Call Center will answer your landline phone after a certain number of rings. It can make your PC act like an answering machine. When the greeting comes on, you can type in a secret pin code on the phone and it will then let you dial a skype call and connect you. Picture this: you're at work and have urgent news for your family in another country. Instead of making an international call or going home to make the call, you dial your home phone. The Call Center answering machine on your PC picks up. You punch in your pin and dial your skype speed dial number for your family and the call center connects you. You are now making an international phone call even though you're only paying for the call to your house. When you receive skype calls at home, the skype ID of the person calling will show up on your home phone caller ID. Setup is simple. 1) Install Skype and set it up on your pc 2) Install the software on the CD that came with the Call Center 3) Setup advanced Call Center features on your pc if you want to (it's optional). 4) Connect the Call Center USB cable to your computer 5) Connect your home phone to the Call Center 6) (optional) Connect your landline phone wire to the call Center That's it. You're now in business. Using this box has really improved my life! My parents in europe are not computer savvy and would have NEVER used skype regularly as it is complicated and confusing to them. Now if they want to talk to me, they just pick up the phone and dial ##1. If I want to call them, their phone rings just like normal.

2025-08-15T08:16:43.029855Z,"I've had Nokia, Sony-Ericsson, and Motorola phones - and each has had features that I found to be incredibly useful. I've heard a lot about Samsung phones in the international community and I was excited when I saw that T-Mobile began offering this phone. I was hoping it would be a combination of all that I ever wanted in a phone - but I was disappointed. To begin with, this phone looks great. Well-built, sturdy, and with a high-gloss finish that screams class it received many compliments every time I brought it out. The screen is bright and delivers detailed images and video. By far, this is the nicest screen I've seen on any portable product - including the iPod Video. It slides open and closes smoothly, and the keypad it reveals is backlit and easy to see in the dark. As an MP3 player, it delivers crisper sound than I heard from my Nokia 6600. The Bluetooth worked flawlessly and instanly hooked up with my other phones and my laptop. The camera is as good as any other cell phone camera that promises 1.3MP. In short, what this phone promised ... it delivered. However, I was disappointed mainly because it appeared that the user interface was not as cleverly designed as the physical package. The phonebook only allows three phone entries per name. Looking up names, you can only search by typing the first letters of the last name. For example, suppose you have an entry for ""John Smith"" - if you use the search feature and type in ""Jo"" it will NOT list all the Johns. You have to search for ""Sm.."". Why? Sure you can sort the phone by either the first or last name, but you can only search using one or the other. Not both. My Nokia and Ericsson could do both. Another phonebook problem - suppose you've just called someone's home and now you want to call their cell. You have to start the search over. It doesn't remember your last search. Headset works fine. But if you have the headset on and the phone rings, you don't hear the ring through the earpiece. The phone rings normally and you activate the call by pressing the button on the headset. That sort of negates the purpose. You can listen to MP3s using the headset, but since the headset uses a proprietary connector, you can't use your ""good"" headphones. Maybe when the phone becomes more popular, adapters to standard headphones will be made. The keys under the screen aren't soft - meaning they cannot be reassigned. The left button opens the menu and the right buttom opens the phonebook. My Nokia let me reassign these keys - so, because I use SMS a lot, I could assign one key to open up the message center. Speaking of keys - the entire keypad is nearly flat. This makes it hard to ""feel"" for a key (while driving for example). I don't have particularly large fingers, but I found myself making a lot of mistakes. Another irritating problem - each menu option has a submenu but the submenus have no relation to one another. (This is a hard one to explain). For example, you are going through your list of audio files. You want to delete one. You click ""Options"" and you get a submenu of seven items. #6 is ""Delete"". You can scroll down, but it is faster to just type in the number 6 as a shortcut. So far so good. Now, you are going through your text messages. You want to delete one. The submenu shows the delete as #7. You want to delete a phonebook entry, the delete is #4 in the submenu. No consistency makes it very hard to use shortcuts. All my prior phones had a dedicated ""Clear"" button that can be used anywhere - but if the people at Samsung don't want to ""waste"" a button, they should've at least made the submenus more consistent. By the way, everytime you delete something it asks you if you want to delete ""All or Selected"" - this is an unnecessary step. You can listen to MP3s, but you can't use them as ringtones unless they are converted to 3gp. This is as easy as changing the extention from .mp3 to .3gp on your computer before uploading the song (via bluetooth or USB). Why the extra step? Battery life is terrible. As expected, using the MP3/video player causes a serious drain on your power. One thing I found weird - after listening to MP3s on the phone during a 1-hour flight, the phone became quite warm. I'm not sure if this will affect the phone's general life-span. The beautiful case looks shiny and great - but it smudges really easily. If you aren't using a headset and you have to press this phone to your ear, be prepared for major smudgeness - especially after a long phone call. Another weird thing - you can only use the supplied charger to charge this phone. Even if you have another Samsung phone, you can't use another phone's charger. All my Nokia phones used the same charger. I ended up returning the phone on the last day of my 14-day trial period. It just didn't deliver what I needed, and the annoyances were just too much for me. I am still waiting for the perfect phone - one that combines the best features of all the other phones. I want the appearance of this Samsung (I love the way it looks and feels), but I want the features in all the other phones. I also want it to use standard plugs.",negative,low,

However, I quickly became frustrated with the lack of understandable instructions. If you're not mechanically inclined, I wouldn't recommend this item. I pretty much had to figure it out on my own as the instructions were basically worthless. To make matters worse, this unit doesn't really fit the interior of the Lexus very well. The headliner is not straight across and the drivers side headliner hangs down about 3 more inches than the passenger side. Not really sure why, but it did make getting the unit installed correctly, very difficult, if not impossible.

It showed up and I came in over the weekend and ran my own coax from my office to the outside wall (about 40'). I completed the hookup (about 2 hours including mounting, tucking cords, etc.). I checked my phone and the bars did not change. I called Wilson and they walked me through the Gain settings. The Wilson representative asked if I checked my phone and explained to me that since I have 4G, the bars on my phone won't show the boosted change. I was very skeptical. Well, no worries, he was right. The signal works great. It has been over 6 months since I installed the booster and have had no dropped calls. I went from daily dropped calls to zero dropped calls.

2025-08-15T08:16:43.216109Z,"After considerable research, I finally took the plunge and purchased my first smartphone, Motorola's Q Global 9h. I had used a PDA off and on but was disenchanted with docking stations, stylus usage, and carrying both a phone and a PDA. I am extremely pleased with this purchase but bear in mind, I have not owned other brands. Compared to similar offerings, the Motorola Q is much slimmer and lightweight. I was attracted to its functionality, its looks, and its potential to do what I needed done. The voice and sound qualities of the phone exceed my expectations as does the built in camera. I have not yet tried to use the music aspects but that was not important to me in my selection. The full QWERTY keyboard is easy to use compared to others in this class and the interface to the internet is very easy to manipulate. Its voice recognition component has been outstanding so far. The standard battery has been so functional to this point, that I have not even charged the extended battery. Since my corporate system is based on Windows, I needed a Windows Mobile software unit to sync with my corporate requirements. I was amazed with how quickly I was able to sync with my work units, how quick the interface is, and how accessible my emails and corporately based data is now available in my handset wherever I am in the US or world (mostly). All my contacts, my calendar, and all incoming emails appear in my handset within seconds of arriving at my office computer. I especially appreciate the ability to receive my Windows based email from work on my MOTO Q9h but also my email from accounts at AOL and Yahoo. One glance at the screen and I can see email waiting on my Outlook account, my AOL account, a text message, and any voicemails. I assume other smartphones can do this, but it is pretty slick, nonetheless. All in all, this is a great smartphone and I am extremely pleased with it. It is reassuring to know I have the equivalent of everything from an MP3 player to a camera to an internet portal to a video player--all that and a great phone too!

Very sleek, very useful, tons of features. The only really annoying trait of all of the Moto Razr phones is that the glass is horribly thin and flimsy, and is very easy to break (both inner and outer glass). Good luck finding replacement glass for it - and when you do, expect to pay $15 bucks for it. When you replace the glass, if you don't position it just right, it's easy to break again, because it will be possible to put too much pressure on it. It's not possible to remove it and reposition it, because the glue is so sticky and the glass so thin, that you'll break it just getting it off again. These days you can buy a flip phone with more features for $30 bucks. Yes, I still prefer flip phones. They call them ""throw back"" phones now.

2025-08-15T08:16:44.045275Z,"I bought the Jawbone 2 when it came out because it was supposed to be the best headset out there. It wasn't. First of all, the headset would not stay in my ear no matter what, without an ear loop. I don't mind that so much but the ear loops that come with the headset are too short, so the headset has a habit of slipping until it points straight down or falls off. Eventually, I found sound Jabra ear pieces that fixed all my fit-problems and I had a pretty decent experience with the headset since (also, the styling matched my Switcheasy Serpent iPhone case exactly, which was cool). The NoiseAssassin is very effective (provided you don't have a beard... or a very thin beard at most). However, about 9 months in, audio coming out of the headset started sounding distorted and buzzy. It got worse and worse until I set it aside because I couldn't understand people any more, just using the clunky iPhone earbuds instead. Recently, I contacted Jawbone support to see if they had any ideas, explaining that I'd had it since it first came out. First, they had me perform a reset on the headset. When that didn't work, they said they'd replace it. I was actually pretty stoked since I didn't expect that sort of offer. So I gave them my information and faxed them a copy of my receipt (I ordered it directly from them, I should add). It took a week of email tag since they claimed they couldn't open any of the files I emailed to them (including PDF's and even a plain-text file), so I had to fax it from work (who uses faxes any more?). A week later, I get a call from them - saying that my warranty had expired a month prior and they wouldn't replace the headset. What? I was under the impression that they understood I'd had the thing forever (I mentioned it several times in my correspondence). I pointed that out as well as the fact that I wasn't aware the thing had a warranty at all and I was just happy they were going to replace it out of a commitment to good service. Guess not. Instead, I would up being lied to and having my time wasted. It's partially my fault for waiting so long to get a hold of them, but customer service people really shouldn't go making promises they have no intention of keeping. That's absolutely unacceptable. Since I have to buy a brand new headset now, I'm going to go with Logitech, whose products and customer service ALWAYS exceed my expectations. This was my last Jawbone.",negative,high,envío

The proprietary power connector is a pain (what about a mini USB jack) as you need to get more (for use in the office) or carry it around with you. Once you get it working, it works fine; but somebody needs to revisit the industrial design and put some real buttons on this thing that you can tell when they have been punched, and a standard USB jack.

It fits around my bicep with plenty of extra room, but I am a small lady without much arm muscle. I find it a bit awkward to insert my phone into the case, it usually takes me a bit to get it in there, especially if I am putting anything else in it (like money or keys). There are two small holes at the top for speakers which work well. The frustrating part about this case is that you are not able to use the phone through the plastic (at least I wasn't on my Droid) and taking your phone in and out of the case on a run is near impossible. Also, sometimes when I put my phone into the case it hits buttons and the volume goes way up or it turns the music off altogether. But that might just be my phone. My boyfriend borrowed the armband the other day and used it with his iPhone. He was somewhat able to use his phone through the plastic cover which was nice. But he had to put the armband on his forearm because it was too tight higher up. But it still worked for him well. The fabric is really nice and breathable. It dries quickly.

I've been using it for several months in a very noisy server room environment. Having gone through multiple supposedly ""noise canceling"" phones, this is the first one that really passed muster with customers. I had been using this on my standard phone line and integrated it with my laptop's Outlook directory. Simple, easy and excellent! Within 5 minutes I had 200 contacts loaded onto the phone. It's nice that you can manually edit the phone numbers and contact information before they're loaded onto the phone so you don't wind up with extraneous data. I just switched over to using VOIP instead of a phone line, and decided to use this with my Mac instead of Windows. Honestly, it's not so good. Unlike other phones that are specifically designed to be VOIP phones, you can't dial the phone through the handset anymore - you have to use the softphone. You can answer and disconnect calls, but that's all. The software for the Mac is not as mature as it is for the PC, either. The Calisto Pro utility for the Mac frequently loses connectivity to the Mac and doesn't show up in the utility bar that it's lost its connection. So, you'll be dialing away through the softphone only to hear your party answering - and you're not audible. It's not a very professional image to present if you're using this for work, as I do. So far, the software for Windows is more reliable. No matter which operating system - once you have a successful connection, sound quality is excellent. The earpiece is very comfortable and the device has wonderful range. I'd like to see Plantronics improve the quality, reliability and feature set of the VOIP offering for this device. Otherwise, it's a pretty expensive wireless USB headset - albeit one with excellent clarity and range.",positive,low,calidad

On Motorola's mistake, they sent me a H715 instead. I didn't immediately notice though but little things were different. The black shade was a little different and then I noticed ""tones"". Tones when I would connect, disconnect, etc. that I did not have with the H710. I like both colors and they both go good with my original iPhone. I think amazon has the best price on both of these... I would highly recommend them. I am currently testing the Plantronics Voyager Pro and notice that it doesn't like my blackberry. It works fine with my original iPhone but the voice quality isn't as great as it was with the H7XX series. I'm returning it and requesting a replacement to see if it was just that one headset. I'm really rooting for the PRO. I find the H7XX series are easier to carry in the pocket as it folds nicely. The PRO feels great and the smallest ear rubber piece works great for my ears. I've had the headset on for hours and using the smallest ear rubber has worked the best. But enough of the Pro. Thank you for your time. UPDATE 01/09/2012 These Motorola H7XX series seem to have about a 10-16 month lifespan. And still I love them. I have used the Motorola warranty right before the 1 year limit and have received either a refurbished or a brand new one which again last about another year or so.

Before I bought the product I climbed on the roof and verified that I had three bars and good call clarity. I fist tried mounting the antenna the peak of the roof line with the base unit in the basement. Didn't seems to work too well. My coax ran within 4"" and perpendicular to a 110V power line, so I repositioned the coax to emlimante this interference with no improvement, sometimes I would get a little better signal but not really a usable signal. So I went out and bought an antenna mount with a 10 foot mast and mounted the antenna at the peak of the roof, I placed the base station in the basement on the floor. This is as much vertical seperation as I can legally have as I am limited in antenna height, this is at least 25 feet of vertical seperation. I still cannot figure out the blinking lights on the base unit after reading the manual several times as they all blink in various patterns pretty much constantly. I don't think there is anything else I can do to improve the installation per the instructions. Now sometimes I get pretty good reception standing by the base unit (3 bars) and about 2 bars on my main floor but other times the system does not appear to be functioning at all. The system seems to be really flakey in the fact that it works sometimes okay but other time not really at all. I have to say I am dissapointed because I spent allot of time trying to get the system installed correctly with poor results and the unit was very expensive without good results, I pretty much feel like I wasted $300.",negative,low,precio

Cannot see caller ID, missed messages etc. When keying in phone numbers that you are calling, numbers are large and legible but all else is horrible. Of course this is standard to all LCDs(read modern screens) verses older VGA(read much better resolution and contrast). I am about to relicense my older LG phone with VGA. Software menu's are much harder to use then older menu layout and software on previous LG's. The absolute worst defect(feature?) is when you receive a call, it is almost impossible to retrieve from your pocket without touching the call interruption button on the outside edge of the phone. This of course disconnects the call and with the crummy screen and you are outside, it is impossible to tell who was calling that you disconnected. This design flaw could be very easily corrected by several means that would take even a full blown idiot about 5 minutes to think up. Possibly requiring 2 rapidly hits to the disconnect button to cut off a call. There are other simple ideas to resolve this problem. This was a problem with my previous LG. You would think that these miscreants that design this stuff would use it in the real world before foisting there newest bright ideas on to the unsuspecting consumer. In other words to see what us chickens are eating out here. I do not like the way the square edge of the earpiece fits my ear. The more rounded oval type edges are far better for getting audio into the ear canal. As noted by others, the keyboard sucks.

Do like the slimline of the phone and its high tech look. Only reason that I upgraded(?) phone was to gain bluetooth but am finding that my older phone was far more ergonomically user friendly. But of course these designers are engineers and most do not live in the real world anyway. I see this poor design in so many modern products.",negative,low,calidad

The pairing process with my LG PM-325 was long and I had to call Jabra to get it completed. The caller ID is a great concept by not very functional since you can not look at it while you are wearing the head set. This is good for someone who does not talk for a long time and does not want to keep the headset on between calls. The ""Noise-Cancelling"" is not worth it. I ended up buying a Jabra FreeSpeak 250 and I am much happier. It is great to wear all day.",positive,low,

2025-08-15T08:16:45.823909Z,"The X3 looked like a great little headset, and I loved the fact that it had 3 different charging methods included... Paired easily with my LG VX8300, looks nice, fits fairly well on the ear, but that is when the praise ends. Overall, there is a large amount of static during calls that I have not experienced with other headsets on my phone. There is also quite a ""delay lag"" when audio begins through the headset, which usually results in missing the initial part of calls/communications. Also, the range is less than ideal, I found it rather limited when I tested it and compared to other BT headsets on my phone. All of these are unfortunate, but not completely crippling, for the overall usability of the headset. I even tried contacting BlueAnt's technical support department, in case I had a bad unit, but only ever received an email confirming they got my original report of an issue... Then absolutely nothing. Being in the technical support field myself, I find lack of support competency to be a big strike against a company and its products.",negative,high,
2025-08-15T08:16:45.861832Z,This is my first blue tooth device and it has good features. I can play my podcasts stored on my phone through this to my stereo system. You can also listen to your phone caller through your stereo or the local speaker built-in (which sounds good for such a small device).

2025-08-15T08:16:45.965873Z,"This was my first bluetooth headset purchase and after only 2 weeks I just made my second bluetooth headset purchase. I read lots of reviews on amazon and cnet and the Blue Ant Z9i is the only one that I came across with a 5 star rating. That was 2 weeks ago and I see it's now down to a 4 star rating. I have no complaints about the audio quality. I'm hearing impaired and wear hearing aids so I do need to take 1 of the hearing aids out to use the headset but I was still able to understand conversations crystal clear on the other end. I encountered some statis a few times but when I moved around a bit that seemed to disappear. I asked several people on the other end how my voice sounded and they all said it was fine. So no complaints about the audio. The fit however, is another story. Once the headset was in my ear for a few seconds with the ear hook on it was ok and I didn't really notice too much that it was in. But getting it into my ear wasn't a smooth process. Either I have very smell openings on my ears or the ear bud is on the large side. I did manage to get it in and for the most part it was comfortable enough that I wouldn't complain about it. But if I had to rate it on it's fit I would not give it 5 stars. the ear hook was an issue from day one. Because I wear hearing aids I switched back and forth each day between my left and right ears so that my hearing aid batteries drained evenly. The first time I switched the postion of the ear hook it came detached from the unit and although I was able to get it on well enough to stay on my ear, I knew it wasn't as secure as it could or should be. I was constantly checking to make sure it was still sitting on my ear properly. I think they could've done a much betterjob designing a sturdier ear hook. I'm also visually impaired and can't really see the display all that well so the only functions I used were turning the powere on + off, always checking to make sure the up volume button was as high as it goes, and pressing the MFB to use voice activation to dial calls. I can't comment on the other features such as call waitinig, muting, etc because I didn't use them. I just ordered a replacement bluetooth headset and went with the Motorola H700 this time. The ear hook seems to be better constructed and I think I'll like it better just touching my ear rather than jamming a too big earbud into my ear. My hearing aids that go into my ears are nowhere near as big as this headset. If the earhook and earbud aren't issues for you you'll like this headset just fine.",neutral,low,calidad

2025-08-15T08:16:46.273303Z,"Great product over all! With the replaceable foam in-ear buds you get the best bass frequencies that this product can produce! (Downside, with any headphones for that matter: Awareness of your surroundings are severely impaired and reduced to only hearing loud noises, use regular in-ear buds for sketchy areas of travel) As noted, the stereo cable breaks very easily on the hook, at the connecting joints, and there are ***NO MORE REPLACEMENTS IN PRODUCTION***. The replacement stereo cable has been discontinued indefinitely, as well as this product. The only replacements I could find are second generation found only on Ebay.com and in my opinion, look horrible connected to such a sophisticated and elegant device. I am not even sure how I broke the stereo cable but if I were to guess, I sat on them. I just took them out of my side leg pocket after I sat down on the train/rail/subway and they were broken. After months of trying to find the actual replacement stereo cable, I bought an entirely new unit and don't intend on having it leave the house too often. I am also getting a cheap side holster / waist case for it when it does leave the house, no more pockets for this beautiful Bluetooth stereo headset / headphones. (I also purchased the Sony Ericsson HBH-IS800 Stereo Bluetooth Headset for outside the house music listening, they still look awesome, cheaper, much smaller, less bulky, still Bluetooth, and look much less likely to break). Connection interruptions during skateboarding (righty) while iPhone 4 was in my right pocket (Bluetooth in right ear), others had same problem with running.

So I'm quite puzzled that this phone isn't being pushed as much as the N95. It's got the right dimensions, not too heavy in the shirt pocket, feels good in my hand, the keypad has excellent touch and layout with 1-press keys for Calendar, Contacts, Email, Bluetooth (on/off) and Silent/General mode. It's real cool that the 1-press keys for Calendar, Contacts and Email have different modes. Short press starts the app (Calendar, Contacts, Email). Long press starts a new record within the app (new calendar entry, new contact, new message). I've re-assigned the 1-press key for Email to start the Messaging app, and long press starts the CryptoGraf Messaging app to encrypt my messages. There's WLAN internet access with a proper browser. The camera, with just 2 MegaPixels, is good enough for my needs. The screen is crystal clear and good for viewing video and images. BTW, I thought it gets scratched quite easily, but that's just the plastic screen protector. I removed the screen protector and the screen stays scratch free even after I put the phone in my trouser pocket along with my keys. Another feature that makes the upgrade from E50 to this E51 a great idea...there's a font setting for adjusting the menu font sizes to Large, Medium, Small. Voice call quality is quite good. The speakers are also quite good but they're awkwardly located on the back. The volume controls on the side of the phone are not easy to use...it's quite confusing that the 'cursor key' acts as a volume control for the media player, but the voice call volume control is on the side of the phone. The CPU is very fast at 350MHz, Bluetooth 2.0+EDR, Mini USB 2.0, 2.5 mm A/V connector.

2025-08-15T08:16:46.664114Z,"I've had my T-Mobile Sidekick II (produced by Danger, Inc for Sharp) since December 2004. I got one because my pal Leo Laporte got one. We seem to trade tech fetish material back and forth, he convinced me to buy a Sidekick just by talking about it, I came on his show to pimp the Playstation Portable (more on that in another article). It's a fun little game we play. Now, let me preface this article by saying that I really really despise PDAs. I used to have a Palm III, IIIe, and IIIc back from 1999-2000. I may have hated them because I had no life to organize, but I came away from the PDA fad revolution thinking they were an utter waste of time. I still do today, and PDAs seem to be getting even more expensive by the day and don't do what a person needs them to. There are many types of cell phones that have tried this formula and failed, and many successful ones which are not as tactile as this phone (the Blackberry, Treo 600 and Treo 650 for instance). There are also insanely expensive phones like the Sony-Ericsson P900 which are basically just a Palm unit in a phone (aka a ""smart"" phone)... who the hell wants to use a stylus to pick a telephone call up? I'd like to meet `em. The Sidekick is a totally different beast. It's essentially a kinda-chunky cell phone combined with a few communication utilities that people actually use and a 640480 integrated digital camera. There is an AIM client built in, a Yahoo Messenger client that is downloadable free inside the unit, a semi-full-featured POP-compatible e-mail client, a web browser, and my killer app, the $10 downloadable SSH Terminal client. It also has a few things I don't use like a basic scheduler and to-do list. I can't say there's a feature other than the last two I listed that I don't use on this phone. It's a marvel of engineering and a phone that clearly was designed by geeks (the calculator app says `31337&#8242; on the application icon's display), but is also insanely user friendly and every button on the unit does what you'd think it would do in applications on the phone. The sidekick uses some form of java to serve up it's programs and is decently fast. Certainly not breaking any speed records but it does what it needs to do. The AOL Instant Messenger client gets a LOT of use by me, I always have this on when I'm walking around, and the implementation of this on the phone is insanely good. It's almost as tactile to use as AIM on a laptop and typing to others using the qwerty keyboard is so fast most of my friends do not even realize they're talking to me on it while I'm driving 70 miles per hour down the highway going somewhere. The second most used feature is definitely the Sidekick's built in 640480 camera. It is pretty terrible in low light situations (sometimes I have to hold the camera steady for up to 5 seconds to get it to ""adjust"" to the light so you can even see anything), however I still use it very often and having it nearby has become an almost invaluable resource for documenting strange things I see everywhere. Once the photo is taken the built in mail program on the sidekick can send it to any email address you can think of in seconds. I absolutely love this feature. The mail client on the Sidekick is very impressive. You can have up to 4 email addresses active, in addition to the provided @tmail.com address you get with the phone. The phone fully supports POP email as well and grabs new mail from T-Mobile's server in a sort of ""push"" fashion every 15 or 30 minutes (I am not sure on the exact interval). Pictures can be viewed and sent in email, and you can tell it to strip attachments of different types to save on phone memory, which comes in very handy since the unit only has 6MB of storage space to store mail in. I am not sure why they skimped in this department, but they made tools to keep it easy to manage the mail coming in, such as an auto-delete after X days feature to keep you below your 6MB memory limit. Contacts pop up based on the email address you filled into their phone book entry in your phone and it supports fuzzy searches of a few letters allowing you to scroll and quickly select the person you were looking for to add to the email list. The web browser on the sidekick leaves a little to be desired. It does not support JavaScript and has a bit of difficulty with frames, and with images turned on some sites don't load at all or load insanely slow. I turned images off on my sidekick to speed up browsing since I usually use it to find phone numbers or addresses anyway. It is fast enough now with the images turned off on the web browser but I hope by the time the Sidekick 3 rolls around there will be faster data networks in place and better software. One of the features that does not come on the Sidekick by default is the Terminal program. Useful only to real geeks and unix/linux nerds, this feature allows you to remotely control any unix based machine via a secure shell. I use this currently to SSH into a linux machine I have sitting at home that has irssi on it (a popular command line irc client) - so I can use IRC from the road. I take credit for discovering this feature myself and turning Leo on to it. Dan 1, Leo 0 :) . This is just a killer app for any nerd who wants to chat anywhere, anytime. Boring movie or dinner? Just whip this out and talk to people who aren't boring to you. Other than those three features, some neat features the Sidekick has are: - Reflective TFT screen: Even in broad sunlight the LCD is easy to read, an essential thing for using this outside. The sun reflects off the LCD making it even brighter than the built in backlight. - Flip up screen with qwerty keyboard / scroller: Both are a godsend. The scroll wheel is very intuitive also. - Picture Phone Book Entries: you can snap a photo of your friend and attach it to their phonebook entry, so every time they call you see their ugly face grinning at you. - Ability to view JPG, GIF, PDF and WAV files: Hallelujah! Picture format support is excellent for a device like this. You can also play WAV files... I've been told you can assign WAV files to ring tones but haven't bothered with it yet. - Games: Many many downloadable games for this including a version of Snake called Snake DX. The standard cell phone fare, not very good graphics but sorta fun. Here's my summary of this unit. Pros: + Excellent Mail, AIM, and Terminal programs + Excellent screen for the size + Insanely well designed user interface! Both hardware and software! + Flip-out hidden QWERTY keyboard is amazing. + Only has the stuff you need and nothing else + Nationwide AIM and IRC! I'm in heaven! Cons: - Battery only lasts about 1.5 days - Slightly bulky (didn't bother me much) - Web browser is slow with images turned on - Camera has poor low light performance - No bluetooth support - High price (around $300) if you don't buy it with a plan, but who cares! My final call: Buy this thing if you possibly can! It is $20/mo on top of your existing T-mobile plan for unlimited data, or $25/mo if you do not want phone service. People constantly stop me when I'm out and ask me about this thing. It is a head-turner, that's for sure. It's so good that I almost regret owning a laptop these days.",negative,low,precio

2025-08-15T08:16:46.781116Z,"I got this device because I have little to no service at the beach home. The problem I have with this device is that they say outside installation is best but DON'T tell you at the time of purchase that you should purchase an OPTIONAL outdoor kit. If it is recommeded that you put it outdoors, don't you think that they would include it or tell you at time of purchase that this kit is needed? The other problem is again associated with outdoor installation. They give you ab. 30 feet of coaxial cable which is great. The problem is that BOTH ends are finished with the crimped attachment hardware....try getting THAT through the existing cable hole to the outside. So, another trip to the hardware store 17 miles one way to get a crimping tool and masonry bits and screws to PROPERLY attach the mounting hardware for the signal atenna on the OUTSIDE brick. However, once the installation is done... several hours, miles and dollars later... I can get 3-4 bars when I used to only get 1-2 bars at best!

2025-08-15T08:16:46.972234Z,"After losing my last Plantronics 510 to a ""dog incident"", I picked up another 510, a Motorola H710 and a Jabra BT8040 and put them to the test head-to-head. I use a Uniden cordless land-line phone that can pair with a BT headset, and a Palm Centro smartphone. All three of these phones support multipoint. The H710 failed to cancel echo (my voice played back to me delayed) on the Uniden phone, and the BT8040 would not pair with the Uniden at all. All three worked well with the Centro. All three headsets had very good audio quality in quiet environments. The 510 was best in noisy and windy environments. The H710 had the loudest volume and was easiest to hear callers. The BT8040 in extremely loud environments would apparently get confused in its echo cancellation algorithms and tend to experience audio cutouts (for the wearer, not the caller). The H710 has the best ""user interface"". Love how flipping the little boom mike open and closed turns on and off the headset. It's audio prompts are intuitive and pleasant. The BT8040 and H710 both have good button/LED usage designs. The BT8040 requires a 3-5 second button press to turn the phone on and off -- otherwise it is the user interface equal to the H710. In comparison, the 510 has a less polished interface. The power button is hard to use, and it constantly flashes a blue light when on, which grabs the attention of those around you -- a feature that I find quite annoying. The interface of the BT8040 is just as good, with the exception that on and off requires a 3-5 second button press -- less elegant than the H710's approach. The 510 has a big flaw in its user interface: a blue light flashes all the time it is on. Combined with its large size, the 510 annoyingly draws the attention of those around you. Pocketability is a big concern for me. The 510 isn't really pocketable. I never broke one in 3 years, but then almost never put it in my pocket for fear of breaking it. The H710 when off is nearly a sphere and is easily pocketable. The BT8040 is a micro-sized ""brick"" in shape, smaller than the H710 and about equally pocketable. Headset fit is another bit concern. The 510 is the most comfortable for me. The BT8040 is second, which surprised me. The H710's hard ear-loop rubs on my ear in one spot and pretty quickly becomes uncomfortable. The 510 isn't amenable to glasses, but the other two are. All of the headsets are secure. The 510 fits well as a result of its design. The BT8040 fits well, in part because it is so very small and light. The H710 'hangs' and 'flaps' against the ear, is the least secure of all three, but didn't ever fall off when I was testing it. Battery life is good on all units. I don't talk enough to give them a hard workout in this regard. However, the 510 seems to take the longest to charge, the BT8040 the fastest, and the H710 in the middle. I found the H710 to be the worst of the three. It's performance in noisy conditions doesn't compare well to the others. It's fit is the worst, at least on my ear. The H710 is definitely the loudest of the three, which could be a boon for many headset wearers. Just don't plan on using it in very noisy situations.",positive,low,calidad

2025-08-15T08:16:46.994356Z,"I had this phone for two days before trading it in for a cheaper, sturdier phone. I was absolutely in love with the features but in the end the actual hardware convinced me to return it. The good: It comes with windows mobile 6, which includes windows explorer, word, excel and powerpoint (read and edit). It also has a sharp 2.0 megapixel camera and a decent video recorder. My favorite feature was the touch screen which responded well to my fingers as well as the included stylus. It has handwriting recognition and virtual keyboard for input. You can press the talk button to bring up a virtual keypad, and in general I found it quite easy to make phone calls. I only used the wifi card with the internet and found it to be pretty fast, although browsing the web tends to drain the battery. Even so, you can get a good two days use out of it if you remember to turn the wireless card off when not using it, otherwise it'll constantly be searching the area and will empty the battery in hours. Also, as others have said, the phone has a very nice soft rubbery feel to it. It's also a very pretty phone with rich colors. The bad: I almost never used the slide out keyboard because it's very flat and has a slippery plastic feel. Also there was a delay when you slid it out when the phone tries to reorient itself. In general the phone is a little slow, due to its 201 MHz processor, and you'll have to constantly close out programs in order to keep in running smoothly. When the keyboard is closed, it doesn't lock in, so that it's always wiggling around. This is especially annoying when you're on the phone for a while. It also comes with very little memory. With all the programs, you won't have enough room in the internal memory for even one song, so purchasing extra memory is a must. The phone is also quite bulky and fragile, so you'll be paranoid about dropping it. In the end I was sad to return it because it's got some really amazing features, but I just couldn't justify the price with all the flaws.",negative,low,precio

The reception is 3 bars upstairs in my house and 2 bars downstairs. Call quality is better than the previous phones I have owned (old sprint one, and motorola startac). Changeable faceplates gives the phone a customizable touch. Ring tones sound a bit fuzzy with the phone open it seems but when shut sound fine. A very odd variety of ring tones as well.
