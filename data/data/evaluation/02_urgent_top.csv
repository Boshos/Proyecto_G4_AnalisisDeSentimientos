"In December 2007 I renewed my AT&T contract and got a Motorola Q9H. Yesterday (Feb 2008), when unplugging the phone from the charger, the charge socket on the phone came right out of the phone - it appears that it is held on by a small amount of solder on the junctions, and the solder joints are dull and look dry. I called my local AT&T store and they said, no problem, there is a 12 month warranty, and I need to call a 1-800 number and they will send out a replacement. So I called the number. They tell me that they will send out a replacement, and I must send in the phone, but should they determine that this is due to ""physical damage"" they will bill me $399, and there is no way to get the old phone back. I asked why I can't send the old phone in without them shipping out a new one and have them call me to tell me whether it is covered under warranty (which is should be; I did not mistreat the phone) and if not, give me a quote to have it repaired. They can't do that, they said. My only options are to decide up front to send it for repair (and pay for the repair), or gamble $399 that they will do the right thing. Obviously the phone is ""physically damaged"" but that is due to a defect, not abuse, so this doesn't sound like a good gamble to me. So I'm left with a broken phone less than 3 months old. It was a nice phone while it worked.",negative,1.0
"Like so many others, I am on a perpeptual search for the ""perfect"" Bluetooth headset. I want it to slip over my ear quickly, to fit firmly into my ear canal, allow me to hear clearly while I am standing in the midst of a roaring crowd and reproduce my voice perfectly no matter how lousy my connection. Someone on quest like this encounters a lot of disappointment. The Jabra 510 met some of these requirements, but not the critical ones. Hearing the other party often required pressing it into my ear and I often received complaints that I was difficult to hear. Many reviews on the Jawbone have been glowing . . . and some have been downright derogatory. I figured that I might as well try it. The design is visually appealing, but the earband is a piece of bad design. Apparently made of aluminum or some metal alloy, it is relatively inflexible and difficult to place over the ear. One point against. There have also been reports that these earloops are easy to break. There are only two buttons, both of which are hidden. One is relatively easy to find, the other requires a bit of hunting. This second button is also the volume control. Press it a bit too long and you've just turned off Bluetooth and lost your call. The visual indicators for status are sparse, so often you are left guessing as to precisely what status your Jawbone is in. I found that restablishing my Bluetooth connection, which I had accidentally severed, was way more difficult than it had to be. Initial pairing was flawlessly simple, but if you lose your connection while driving on an expressway, for example, trying to reconnect turns you into an accident waiting to happen. Received audio quality is pretty good. Using the standard ear bud, the fit was good, but not perfect. The volume control proved to be hit-or-miss. Sometimes pressing it as the directions specified increased the volume. Sometimes it broke my Bluetooth connection. I tested the voice transmission capability by turning up the television and radio at the same time and calling my own voicemail. I must tell you, the noise cancelling technology works very well. Voice quality is acceptable: we're talking cell phone audio here, not concert hall acoustics. The battery seems to last the specified times, but the proprietary charger connections are not only a bad idea, but stupid as well. While one end of the cable can be plugged into a standard USB slot, the end that attaches to the Jawbone is proprietary. This is just plain dumb. It should be a mini-USB. Instead you have to remember to pack yet one more cable. Is the Jawbone worth the premium price? Kind of doubtful. With other headsets, I've never been unable to complete a phone call, although sometimes I have had a hard time hearing and being understood. The Jawbone does make your voice more intelligible with its noise cancelling abilities. So I guess the determination would be how often you would need to depend on that noise cancelling technology. I am also wary of Aliph's customer support. Many Amazon reviews have remarked on poor build quality, breakage and very poor customer support by the manufacturer. Jerry",neutral,1.0
"I've purchased two of these phones but I didn't get a chance to use the phone I purchased from Amazon. My phone arrived fairly quickly but when I opened the box it was immediately obvious that the phone manufacturer's box that's inside the Amazon.com box had been opened. When I opened the manufacurer's box all of the packing material was missing and the box contained only loose phone parts (phone body, back cover, battery, AC adapter) that had apparently been bouncing around alot. The phone was badly damaged, the front of the phone was a spider web of cracks and it appeared that the camera lens may have been cracked as well. I sent it back the next day and Amazon gave me a prompt credit for my return in about a week. After receiving my credit from Amazon I went to ebay and bought this phone for about $30 more and it arrived brand new and in perfect condition. It also came with many accessories, including software CD, data cable, stereo headset, holster, car charger and 1GB memory chip. I installed my SIM card and the memory chip and the phone works like a champ. I loaded the phone tools software on my HP laptop and it immediately updated to the latest version. I just use the synchronization for my Outlook contacts and calender and it has worked well with only one minor issue. For some reason the software was synchronizing with the calendar information in my archive folder. Once I changed the synchronization setting to go to my current calendar folder there have been no issues. So far I've only downloaded a few ringtones from the internet and they have downloaded quickly and flawlessly. This is my first Motorola phone (I'm a former Nokia owner) and I have found this phone easy to use. The sound quality is very clear, definitely better than any of the Nokia phones I've had, and the signal strength and reception seem to be better as well. I've had no problems with accidental pushing of the buttons on the exterior of the phone. The phone construction is very solid, nothing cheesy here. I have the black model and the finish is excellent and after a week of use remains without a scratch. I'm very happy with this phone and would recommend it to others although I would purchase it elswhere since Amazon's supplier seems to to be getting a reputation for poor packaging and damage during shipment.",positive,1.0
"Ordered this 'charging kit' for my Tungsten E2 through BargainCell, as I have purchased from them in the past, and up until this, didn't have a problem with them. Found that this 'charging kit' WILL NOT charge a Tungsten E2! Back and forth e-mails to BargainCell, two long distance telephone calls, about an hour on the telephone, with them telling me that this 'charging kit' is compatible with both Tungsten and Treo models. Well is 'not'... The cable will initiate a 'sync' when the button is pressed, but it will not charge the E2. Tested it myself, compared it to an original Palm cable and noticed that the cable from BargainCell has about half the number of pins in the connector base to connect to the Palm. No doubt missing the ones that provide the 'charging'! Kind-of makes the USB car adapter and the wall adapter like totally 'useless', unless someone wants to try and sync their palm to their car, or home! Looking around the Internet I see many similar products, all claiming to be compatible with both the Tungsten and the Treo. After this experience, with BargainCell still claiming that these cables are compatible with both models, now I have to question 'all' other such listings, making the same claim! Paying nearly as much for shipping as the item itself, BargainCell expected me to send this back for a refund! No doubt not refunding 'my' shipping expenses back to them, and deducting the shipping expenses I already paid to have this sent to me! Needless to say, a loosing proposition either way to me. Either go through all that trouble and expense for what would be a 'couple dollar' refund, or keep the USB auto and wall charger and toss the cable in the garbage. With numerous other listing all making the same claim as to 'compatibility', I think I'll save my time and aggravation and just spend the $20.00 and get an original from Palm! Had similar experiences with other 'so-called' compatible imported products, dumped on the market cheaply. No more for me! I'll spend the extra and get original OEM products, and probably in the long run, actually save money, not having to deal with time lost on e-mails and telephone calls, after incompatibly issues are discovered, and companies not bothering to do proper research! And what really gets me, is with something so 'simple'! BargainCell is most likely just a reseller of imported goods, taking the word of the importer as 'gospel', and not listening to a customer when they are called telling them that 'Hey... this doesn't work'! Don't know what 'value' others put on their time, but this experience probably wound up costing me more than double the cost of an OEM product! Was this really a 'Bargain'?",negative,1.0
"UPDATED Feb 9th 2008: Well the BT5020 is now dead, I'm sending it back to jabra and we will see from there what happens. Following my initial review I returned the unit for replacement once and that fixed some of the sound issues, not all of them but enough that I was acceptably pleased. Over the 6 months I found the unit to be functional and seldom did it offer me reason to complain, the sound was clear and I could be heard without many ever offering complaint, unless I was outdoors in a wind, but I think some aspects are to be understood and tolerated. I will note though, using the dual connection capability was nice, but glitchy, especially when hooked to a nextel and using direct connect, then things truly got fouled up and generally connections were lost to the phones and often calls. Over all I won't lower or raise my review on this unit, it worked when it worked and while far from stellar, I think for 30 bucks it was acceptable. ________________________________________________________________ I'm new to the BT ear piece market, this being my second in the past few months. My first was/is the Jabra BT500, which is very enjoyed... once I got used to tolerating the eargel discomfort, and no adjustability for fit. So my hopes were high with the BT5020, in getting rid of the eargels and allowing for some angle and length of speaker position, would fix my comfort levels. So my first impressions of the BT5020 was wow, this is comfortable, it weighs less, no eargel and the size is very balanced with the over all package. Turned on the power and it started in pair mode, and paired without a glitch or bump with my Sanyo 8400. So far so good, I was working in the yard, so decided to leave it on and see how I liked the fit and feel. And to speak straight, I forgot I had it on and got the sudden reminder of it real quick when my wife called, the vibrate alert went off (I'd forgotten it had vibrate alert) and I nearly came unglued tell I recalled what was doing it. This thing is that comfortable, no feeling like my ear is plugged up, no strange pulling or pushing, or slippage to keep telling me I have something on/in my ear. The phone call however set off the first warning signs, there was very distinct static and crackling, this with my phone on my hip on the same side as the earpiece. I kept it in mind but kept working for a few hours before deciding to go and really play with my new earpiece. I started conducting some tests around the house, called customer service of my phone company, and figured to kill two birds with one stone. I had the phone on a shelf at the same level as my ear, about 3 feet away. The static wasn't noticed this time so I began moving around the room and it returned. After 9-12 feet distance, the static was so bothersome that if the CSR had answered, I'd not have been able to conduct business. I tried moving it closer and at different angles with varying results and little improvement. Static wasn't noticed as a background noise or white noise type, but direct distortion of voice and or background music (I was on hold a while), it changed with the volume/beat of the sound I was supposed to be hearing clearly. To say the least, right now I'm not pleased; I truly like the feel, fit, weight and appearance of this headset. There is a notable creak from the flexible portion but nothing I will notice after a few days of using something. The button position for those used to the BT500, as I am, is a little different as it is a bit harder to tap the answer/end button, for you can't really just pinch the end of the mic area and catch the button, as you can with the BT500, but those are small things and a few days of playing will pan out if they become larger issues. I've worn wired headsets for years, mostly Plantronic or Jabra versions'; so moving to BT has been a learning experience. I'm not going to give up on the BT5020 just yet, I'm going to further test it over the weekend, at work where I'll have multiple other phones and radios on or around my person, at times talking on various radios of various frequencies. I think this will truly tell me if the BT5020 can hold mustard, or if it gets packed up on Monday and sent back, something I'm usually ill tolerant of doing unless something is truly truly broken and/or a turd.",neutral,1.0
"I own two different Motorola Headsets, and with both of them, I get frequent complaints that the person I'm calling can't hear me clearly. It may be that I have a very wide face, and the microsphone is too far from my mouth. I'm not really sure why, but regardless, I've been looking for a new headset. I heard about the Jawbone's remarkable noise cancellation features, and thought perhaps it might solve the problem by doing a better job of picking out my voice from surrounding. It didn't. In fact, it's the worst headset I've ever used. Never mind the fact that it's cheaply made. Never mind that the buttons are too stiff and hard to use. Never mind that the ear hook is a real pain to get over my ear... All these things might be forgiven. The real problem is that it simply doesn't work for me. I initially spent a bit of time trying out the different earbuds and hooks to find a combination that would give the voice sensor good contact with my face, as I had heard that this was an important factor. I then tried a few (unfair) experiments to see how it worked. I called myself on my land line, and I got feedback when held the handset in the normal position on my off ear. When I covered the mouthpiece, the feedback went away, but I still got poor sound quality. I thought that perhaps the sound conducting through my head from the handset might be confusing the noise reduction, so I put my land line on speakerphone. I got an interesting reverb effect which indicated that the noise suppression didn't work well when it was trying to suppress my voice on a time delay, but again, this wasn't a fair test. So I called someone. They kept asking if I was there. I kept repeating myself. Apparently, I dropped in and out, and when I wasn't talking, the line was totally silent, without the usual slight background noise that cues the person on the other end that you're still there. I tried calling several different people. I tried adjusting the position of the earpiece. Uniformly, the people I called reported that my voice kept dropping out. I'll be returning my Jawbone tomorrow and resuming my search for a headset that works for me.",negative,1.0
"I tried. I really, really tried. But this system is absolutely worthless in my situation. For background, I have held an Amateur Radio (HAM) license since I was in my teens (have held my Extra class for more than a dozen years). I have even written articles on antennas for the monthly Amateur Radio magazine. In other words, I think I know a little bit about how these things work. That said, I have been totally unsuccessful in getting this cell phone amplifier to work for me. First, the outside antenna (the flat panel) is worthless. Flimsy plastic unit that sits in a box you mount on the house or a tree. Supposed to be directional, but really hard to get it properly aimed. But, more important, the amplifier just doesn't work. For one thing, the amplification varies widely--from full scale, to no signal at all. Imagine how successful you can be making a call when the signal fluctuates that much. Also, the amplifier does not transmit a 3G (let alone 4G) signal. I can stand on the one corner of our front porch where we get limited signal and see one bar of 3G service. However, when I move inside and put the phone directly in front of the inside antenna, I don't even see 1X. Tried it with more than one phone (different brands)--same issues. I had a nice chat with one of the Wilson techs--he was quite pleasant and even sent me the better outside directional antenna at no charge. Helped by getting a little stronger signal (still fluctuates a lot). However, the unit is still unusable and it won't transmit 3G. So, I give up. It's obviously well past the return period and the warranty has expired. My fault. Suffice to say that I am very, very disappointed with this purchase and would not recommend it to others.",negative,1.0
"The product did not work for me. For some reason, I always got a light sequence which was not listed in the manual. Not knowing what the sequence meant, I could not find the means to correct it. I called tech support several times, explaining the sequence and asking what it meant. They only told me to be sure there was sufficient height distance between the antenna and the base unit, which I did but to no avail. I was not impressed with tech support. For the amount of money the unit cost, I expected more help. Regardless, I tried everything the manual suggested and several ideas of my own, including taking the unit to a two story house several blocks away and installing it there. In every situation, the unit gave the same odd sequence. Perhaps it was just a faulty unit but it would have been nice if tech would have been able to tell me that. I finally returned it for a refund (that was good) but still have lousy cell phone reeception (that is bad).",negative,1.0
"I bought this Sept 8, 2016 and it was great! I loved it. I could moderately use it throughout the day and still have 30-40% left when I went to bed. Fast forward to about a month ago, I noticed the case fitting a little weird. The sides were bowed out. I didn't think much of it, maybe the plastic was getting loose from wear. A week or so ago I noticed the sides where the case was bowing wasn't because it was loose; the glass screen was lifting up. I searched trusty google for an answer to no avail. Today I noticed it was worse and searched again for a solution. Turns out the battery is swollen and was pressing on the glass. I can't say this is all PowerBear's fault. It may have been that I dropped it and it damaged something in the battery. But I'm within the two year warranty so I'll see if they're willing to help me.",negative,1.0
"I bought those to replace my LG HBS-730 after they started freaking out on my and were out of warranty. I decided I might as well try the Motorola Buds in case they were more resistant to sweat, see I run with those things on. Well I regret my purchase now, the Buds start freaking out after mile 2, as soon as I start sweating a little, it doesn't take much. The volume and skip buttons stop responding or press themselves without user input and the power button stops working. The buds start working again once they dry out but the second part of your run is screwed. In addition to that the Buds themselves are a little narrow and stiff, which means putting them on makes you worried about splitting them apart. To add insult to injury the power button is placed in the worst possible place, in the center back and on the underside which is very awkward to operate if you have them on. You kinda have to take them on and off to turn them on or off. Bad bad bad design. I might have to buy LG again even though they ended up dying but they lasted months before they were irreparably damaged by sweat (I'm assuming) compared to the Buds which started failing immediately but do come back to life when dry (which is why they get two stars instead of one).",negative,1.0
