I bought these and was excited about them. After a short time though the headband broke. I complained and was eventually sent a new pair. They told me the first batch was bad. A month or so later the headband started to crack again. I wouldn't buy these again which is sad since they have the best sound and bluetooth connectivity but the headband cracks and it stops working.,connectivity,neutral,neutral

"You know it's funny, I almost didn't buy this phone because there were so many negative comments, but all in all I've been very happy with it. Usually the signal is great, service is helpful (I've been with Nextel for 2+ years and never had a problem), sound quality is good... The buttons are a bit recessed, but I haven't found that to be a problem. I've seen complaints about getting the battery cover on/off, and plugging it in to the charger - I've had no problems. As for the GPS, even professional units (I do this as part of my job) do not always get a good signal, cannot work from inside, and sometimes take a half an hour for the satellites to be high enough in the horizon to be of use. It changes day to day - there's a website you can go to that will tell you when the best PDOP (good satellite coverage) will be. The more satellites there are, the more accurate your locations will be. My only complaint was that the day after I bought my phone, a tower was down, which meant I wasn't able to make any calls for a couple of days. Very frustrating, but it was over a holiday weekend (I called on the Saturday before Labor Day), so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. All in all, I've been happy with the purchase so far - it's NOT that heavy, the battery lasts 2-3 times longer than my old phone... All told, I would buy it again.",connectivity,positive,positive
The selling agent of this mobile set was a foul and gave me a defective set. Battery was always low after the full charge and could not be used for international sim card. I strongly suggest to avoid this set from this seller. Later the seller gave 50 percent of the money back but it is no use and a wastage of my time and money,battery,negative,negative
"The Virginmobile payment non-plan plan can be good for those who use a mobile phone infrequently, which I do. It could be terrible for those who use it most days. After getting used to the interface, this can be a likeable phone. If you happen to be where the signal is strong, clarity can be excellent. However, even well within the service area I have had weak signals and broken calls. That's not surprising in the building where I work. That building isn't kind to cell phones, and this phone doesn't take kindly to buildings. It is surprising to get a weak signal in my apartment. There are no roaming fees, because there is normally no connectivity outside Sprint's digital service area. According to the manual 911 calls can connect in the roaming areas. I have not tested this. I found battery life to be disappointing. In standby the 1000mAH battery supplied was only good for about two days between charges. I bought the optional 1700mAH battery from Audiovox. It's twice as thick as the standard battery, and it extends standby to three days between charges. That might not be the fault of Audiovox. With Sprint providing a weak signal where I live and where I work, the phone uses more power to stay in contact with it. I thought that voice volume was too low, and raising level to 5 through the menu was not sufficient. I finally figured out that using the external volume switch during a call can bring it up. I previously rated this phone two stars, but I am upgrading it to a three in this revised review. With weak signals in too many places, I can't rate it higher. I have recently experimented with Cingular. I would definitely rate Virginmobile superior to Cingular.",battery,neutral,neutral
"I'm ranking this 4 stars against the other phones that verizon has to offer. So the only reason it is 4 stars, its the only pocket pc available from them currently. A Samsung i730 is due out -soon- whatever that means.. but i couldn't wait. The good: +Touch screen phone buttons +Large vibrant color screen +Battery life is great (for me), I noticed someone wrote a review mentioning battery life was bad. That is true if you have Bluetooth on all the time. +Slide out QWERTY keypad that lights up for visability +Microsoft Operating System, and limited versions of Outlook, Excel, Word, Internet Explorer +Ability to write on the screen anywhere with stylus and have it recognize handwriting +SD Memory port +Bluetooth +A decent Digital Camera built in +Ability to get POP3 or IMAP email (unlike proprietary palm or blackberry) +Plays mp3's and media with media player 9 +Terminal services The Bads: -Internet Explorer revision is 4.0 and it is locked by default so i cant install an update. -Cant seem to install software easily or the phone is completely locked from putting anything non verizion on it. -Handwriting recognition is fair at best. It seems to recognize cursive better than manuscript. I've tried to customize the letter menu to how i write, but after spending a hour doing so, it worked worse than it did with defaults. -Cant use MP3 ringtones, must be .mid or .wav (what were they thinkin on .wav??? if you cant do mp3) -Bluetooth kills battery life -No 802.11x wireless -Screen Scratches fairly easy The Ugly: --Had it lock up a couple times where i couldn't do anything and had to pull the battery. --Earpiece on phone is not very loud --Ringers are not hardly noticible in volume If there were any other options pocket pc wise on Verizon, I would definately look in to them. But this is the only thing they have and its better than blackberry and palm, even with its problems. I love the email abilities of this phone, and the scheduling is great, plus you can link up to your PC and sync them. I can live with the various glitches here and there, but the ringer and earpiece volume is something they didn't think through so well. A speakerphone would have also been nice. The phone does have some great portable features in excel, word and the browser isn't too bad. Its fairly quick browsing internet considering its using the standard phone network. But the browser does limit you to what kinds of sites you can go to because of its 4.0 revision. One thing I thought was pretty nifty is the terminal services or remote desktop client thats built in. I was able to log in on one of my web servers and poke around. This phone definately has some good features and some irritating qualities. So until Verizon releases the Samsung pocket pc, I have to rate this the best phone they offer.",audio,positive,positive
"OK. everyone, stop crying like little babies and follow my instruction on this cheap charger. The charger I got has 3 light and I do not know how to operate any other charger that has 4 lights. The box did not even have model number, so just go by 3 led lights if you wish to use my instruction. 1. Be careful not to break or bend the electrods in the charger. 2. Get your reading glsses on so that you can see whether charger electrodes are touching battery electrodes. 3. Adjust the clear plastic handle so that left (label in +)charger electrode touches left battery electrode; it doesn't matter whether it is + or - at this point. 4. Adjust the other plastic handle so that it right charger (label it -) electrode touches right battery electrode. NOW IT YOU GOT THE CONNECTION AND POLARITY RIGHT, THE LEFT CHARGER LED LIGHT WILL COME ON RED. IF IT DOES NOT WORK, THEN MAKE SURE THE BOTH CHARGER ELECTRODES ARE TOUCHING BOTH BATTERY ELECTRODS. IF IT STILL DOESN'T LIGHT, THEN TURN YOUR BATTERY AND TRY IT AGAIN. (If you have enough power then right led light will light green) 5. When LEFT charger led lights red, that means it is connected and ready to charge. 6. Plug it in. Then the CENTER led light will start blinking, meaning it is charging. 7. Be patient; mine took 24 hours. 8. When it is fully charged, the RIGHT led light will turn green and the center red light will go off. It is cheap but it works. Then again if I have to do it again, I would have spent few more dollars and get the charger that has plastic casing that is specifically made for my cell phone battery.",battery,neutral,neutral

So like another reviewer mentioned I would be driving down the road with the headset in one ear and my phone on the other. The headset falls out often. I have a bigger then usual ear I guess, but still. Other headsets are adjustable in one way or another, this one is not. After a month of only periodic use, the sound quality has become horrible.

"I've had cellular phones since they first came out in a BAG with a full-size handset. This is the worsed performer of all I've ever owned. Motorola has sent two V600 replacements (thanks to my service plan)and the same problem of dropped calls or no antenna persists. In any given location, the antenna strength drops to nothing or calls just drop off. A 'trick' I've figured out to get antenna signal back is to call my Service Provider's number and allow it to fail...this fills up the antenna strength! Go Figure! Some features of the phone are pretty cool, such as the outside color lights, the clarity of the inside screen, or the camera features; but all-in-all the main use of the phone needs antenna signals to work. It's frustrating especially when you are on a business call or talking to someone you simply do NOT want to hang up on! I'll sum it up by quoting my Service Provider's comments, when he said, ""I get so many problem calls with the V600, that we should be answering the phone saying, 'V600 Service Help Line'.""",camera,negative,negative
"Only been using it for a day or two. First thoughts is it is smaller physically than the Zero Lemon version but rated higher mah. Nice that it doesn't block the speaker. Nice case. I don't understand the reasons for the critical reviews, I have used extended batteries for years mostly the zero lemon, this battery is definitely an upgrade to the oem. My s5 wouldn't get through a whole day of phone calls, Pandora, email, Facebook, and maybe a little Hulu streaming. With ANY extended battery I have owned I can do all these things and still have 30% or more battery life at the end of the day. Sometimes even go for 2 days! Now if I don't do all those things and I'm in a good service area then the battery will last 3 days. If you really don't notice any improvement over your OEM battery then either you got a lemon or something else is going on. Wouldn't be surprised if the Zero lemon guys are leaving bad reviews because Powerbear's 2 year warranty is far beyond their 180 days. Honestly Zero lemon feels like a cheap knockoff compared to my experience with the powerbear so far. Update: after using this for a month I can say it is not as long lasting as advertised. The zero lemon lasted twice as long. No other problems just not worth 5 stars.",accessories,neutral,neutral

"Not sure if this phone is still offered widely out there anymore, but thought I'd add my experiences with it for anyone now considering purchasing it. I've had this phone for a little over a year now. At first, it was a dream to use. The full QWERTY keypad inside makes texting a breeze. The phone has a pleasing slim design, and call quality is always satisfactory. Then the problems began. About six months into use the front keypad stopped working. Basically the phone has an auto key lock feature that you have to press the ""ok"" key to disable, but eventually the ""ok"" key became non-functional. After researching on the internet, I found that this is a widespread problem affecting many other users. Ultimately you have to open the phone every time you want to use it which leads me into the next problem... After about a year of normal use, one of the hinges has cracked and the phone will not stay fully closed. It's probably only a matter of time before the other hinge breaks due to the added stress caused by the dislodged hinge popping out of its socket. Another minor issue is that the chrome sides wear away, giving the phone a worn ragged look on the exterior, but this is purely cosmetic. So overall, my experience with this phone is that it is not built to quality standards that will allow it function as designed through your 2-year wireless service contract. It's a shame, because I loved this model when I first started using it. Now I can't wait for the 6-months I have remaining in my contract to pass so I can get a new (functional) phone.",build_quality,negative,negative

"I own this Wilson cell phone booster at work and a Wi-Ex cell phone booster at home. As they state clearly in their documentation and online descriptions you need some signal which it amplifies. Where I use these there is like ""one bar"" reception and the boosters work to a limited degree but call quality is poor some of the time. So I have kept looking for a better solution. Many involve compromises like getting an alternate phone number. But what works best for me because I have a decent broadband Internet connection and have a limited number of phones to boost and I'm an AT&T customer (others may have similar devices) is the AT&T 3G MicroCell which doesn't boost a weak cell signal but uses the Internet instead. So far it is working much better than the boosters I have bought. And it costs less (I paid $150) and there is an optional monthly unlimited minutes fee too if you need it. Having spent about $500 on cell phone signal boosters I'm glad there are alternatives out there that may be better for some applications.

"I live in a Mobile Home which has additional insulation and siding on the exterior as well as Energy Star windows with additional storm windows. As a result, the cell phone signal in my home is very weak. I have Sprint as a carrier and get a weak Sprint signal outside the home but no sprint signal inside the home. I do have a very weak Verizon signal inside the home so I could receive some phone calls inside the home but only if the phone was next to window and hooked up to charger. If the phone was not on the charger, the battery would drain within 24 hours because it was constantly searching for signal. After missing several calls and getting tired of having to go outside to make a call I had to do something. It was either pay the penalty for early termination for 2 phones with Sprint or purchase a Cell Phone Signal Booster. I opted to purchase the booster after reading several reviews on Amazon. The fact that I had 30 days to return it if it did not work made this an easy choice. I received the Wilson Signal Booster less than one week after I ordered it. I pointed the antenna toward my nearest Sprint tower and ran the included cable into my home. Within 30 minutes of opening the box, I was ready to try it out. The results were unbelievable. I now have full signal from Sprint anywhere in my home. I can make calls and receive calls with absolutely no problem.

"This is one of those products where the anticipation is better than the ownership. The BT800 ""Borg implant"" seemed like a good headset based on the available on-line literature, but it doesn't measure up in practice. Design: B-, an oversized, overly complicated device.

USB charging a plus. Aesthetics: C, it's all function, no form, but not a total eyesore. Build quality: D+, materials are cheap and construction is very flimsy; outer ""jog wheel"" can easily break off. Buttons are rubbery and lack tactile feedback. Comfort: F, the most uncomfortable headset ever! The heavy weight and poor ear clip shape make this headset painful to wear. The overly-articulated ear clip and large size make for an impossibly floppy fit. Compatibility: A, no problems pairing or using this headset. Full handsfree functionality is available, if difficult to learn and use. Caller ID works flawlessly. Outbound sound quality: B-, callers can hear me OK, but onboard DSP can sometimes make the voice very ""choppy"" to the caller, especially in noisier environments. Noise cancellation is fair.

I mostly use this stereo headset to listen to the Bible while commuting to work on my motor scooter. My open face helmet gives me just enough room to adjust the volume, pause, or answer a call with my index finger. Since the earbuds are noise reducing, the sound of the motor is muffled and I don't have to turn up the volume as much as I did with my other set. The result is that I can still hear traffic around me fairly well; which is critical to anyone on a two wheeled vehicle.

"While the Pearl shows potential, I am planning to return mine to AT&T within my 30-day evaluation period. This little BlackBerry shows a lot of promise but comes up short as being a reliable phone. This is my first BlackBerry, and even with its marvelous email functionality (bundled with AT&T's $29.99 data plan), I find this device cheaply built and finicky to use. The durability of this unit leaves a lot to be desired. Like some of the cheapest phones on the market this unit features weak flimsy plastic casing. The unit feels like a toy in your hand, especially when removing the battery cover. An optional MicroSD card goes in this area so the battery compartment will need to be accessed over time. Basic phone use is a problem. Battery life is nothing exciting. Like many other phones, the ring volume and call volume just isn't very loud, even at maximum. In noisy areas it becomes hard to have a normal phone call. The ringtone will not play simultaneously while the unit vibrates, so calls are often missed. Historically this has plagued all BlackBerry's. The ""Vibrate+Tone"" mode causes 1-3 vibrations before the ringtone begins. RIM has stated this may be fixed in upcoming units. Answering a call becomes even more difficult using AT&T's OEM leather case. The phone must be pulled out of the case before it can be used; the case has no holes for access while sheathed, or leaving the included headphone plugged in. Safely answering a call in a hands-free manner is near impossible and should not be performed with this phone especially if driving a car. One of the features I was most excited about was the browser. While it offers some basic functionality, it is unable to utilize 90% of what's on the web. Most web sites will not function in this Java based browser, which does not begin to touch what might be accomplished on a device such as an iPhone. Graphics, sounds, music, animation, and Flash all don't work on the Pearl. You can do things like get directions and perform basic Google searches, which remains very useful, but forget any ""fun"". If you can live with the cheap plastic build quality and are in need of email functionality in a small package you might want to consider this phone. Personally I cannot live with a device that is built like a toy and misses so many calls due to simple things like speakers that aren't loud enough and ringtones that cannot happen while the phone vibrates.",performance,negative,negative
"I wanted to love this phone but it was not to be. First of all, the phone is pretty much as advertised. It is very basic, easy to use and physically small. It looks to be rugged and will most likely stand up to hard use. All the features (not many, I realize) are easily accessible. The sound quality and speaker phone are excellent. In summary, it's a no-nonsense phone for people who only want to make/receive calls and send/receive the occasional text message. Now the bad. In 2.5 months of use, the phone dropped many calls. Sometimes, the phone does not ring during incoming calls and the caller is sent straight to the voice mailbox. In those cases, due to a glitch with AT&T, there is nothing displayed on the phone to signify that a call was missed or a voice mail is waiting for you. You have no clue unless you call your voice mail so you must do this quite regularly to check for missed voice mails. I realize this may be a glitch with AT&T and may not apply to other carriers. Sometimes, calling the phone returns a message that service is temporarily unavailable in that area. I have no idea if this is the phone's fault but since the phone returns zero bars from time to time and drops calls, I have to assume the problems may be related. One may claim that some of these problems aren't the phone's fault. I can only respond that I have had a Nokia 6061 for years and under the same conditions, it has never dropped a call or exhibited any of these problems, so no matter what is causing the problems, the result is that the Motofone is not as useful or reliable as the Nokia. You may ask, with all these problems, why give it 2 stars? Simply because the design of the phone is unique and a breath of fresh air as compared to other cell phones. I'd gladly buy another such phone if the problems were cleared up and I hope they will be in time.",accessories,negative,negative

"This phone has a lot of features but is quirky. The phone comes with the battery, travel charger, and user guide only. You have to purchase the headset (mono or stereo), holster, micro SD card, etc separately. Pros: 1. Speakerphone is loud and fairly clear, but could definitely use some improvement. 2. MP3 player's sound quality is okay but should never be compared to a full-fledged MP3 player. 3. Digital photo quality is good, albeit a slightly slower than instant response. 4. Menus are simple. 5. This slider phone is large enough for my hands, but sleek and elegant enough to get the oohs and ahhs from others. Cons: 1. MP3 player cannot play all MP3 files. There are some rules that Samsung had built-in that prevents certain files from playing. 2. MP3 music stored in the micro SD card cannot be associated with any incoming calling group or person. To associate personal music as a ringtone, you'd have to convert the MP3 to an MMF file. This is a multi-step process which seems to be wasted energy. Samsung phones need to improve upon this aspect like other companies. 3. The digital photos that you copy from your personal collection into the micro SD card, cannot be viewed on the phone. 4. Main menus cannot be customized unlike other Samsung phones. 5. One of the most important things is battery life, and this phone doesn't have any. I have two different versions of this phone, the black one and the white one. They both experience the short battery life syndrome. If you play with the phone all day, expect to charge this phone at least once a day. This phone was rated with a 10-day standby time within the digital network. Well, I live, work, and travel within this digital network, and I still have to charge it every 36-48 hours. I've had other Samsung phones that lasted much longer.",performance,negative,negative
"This phone is a pretty good phone; much more liek a phone than the original Blackberry phones. It is about the same size as the TREO 6xx. Here is what I liked about the phone: 1) Push email was really useful. That is when the email automatically gets sent to the phone. 2) The scroll bar was cool and easy to use. 3) Bluetooth was very easy to set up. 4) The browser emulated 4 different browsers; rendering the pages slightly differently but adding functionality with certain emulation. 5) Able to read attachments without extra software. 6) Fairly inexpensive Here is what I didn't like: 1) Big on the waistline; attached to the belt it was a pain. 2) Very little software customization out there. No themes, no 3rd party software that was free. 3) Push mail service and data service was expensive..... 4) No accessories; i.e. cases; docking stations. 5) The syncing was a pain. 6) Can't transfer files via bluetooth only the earpiece was available through bluetooth. All in all this phone is above average I liked it, and if there weren't other pim/smartphones out there I would have kept it. Due to its size, cost, and compatibility I found the Audiovox SMT5600 to be a much smarter buy.",price,neutral,neutral

"The Samsung WEP700 Bluetooth Headset is everything that the manufacturer claims in it's advertising, however, the ""buttonology"" can be a bit awkward to get used to. Pushing the Call button will automatically dial the last person called, while holding the same button down for 2-3 seconds then releasing it will allow you to use voice commands, and the same button held down for just a little longer will shut the unit off. This may cause issues if you keep calling the same number or can't figure out why the voice command feature isn't coming up because you weren't paying attention to the length of time you pressed the call button. If patience (or timing) is not one of your virtues I would look for something that automatically triggers the voice command feature rather than last number called and has a separate on/off switch.",connectivity,neutral,neutral

The leather stitching is also frayed on ALL sides. I however wore this case inside my front pocket.

Because I like to wear my Blackberry Curve phone inside my pocket instead of letting it hang out like a fanny-belt, I decided to get an OEM BB slim case that usually comes with a new Curve phone.

"I've had my share of cell phones. Before getting the LG CU400, I had a Sony/Ericsson 500A. I loved that phone but S/E's Customer Service stunk! (Because of a SyncManager database error, they said I had to reinsall the O/S to fix the problem! Yea, right!!!) The LG CU400 has a progressive ringtone. Right now, you can't change that. From what I understand per LG, Cingular made this an LG-requirement of their phones. It's annoying when I hear someone else's phone do that, especially when no one answers the phone! It doesn't have a quick-lock feature (that I can find.) The Contacts are laid out in a wierd way (to me.) Name1/H, Name1/W, Name1/M, and so on. (H=Home, W=Work, M=Mobile, and so on.) I don't know if that's because the data was on the SIM and isn't 'loaded' into the phone, itself, yet, or what. I do like the location of the speaker button - a one-touch feature. When the phone is closed, pressing any button on the side will display the date/time. It's not in color - No biggie. It's a PTT (Push-To-Talk) phone. (I didn't buy that capability ...) When you dial a phone number, the numbers are pretty big. It has an external antenna. My last phone had an internal antenna. I didn't buy insurance in case I drop it and it breaks, or something. It's possible that can happen. It's not a Razor but it's thin. The internal display is very clear! I let the fully-charged phone run out the battery and, twice, it's lasted only 4 days with very minimal use. Your call history is a couple of buttons down the menu-path, no biggie. The speaker gets fuzzy at about 4 out of 7 bars. You can't accidentally take pictures of inside your pocket or handbag. I don't use the download capabilities of the phone for anything. I don't IM. I just use the phone as a phone. So, I'm not going to comment on those features. The 'door' that needs to be opened for charging is very flimsy! I can see it breaking off very easily. You'll want to 'turn' it 90 degrees UP to get it out of the way of the charger-cable. There's no holster, yet, because it's so new. There is a data-cable that can be used from another phone, so I'm told. Be sure to ask about the peripheral hardware BEFORE you buy in case you need to have it right away. All the peripherals may not be available yet. In sum, it's not a bad phone. The ascending ring, the external antenna, and the fuzzy speaker, so far, hold me from giving this phone a Rating of 4. It's above average but I don't think it deserves a 4. I'll try the phone for a while and then try the Samsung C417. It's all about tradeoffs.",screen,neutral,neutral

"To be honest, for me the fit was a secondary problem. One other person at least mentioned this, but I think the hyper-sensitivity of the switch is a worse problem. Why? Because you can't store the unit anywhere on your person without activating/deactivating the switch. In your pocket? It will activate all the time. A holster, they are all too snug and will push the switch. On your head all day? Well, assuming you could tolerate it you will have to adjust it from time to time, which means touching that darn switch (it covers the entire surface of the unit as it is under the cover). There is no safe place to touch or hold this unit in practical terms without hitting a switch! As for fit, I found that if you wear glasses the fit is OK (at least for me) if you use your glasses arm to wedge it against your check. All that said; I am desperate for a really great headset that handles wind, noise, fits solidly, uses mini usb plugs (not this non-standard charger) and all the other items that everybody seems to want. I am going to return the Jawbone 2 (which also had mysterious dead moments anyway) and wait for the Sound ID 300 even though their earlier device didn't get the best reviews. The Motorola 710 sounds practical, but no doubt won't solve the noise/wind problems as I don't think it has DSP. There simply doesn't seem to be a killer unit yet. My Gennum NX6000 had good noise cancellation, but fell off all the time and they aren't even in the business anymore. This is depressing, but the Jawbone 2 (made in China, by the way, for folks who care about country of origin) won't make you feel better, I'm afraid. It certainly didn't brighten my day. UPDATE: I got lazy and kept this too long to return. I made a case for it with a wooden post inside to keep it from going on. The sound quality is OK. The little earpiece loops keep breaking (I'm on my 2nd to last). Maybe I should have given this three stars because it basically functions fine, but sometimes the ergonomics and quality of construction just annoy you so much, if you know what I mean. BTW, I tested this against a Nokia BH-905 that I got for $15 with rebate (one in each ear) and except for background noise it wasn't much better. A similar test against the Plantronics Pro in a store showed it about even in quality so Plantronics is catching up with these guys, but I couldn't justify another expensive purchase while this thing lingers on (at least it keeps working).",audio,negative,neutral

"I use this for my job as a field technician out in the Texas heat. I sweat a lot. My old bluetooth headset is plantronics ATT V521. That design kept it off of my head and dry from my perspiration. The V510 on the otherhand will have a large surface area directly on the side of your head and it collects a lot of sweat and moisture. My unit failed after about 2 weeks and this might be the reason why, or maybe it was defective. I sent it back and got a refund. I went back to using my old V521. If you work in hot areas or you expect to sweat all day, the V510 design is not a good choice. On the other hand, The V510 stays on your ear firmer and is more comfortable than the V521.

"This is a nice looking case cover and the material seems very durable. The side pocket is large enough to carry a few standard-sized (e.g. Carl Fischer) books, a reed case, etc. My main complaint is that the case cover will not stand stably on its four posts (feet). The bottom edge of the bag is not rigid enough and the posts tend to fold inward. The cover fits snugly around my Buffet Attache-style case, which is both good and bad. The good is that the case does not slide around within. The bad is that it makes opening the case nearly impossible without first removing it from the cover. Also, the zippers rub the corners of the case and I'm always concerned that the zippers may mar its leather. There is little room in the main compartment for anything besides the clarinet case. Another pocket would be nice for a clarinet stand or a spare mouthpiece. All in all, this case cover does its primary job well.

Changeable faceplates gives the phone a customizable touch. Ring tones sound a bit fuzzy with the phone open it seems but when shut sound fine. A very odd variety of ring tones as well.

"PMK 5800 cannot be used in populated areas. The product is designed and engineered very well. I think this is a very clever idea. Its dimensions fit my car (Audi A4 2006) perfectly. Nice lighted controls, easy setup. PMK 5800 picked up my AT&T Tilt voice recognition with no additional setup. However, there is a fatal problem in this design - you cannot use it in populated areas with lots of FM stations. I live 60 miles from Boston. Every odd FM channel here is taken. Even channels in between deliver a lot of interference from surrounding odd channels. No matter what you do - you cannot beat the FM environment around you. PMK 5800 has a weak FM transmitter so the better audio system you have the less chance you get any recognizable sound out of PMK 5800. It delivers an overwhelming background noise. Forget MP3 music playback. Simple design change could alter the future of this product - ability to output through its already existent mini USB port. With this capability PMK 5800 could be integrated through cassette player adapters or directly through vehicle's stereo system.

"There is nothing great about the Motorola V600. It's pretty much a typical cell phone with some features that are supposed to make your life easier. I've had this phone for over a month now and here's what I've discovered I hate about it. My biggest gripe with the V600 is the side buttons. When the phone is closed, the side buttons are still active, and they change the ring style. Since I carry it in my pocket, I've had plenty of instances with the ringer being turned off, to vibrate, or to loud accidentally. This is a huge usability flaw in my opinion. Normally the side buttons are inactive when a flip phone is closed. Not the case here. Another problem area is the phone book. I can't believe they make new cell phones that can't store multiple numbers with a single name. I have one person in my phone 5 times (home1, home2, work, cell, and pager). This is really annoying when trying to find names. Furthermore, when storing to the SIM card, you can't store additional information like Category, Voice, and Picture. You can only use these features when storing to the phone, which defeats the whole idea of a SIM card in that if you change phones, you need to reprogram all the numbers again. One aspect of the phone I did end up liking was the design aesthetics. It's a pretty cool looking phone and the external display glows blue. It also has three rings around the Motorola logo that glow when the phone alerts you to a call. However, the choice of material here is questionable. The back batter cover is a stamped metal piece that is extremely slick. I've literally dropped this phone when my hands had a little moisture on them (remember I live in Arizona). So I like what it looks like, but not what it's made out of. Other features that this phone has are a calendar, web access, Bluetooth integration, calculator, voice recording, camera, video viewing capability, and instant messaging. These features all work fine, but once again, there's nothing special about them. It seems that Motorola designers spent most of their time and energy in creating a phone that has completely customizable menus. You can rearrange menu items and configure hot keys to do pretty much anything. The first thing I did was set my configuration to my liking, but have not changed them since, so all the time and effort spent developing the interface was pretty much useless for me after the first hour. The reason I chose, and plan on keeping, this phone is because my brother works for Motorola and it was the highest-end phone that he could get for free. Guess I got what I paid for. I use my V600 on a T-Mobile account. So to recap, if you have other choices when it comes to choosing a phone, it might be a better idea to get the other phone. There's nothing great about the V600, but if you just want a phone to make and receive calls, it works just fine. Sound quality, included accessories, ring tones, and battery life are all up to par.",build_quality,negative,neutral

Keyboard is amazingly easy to handle and has a very good feel. The best screen so far in terms of size and and technology (TFT).

"A solidly built, multifunctional device with an ingenious interface... Too bad the whine of electronic interference from your car will most likely destroy the sound quality. A ground loop adapter can eliminate this noise on your end (what you hear from the stereo), but only at the cost of eliminating the bass from your music. As for the person you are trying to have a phone conversation with; they're just completely out of luck. This would easily get 5 stars were it not for this problem, but due to this issue, I can only give it 3. I've since replaced it with an Acoustic Research ARWH1 unit, which does a better job in terms of both call and music quality despite not even being designed as a car kit, and doesn't suffer from ground loop issues even when plugged into the car's power outlet.",build_quality,neutral,neutral
"This is my fourth or fifth Bluetooth headset. I had one or more of the following three problems with all my previous Bluetooth headsets: 1. Poor sound quality: Person on the other end said my voice was very soft or sounded like I was on a bad speakerphone with a loud echo. 2. Poor volume: The speaker volume in my ear was too soft for me to hear well even with the volume cranked all the way up. 3. Very slow to connect: Took 3-4 seconds to pick up a call and the person on the other end of the line was always saying ""Hello, hello?"" This Bluetooth headset has NONE of the above listed problems. It is very clear and loud for me and I've yet to have a single person say they couldn't year me well or that they got an echo when talking to me(been using it now for about 5 months). I speak in a normal voice without having to yell into the mic. It also picks up calls very quickly. It beeps three times and I can talk right away, no delay. It is also comfortable, I can wear it for multiple hours without discomfort. I like it so much I'll use it in my car even though my car has the Bluetooth connectivity so I can talk and hear the caller through the speakers. Also, the battery life is great. I went on a fishing trip for 4 days and it worked the whole time without a recharge. The only slight con is that the part that goes around the back of your ear is quite large. It isn't the most visually appealing headset out there. I feel it is a small price to pay for it working how I want it to. Bottom line: Works like you would expect it to and has finally made Bluetooth headsets usable for me.",price,positive,positive
This is my first Bluetooth headset and i am pretty much contented with what its offering. Compatible with my mobile phone Motorola v600 and Razr V3. I normaly use it while driving and the voice is quite clear on both ends. The only problem i see is the headset doesnt hold much battery power. It needs to be recharged quite often. The headset is quite bulky as you can feel it in your ears. Bluetooth headsets are not in market for a long time so i don't expect much either. Overall a good handset.,price,neutral,neutral

"I ""upgraded"" from an old nokia 6010 that was working perfect for over 4 years to a LG cu500 That can't even stay connected for more than a minute! Dropped calls like crazy. People on the other end keep hanging up on me because they could not hear me! HELLO? HELLO? HELLO? And the 3G Hipe that cingular keeps pushing is NO GOOD as well. I signed up for the full media package with video and all the bells and whistles and the video would go into buffer zone forever after playing about 15 seconds of a 3 min clip. This was my second CU500 phone from cingular. New sim card, new phone, same problems. My signal was always 5 bars strong in the 3g mode, yet, still dropped calls and nobody could hear me. My best guess about this phone is that LG rushed this phone to market to compete with the razor from motorola.(As we all know that the razor is always sold out at the cingular stores.) I would not recommend this phone to anybody who needs a reliable source of communication. Cell phone quality has dropped in the last 4 years since I brought a phone, so I can't really recommend any brands. Cingular service has been PERFECT so far before I brought this phone so go figure what's the problem.

"Love the looks, and the bluetooth headset rocks! But, when you pay 200 bucks for a phone it should be of very good quality. I read reviews here where people stated static/hum was a problem but I thought possibly they had received defective units. When I received the first phone it had a bad static hum. I use dsl, had the dsl filter installed, I disconnected the phone line and activated the handset and it still hummed. Thinking this may be line noise being generated by some device on this circuit, I plugged it into a different circuit, same thing. My old phone still works but with very low volume and I did not have this hum. Sent the unit back for a different one. The new one had the same problem, albeit not quite as bad at first, but within a week the problem progressed to the same level as the first phone. I returned the second unit also and will try something different. Now for my rant :) This product has a defective electronic component that is causing this static/hum, or a design flaw that doesn't handle normal electrical line noise. Because some reviews give this thing very high praise, but others do not, this leads me to believe that possibly Plantronics had units that were manufactured using a bad component or design, that they later resolved in new units, but are not pulling the defective/bad units from the market, and instead, are still selling them hoping people will just accept it. I'm not one of those who will, and in fact I will never buy Plantronics products again because they must be aware of this issue and are not being proactive in ensuring they are selling quality products. Far too common a practice these days. If you buy this, good luck.",audio,negative,negative

"I bought a Treo 650 completely unlocked because I live outside US, first it was good, everything worked fine UNTIL I started using the phone for the first time. It's really painly to use, because keys are very tiny and it's very easy to press what you don't want, besides that, even when I was using anti-scratch films on the screen, it always was dirty because when you use the phone against your head to speak it gets dirty with marks of your ear. But as this wasn't completely painfull, the phone got locked once a week at least, sometimes I tried to make a call and it just didn't dialed until you turned it off and on again, like a soft reset, sometimes I was using an application and it just turned off and on again without hesitate or asking, I really NOT recommend buying this equipment nor Amazon or any other online or physical store.",screen,negative,negative
"I purchased one of these for use with an iPhone 3Gs. It has been an acceptable headset, though the audio quality isn't great (but I've used few other headsets and therefore can't really compare).

This one uses longer, richer audio cues; they sound pretty, but the length is bothersome to me when I fumble the headset on to catch a call, knowing that the caller is dealing with two more ring cycles while the headset plays the startup chime. I also haven't been able to find a carrying case for this form-factor of headset, which is irritating. I worry it will get mashed up in my pocket.",price,positive,positive

The sound is okay, it has to be relatively quiet around you or it is really difficult to hear through the earpiece. Everyone I talk to doesn't even know I am using it, that is a good sign for the voice pickup. I guess if the volume was a little better, I would have given it another star, but it is what it is. The price is good if you are just looking for a headset to use occasionally, but if you are going to use it for a long time, I would recommend a different setup.

"I'm not someone who finds himself phone shopping very often, and really liked my last Nokia... but it went thru the wash and wasn't salvageable. So I went shopping. I hate the phones the networks have at the stores, I wanted something different, something with pizazz! I really love this phone - smaller than anticipated, but very much the scale that I prefer. Key features that I find a 'must have' in any phone is multi number contacts and speakerphone. This does both and then some. I was debating between the blue and the silver - and went with the blue, and I'm glad I did. However, it is very very susceptible to fingerprints, so I highly recommend the BodyGlove Cellsuit to keep it nice and free of smears. This is an unlocked phone, so the keypad and some of the programming is not US only - the dictionary for example is in Chinese I believe. It comes with a wide array of ring tones and the sound quality exceeded expectations. The camera also exceeds expectations and has a picture editor on board - cheesey frames, b&w, brightness, sharpness and sepia - but these functions do eat up battery life quickly. I am very much a Nokia man, and have been hesitant to buy Motorola, but Nokia currently has nothing that interests me, style wise and the 2 gig micro sd ability intrigued me... by the way, have I told you how much I love this phone? I have yet to find a flaw.",audio,positive,positive

"Here's the deal, no bluetooth headset, and for that fact no headset is perfect. Now...with that in mind, let me give a little bit of background. I have had more headsets, cell phones, and other hands free devices in the past few years than most people will have in a lifetime. I have poor hearing due to numerous surgeries on my ears and have found that while I can headsets are great for me when I'm in a completely quiet environment. Having said all of that, I bought the BT800 about 3 weeks ago after reading numerous reviews from a plethora of sources and coming to the conclusion that the vast majority of the comparisons and reviews I read rated this headset as #1. As stated I have had the headset for about 3 weeks. Getting to the functionality...it pairs with my phone and laptop with absolutely no problems/issues. My first few calls left me feeling as if the ear piece could fall off of my ear at any point in time, however after wearing it longer and longer and making hours of calls I have found that the headset is surprisingly sturdy. The inbound audio is remarkable, and when compared to nearly if not every other headset I've ever had, it's the best. The microphone is nearly ""too good"" and it took me numerous phone calls to finally figure out that the microphone is so sensitive that you have to position the headset so that the microphone is pointing sideways or even a little upward (not down towards your mouth). Getting to the point I spend about 2 - 6 hours a day on my cell phone and would guesstimate that I spend about 3 - 5 of that while using my headset. The headset is comfortable, the audio is great, the microphone is loud, and the DSP works quite well. Bluetooth pairing is a breeze and it took me about 2 minutes (after charging) to set the headset up. The only negatives I have had so far have been with regards to ""voice signal."" I use voice dialing often and have found that when using any means other than the headset my voice dialing software is about 85 - 90 % accurate. When using the headset my initial results were about 20 - 30% accuracy. As I have had the headset for a while I have found a few ways to improve this and would guess that my accuracy via the headset when making voice dialing is now probably around 75 - 85%. It's not perfect, but considering everything else it's really the least of my problems. Overall I would highly recommend this product. I am enclosing a few links to various reviews that I have come across on the web. A few of these have very detailed information that you may find useful with this purchasing decision. 1.

The result is an occasional premature battery failure or less useage times in the bluetooth because it has been ""bluetooth pairing"" off and on all day while you were carrying it. Other than this one quirk, it is a good case to protect and carry your bluetooth. I have yet to find anything like this in cell phone stores.",battery,positive,positive

"This was my first phone. When I was on the market for phones, I was looking for something cool. Something shiny, something unique. The LG Chocolate was about the only thing that looked appealing.

It said it had a good battery life, very easy to use, and the only con was that its a fingerprint magnet, and that the touch pad was sensitive. Right? WRONG.

"My gripe with the Jawbone is one that I'm surprised I don't read more about: Unless you want to keep it on your ear 24/7, you've got to carry it on your person somehow. But, if you put it in a pocket, it's way too easy to accidentally push the button that connects the Jawbone to your cellphone. Then when a call arrives, if you pick up the cellphone and answer the car normally, the other person is speaking inaudibly from your pocket! (If it's a short call, I don't bother with the Jawbone. If it's a longer call, I put the Jawbone on in order to talk handsfree.) What is needed is some kind of case or holster that envelopes the Jawbone and is rigid enough to resist outside pressures that would inadvertently trigger a connection. Incredibly, the Jawbone site says: ""We do not offer carrying cases for the Jawbone. Furthermore, we cannot recommend a suitable case. We understand that you are concerned about protecting your headset and we wish we could point you in a direction for a carrying case."" Why can't THEY make such a case????

"If you are a serious disc golfer and really want to up your game, a practice basket is a must. The baskets I have priced have either been too cheaply made or too expensive. While this basket is neither cheap or constructed on par with the course baskets, it represents the best price/quality ratio that I have run across. Although the construction of my basket was not meticulous, the top of my basket is visually slightly slanted and the single row medium gauge chains allow a higher percentage of walk throughs than its course grade counterparts, it is solid practice basket. It collapses conveniently, sets up quickly and seems to have a thicker metal gauge than others in its price range. I had previously tried some canvas and plastic targets which I found nearly useless and used friends metal baskets which were either more lightly constructed or pushing $220 in price. There are not a lot of competitors but the DGA brand in my opinion seemed the best deal. When I was initially considering this basket there was a six week projected delivery date that almost discouraged me from buying it. The actual delivery ended up being just a little over two weeks so that was another very pleasant surprise. I try to put in (2) fifteen minutes of putting practice per day and having the convenience of having this basket available 24/7 has made a tremendous difference in my putting percentages. It is one of those seemingly non-essential purchases that I have made that has payed off dividends much greater than anticipated.

"I've gone through 3 of these HS850 headsets; i won't be buying another. My first broke right away (dropped a few inches from my ear to my desk; so fragile!) - so i returned it and found a 2-for-1 sale on all Motorola headsets. I decided to give this model another whirl. The second lasted maybe a week before getting bumped and losing all volume (again, so fragile!). I gave the third to my wife, but she gave it back because it wouldn't stay on her ear. Even that third one lasted only a couple months before the speaker fell so quiet it's pretty much unusable. The ergonomics on this headset are passable - not terribly comfortable, but it's wonderfully lightweight. After a while, i figured out how to crank it on my ear to make it stay in place; handy, but ouch. It paired easily with my Treo 650 and a Blackberry Pearl - but i fought with it constantly trying to pick up calls. The 'multi-function' button seemed to 'sleep' periodically; i'd have to push it several times to reactivate it, which inevitably picked up then hung up the call in quick succession. It does fold up nicely, however, and i never had a problem with battery life. My biggest complaint: LOW VOLUME. There's no echo on these headsets because the speaker couldn't possibly get loud enough to cause one. I kept the volume maxed all the time, and i still had to press it to my ear and shout ""say that again?!"" even inside a quiet office. I also had to cup my hand up to 'bounce' the sound from my mouth to the microphone in order to be heard. And forget trying to talk outside or in a car - wind, traffic, or road noise can cause endless shouting for you and your caller.

Apps like Latitude, My Tracks, and Compass are perfect for those folks but drain the Smart Phone batteries, which makes your charger perfect. At the end of a day of hiking, all the other guys' smartphones were in their trucks charging, while mine was charged and in use by the campfire looking up tomorrows weather and the scores to the games!

"I purchased the Latte Bluetooth Headset to replace my old Jabra BT135 (w/c came free with my phone). I was receiving static problems and would lose connectivity with my old headset even if my phone was just in my pocket. I had thought that the issue was with the Jabra BT135 since I figured it was cheap and free and not meant to last very long. Also, the earhook of my Jabra was starting to break off so it was the perfect excuse to buy a new headset. The Latte Mocha Bluetooth Headset did not correct the issue. I experienced the same problems with static and lose of connectivity. I discovered that the problem was with my phone (SE W580i) which had poor bluetooth capability. And so, I got another phone which seems to have remedied both the Jabra BT135 and the Latte Mocha connectivity issues. I am quite disappointed though with the Latte Mocha since I expected (and wanted) it to perform much better than the Jabra BT135 (which looks like a free piece of plastic). The only thing that the Latte Mocha had going for itself when compared against my free headset was the fact that it was smaller and looked better. Unfortunately, when it came down to performance, the Latter Mocha fell short of expectations that were not very high to begin with considering that I was comparing it against an old headset that I got absolutely free. Here is my comparison: 1. Look - The Latte Mocha takes this category hands down. 2. Feel - The rectangular shape of the Latte Mocha is a nuisance since the corner eats into your ear and starts hurting if you have it on for more than 5 minutes. The Jabra had a better fit and was more comfortable as well. For the Latte Mocha to stay in your ear, you have to make several adjustments. 3. Pairing - equal performance. Simply turn the Latte Mocha on, have your phone bluetooth detect on. Enter the code and you're connected. 4. Signal Strength - both devices performed almost equally. Although the Latte Mocha did have a bit of a better signal, it wasn't much of a difference since distance wise, or with an obstruction such as a sliding glass door between the phone and headset would still produce static from just 5-7 feet away. 5. Sound Quality - Now here's where my biggest problem lies. My old bluetooth headset kills the Latte Mocha in this category. Voice on the Latte Mocha sounds high-pitched and muffled. Although there is clarity in the signal, and the volume is adequate, sound quality is poor compared to my old bluetooth. It's like listening in to an old transistor radio with really bad speakers. Although the signal is clear, you can't quite make out what the other person is saying because the sound is too flat. Another issue I have with the Latte Mocha is that when you answer a call, you have to wait 1-2 seconds before speaking or until you hear a short beep. It's like there is a connection delay which reminds me of 2-way radio. This only happens during initial connection but the rest of the conversation goes smoothly for the most part. I never had that problem with my old headset. One thing the Latte Mocha had going for itself (which is why I decided to keep it) in this category was the background noise filter. In an outdoor setting with slight wind, it would be impossible for me to use my old headset. The Latte Mocha makes outdoor calling slightly more tolerable though I wouldn't say the quality is great either. 6. Battery Life - The Latte Mocha battery life is fairly decent though not spectacular. I use my bluetooth headset constantly throughout the day. I still keep my old Jabra around as backup since the Latte Mocha, on a full charge, will only last me about a day and a half before the battery runs out on me (average of 2 hrs talk time throughout the day while on standby the rest of the time). When doing a comparison, I found the Jabra battery life to be slightly better since I could get at least 2 days out of it without worrying that the device will go dead. In conclusion, I would say that the performance of the Latte Mocha was ""Just OK."" Considering that I only paid 35 bucks for it, a fair deal it is despite the disappointing performance. I have tried several bluetooth headsets in the past but have yet to find a mid-cost model with the perfect balance of look, feel and sound quality. I think the best bluetooth headset I have used to date is the Plantronics Voyager 510. But since I don't want to look like a lost extra from the set of Star Trek, the Latte Mocha will have to do for now.",battery,neutral,neutral

"I was looking for a cover that would protect this thin phone while maintaining a comfortable fit in my pocket. This cover fits relatively close to the phone, it could be a little tighter, but gives me the impression and feeling that the phone is well protected. For the most part the cover contours nicely to the phone. In looking closer, I can see this would not be an easy task. However, even installed correctly, the hole for the recharger does not line up. The hole on the cover, with out manipulation, clears 3/4 of the recharger port and does not line up exactly. When I push the cover up on the phone it does clear the port opening and appears to have enough clearance for recharging. My guess is the cut out hole is off, however, with further use the cover material may stretch to fit better. Once the case is pushed up and the port opening cleared the recharger cord piece clips into the phone and recharges (and so far it has not disengaged during charging). This is a nice looking cover. There is a hand icon instead of letters. I think I would have preferred the letters. But the hand icon does not necessarily look bad. The clear plastic on the inside of the cover suctions nicely to the display window and keypad. The plastic that I have had on past phones laid loosly on the keys and window, which I did not like. There is the round knob left on the case when the phone is detached from its belt clip that prevents the phone from fitting better in my pocket. This is the knob that I have had on other belt clip phone covers. Once the phone is detached from the clip this sown on knob is permanent and is not removable from the cover. Because I prefer to put the phone in my pocket this was disappointing. If you are a person that likes to wear this phone on your belt, this case is a great case for you. If you are someone who likes to put the phone in your pocket and you looking for a sleek phone case you may be dissappointed. Even though I was somewhat disappointed, I have decided to keep the case for the protection it provides and use the cover with the belt clip on the way to and from work. One nice feature of the belt clip and knob is once attached together the phone and case can be rotated incrementally and maintained at a horizontally position (great for sitting or driving). On weekends I will probably remove the case, which is easy, and needs periodic cleaning anyway and store the phone in my pocket with out the case. Although this doesn't fit as nice as I wanted in my pocket, it does provide the protection I wanted and is a very cool looking, well made, belt clip phone case.",screen,neutral,neutral
"Its an ok phone that would be my starting title! why is this, its because the phone its relatively a good phone but you cant compare it to an iPhone after using an iPhone you are just expecting the same features as the iPhone. This is because this phone doesnt let me use an app to check my mac.com email directly from the phone like my iPhone neither its going to be easy setting it up your yahoo or any other non-microsoft application. Youtube works and you can see it ok but not as good as the os from mac that is installed in the iPhone, btw i bought this phone because i was sick and tired of doing workarounds to my hacked iphone so i could use it here in the Republic of Panama. This is a great phone when we talk about the wifi which it gives you a good signal but this phone is not so user friendly and is kinda hard for a person to set it up to make it look like its part of you. This phone has great games though, the screen is great and the 2 megapixels are great! it has great features as video, video calls, night mode, etc! Overall ill give this phone a three stars just because i came from a Ferrari to a Toyota and i think ill stick with my hacked iphone meanwhile nokia comes with a better phone that actual competes against apple's iPhone.

"I love the idea of a smart-flip-phone. I even like that it doesn't have a tiny little qwerty keypad to fumble with. The size of this phone is perfect. Call & sound quality are above average. The speaker phone is loud and sounds good. The 3125 feels solid and fits the hand just right. Maybe it's just me but I have a hard time finding the right buttons on the keypad without looking. It would be nice to be able to feel where you are. The screen looks great although customizing the desktop is limited. Unlike other versions of windows mobile, you can't create or download themes. This phone is very useful as a productivity tool. You can sync it with outlook via cable and it also offers, for free, Xpress mail service which will allow you to check your e-mail and calender when you are away from your pc. In addition to business, I have gotten in the habit of entering all of those details that my wife tells me and setting reminders on the phone. This information also syncs back to your pc so that no matter where I am, I'll get a reminder about those little details and therefore I don't get yelled at anymore. This phone works as an mp3 and video player. Many video formats don't work. I'm not sure if it's because of codecs but It doesn't allow you to install codecs. The sound quality is great with the included earpieces but it doesn't have a standard earphone jack so you can't use any other earphones. The video quality is poor and becomes distorted when you change to fullscreen. I wouldn't expect anything more out of a flip phone. The built in video camera is useless because the videos come out blurry unless you have a very still subject and it's well lighted. It takes decent stills for a phone. Programs are occasionally slow, particularly if you are running more than one program. I am disappointed with the internet speed. Since this phone was recently released, I don't understand why they didn't make it 3g capable. One big complaint that I have is with the micro sd card. It is often unrecognized. I have to turn the phone off, open the back cover, re-seat the SD and sim cards and then power it back on. I suspect that the connection to the card is lost just from the constant movement that happens when you carry the phone. This happens every 2-3 days. My phone is only 3 months old and I wonder if the problem is only going to worsen with age. I recommend this phone for someone who wants to sync with outlook, while being able to listen to tunes and play games on the go and who wants a unique phone to show off. If you want a great phone but don't need windows mobile, consider the LG CU500.",price,neutral,positive
"After all the great reviews i guess i at least expected it to work, even if poorly. i receive calls just fine, but when i make calls, no one can hear me most of the time. It also fits me very bad. How did this thing get made in the first place with the fit this poor? Guess my ear is odd size or something, but this doesnt even come close to fitting well, feels like it will fall off any time and it loses postion(angles away from face) over time. ear hook is flimsy yet thick. i have a no name cheapo unit that cost $10 and blows this away. When this one does work, it is ok at best, bad echo alot of the time. And i HATE the blue flashing indicator light that cant be turned off. Im very disappointed in this unit.

"OK, maybe I liked my Motorola KRZR a little too much. I really LOVED that phone. And then I lost it. Yep, could have killed myself. But, I had to get a new phone and I got this one. The first thing it did was pinch me when I opened it. You have to be careful of that. The volume buttons on the side of the phone are in a bad place. I keep screwing up the volume when I talk. The same buttons adjust the ring volume, so I have set my phone to vibrate on more than one occasion, missing calls. The screen is also smaller, and I found the KRZR a little easier to navigate. I also liked the size of the KRZR. This phone seems clunky. This phone does get the job done, but I expected more from it since it was made by Motorola. Somehow, it just feels cheap. I am looking for another KRZR, but Verizon doesn't seem to have those anymore.",audio,negative,neutral
"I have had this phone for one day. AT first I wanted to throw it in the trash. Here are my complaints: 1. The ear peace socket and the wall/car charger socket utilize the same port. For those of us who use an ear piece that is not bluetooth, you can not charge and talk at the same time. A big disappointment for me. 2. In order for me to save more than one number under a contact name, I have to switch the numbers from my sim card to the phonebook. Also another disappointment when I never had to do this before. I had the samsung e315 previously and this was never an issue. I never had any phone numbers stored in the phone book, only in the sim card. 3. Once you switch the numbers to the phone book to save into groups, all the phone numbers will not store in the group; only the first number that is stored under the contact. The good things: 1. The phone is very cute and very lightweight. 2. The sound is great. 3. The picture/screen resolution is crystal clear and very bright. 4. Once you figure out how to use it, the phone is great. 5. The most important thing....IT IS NOT A MOTOROLA.",battery,neutral,neutral

"I'm a computer professional, and use a lot of other wireless technology for a variety of things - so I finally decided to get a BT headset for use with Skype (which I'm using more often these days). I've tried using this kit with Win XP/SP2 and Mac OS X 10.4.4 - and have toyed a little with it in Linux. I got suckered in by this kit in a store (headset + dongle), and figured I'd give it a shot, after checking out many favorable reviews of the H500 online. Unfortunately, the reviews I read were all about how it works with BT cellphones - I should have dug deeper. The headset itself works fairly well - sound quality on my end is decent, volume is usually fine (depends on both sides of the call, of course), and battery life so far has been great. However, every single person I've talked to has complained of a background ""buzz"" that sometimes makes it difficult to hear me. Also, they note that every once in a while the sound ""hiccups"", and they hear a repeat of something I just said (ie they hear the same bit twice in a row...and then it skips forward a few secs to catch up with me). I've tested it out a bit with the Skype test account system (""Echo123""), and heard the problems myself... Since I've been using Skype for a couple of years now (with wired headsets) with no trouble, I'm fairly confident that it's not related to Skype itself or my computers... I originally suspected the cheap USB dongle (Moto PC850), but my Mac laptop has a built-in BT card, and it has the same problem - so the trouble must be either with the headset itself, or how it all works together with Skype. So it's back to reading reviews for me, to find another solution. I definitely recommend against this ""2-in-1"" kit - save yourself the time/hassle and grief and get separate (better quality) pieces.",shipping,neutral,neutral

"I've owned a number of bluetooth headsets (Jawbone, BlueAnt x3micro) , including the H710's predecessor, the H700. For me, comfort is the most important feature. Both of the Motorola headsets are among the most comfortable headsets that I have owned or tried. They could be worn for hours without a hitch. Voice quality is a close second to comfort, and the H710 doesn't disappoint. I believe voice quality goes hand-in-hand with fit; because the other headsets that I mentioned were ""in-the-ear"" types, if you cannot get them to fit exactly, their sound quickly deteriorates. This is not the case with the H710, which sits ""over-the-ear"". The earloop is barely noticable. I knocked off a star for two reasons: (1) neither myself nor the party I was speaking with while using the headset could tell their was any realistic noise cancellation occurring, even though it was supposedly ""improved"" from that of the H700; and (2) Motorola changed the charger connector! The H700 has a mini-USB connector. I had a bunch of those mini-USB chargers laying around . . in my car, my office, at home. Well, time to toss them because the H710 uses an all together different micro-USB connector.",accessories,positive,positive

The phone is a little smaller than it appeared online, but the backplate I bought (search for T809 back case) gives it a little more weight. You'll still need screen protectors, though, and there's no ""front plate"" to protect it, but I don't like the pouches, so what can I do? A backplate with a single bar across the top could protect it; not sure why there isn't one made yet. In summation, I really like the T809 and if it had Voice-Activated Dialing or better sound, I'd have given it 5 stars. It's a far better phone than any I've owned previously, though, so I'd definitely recommend it.",screen,positive,positive
"For a mid range priced device it's not horrible. It has a very comfortable design with a car visor clip to cradle and charge your device anywhere. The connection process with your phone is a little complicated and will occasionally need a reset for some unexplained reason. But the sound has the potential to sound very good. My biggest problem with this device is that if the phone is not in direct site of the ear piece, the quality of sound dramatically drops off. Even if the phone is in the pocket of your pants on the other side of your body from the device the quality drops off simply because your body is in the middle. The range estimate is solely based off of direct line of site where no bodies, walls, doors, cars or anything else are between the device and the phone.",performance,neutral,neutral
The Good : 1. Amazon made it easy - did have to go to the Sprint store to activate it - but it's been 8 months and I'm happy! 2. Sprint service in LA is decent. Certainly no worse than my Verizon I had for 4 years. When I travel the same is true... 3. The phone works great with a headset - The numbers are not too small... 4. Internet works quite well - can check email in about 30 seconds... very acceptable to me... 5. Camera is fun - but not great... It's just cool to email photos to friends right on the spot... 6. Sync's better than any Palm I've ever had (with Mac) The Minorly Bad... 1. Without a headset - not so good - your cheek can actually hang up the touch screen. 2. Had several pixels go out 6 months in - Sprint replaced the phone no problemo. 3. The car charger is hard to get in and out with my headset... Minor... 4. Sprint customer service is in India...

"The technology on this product is fine; the speaker is good, the microphone picks up sound well, it pairs easily enough, etc. It's even super-small without sacrificing anything. However, the design and user interface of the WEP500 make it near unusable. Specifically, it's the multi-function button that kills it. The multi-function button covers nearly half the surface of the device and is really easy to press. All well and good, except that by default pressing the multi-function once redials the last number. What this leads to is a flood of ""pocket dialing"" if you happen to put this in your pocket, or even just when you're trying to put the thing in your ear. I've taken to dialing my voicemail constantly just so that if my WEP500 accidentally dials a number it won't be anybody I know. That's an insane hoop to have to jump through just because of a bluetooth headset. If you're going to leave this headset in your car or on your desk, and be extra careful every time you insert the earpiece, the device is fine. If you expect to ever transport this with you anywhere, or are less than careful handling it, then this is a headache.

"The IMP52D iTorch external battery is a solidly constructed unit that has held up to several drops it has incurred. The weight feels good in the hand and screams quality. Pros: Extra battery that will recharge my my phone up to two and a half times from one charge on the battery. It accepts the standard USB and micro USB based on charging needs which is always a plus being these cables have become the de facto standard for charging cell phones. Also, the LED light and the laser that are built are nice little bonuses I wasn't aware of when ordering, they've come in handy several times now. Again, solidly built, doesn't add hardly any weight to my gear bag, it holds a charge, and works well for my needs. Cons: Once fully depleted, it takes 4+ hours to recharge. Overall, I am very satisfied with the IMP52D iTorch external battery. It works well, has nice little bonuses with the inclusion of the LED and the laser pointer as well as the bag with included cables. Very reasonable price for what is provided, I would go so far as to state that the it is under priced for all of the features it offers.",build_quality,positive,positive

"I bought this to use in my RV but tried it first in my car. Since I was more concerned with its ability to increase the data signal I placed my Verizon hotspot in the cradle and went to some local weak signal areas. I found that the booster only increased the strength of the signal by a small amount and, when I tried it in my RV, there was almost no increase at all. I had followed the instructions and placed a ferrous metal ground plane on the (fiberglass) roof of my RV and placed the magnetic antenna in the middle of that. I then found, at most, about a 6-10 dB increase using this system, but that was about the same as just connecting one of my existing magnetic antennas on the ground plane and connecting it, without the booster, to the hotspot so I saw no significant increase from using the booster. I have since returned it and purchased the 4G-M version instead. I did not expect to receive the specified 23 dB increase but I did expect to see more than I got from an unamplified antenna.",screen,neutral,neutral

"I got this bluetooth headset to replace my moto 700 when it gave up the ghost. I was hoping that the new model would be better but it has a lot of negatives and wish I would have gone with the old 700. Sound quality is only a bit better. The unit itself is larger and heavier than the 700. The fit on the ear isn't as good. Since the unit is bigger it is hard to slip in my cell case with the phone and it hangs on the outside which makes me worry about losing it. The main drawback is the lack of USB charger now instead of using a universal plug I am back to being a slave to a proprietary plug and I hate it. Hubby and I could take one power cord on vacation and share it now it is another thing to remember to lug around. Also the plug has to be plugged in just right or the unit won't be getting any juice. The 700 would change color as it was charging to let you know when it was getting done this units light comes on or off. I don't remember which it is. If I had to do over again, and I know I will when this one dies, I will go with the 700 again. It was more than good enough.",battery,negative,neutral
"This unit would not charge my Nokia n900 using its USB outputs, until I modified it. But then, neither would at least three other dumb USB chargers I had on hand. Finally, I searched the net for n900 charging issues, and found that the n900 expects the charger to behave as the USB specification for dumb chargers reads, and many don't. Specifically, it expects to see 200 ohms resistance between the D+ and D- pins (the two center pins) and this unit appears to have an open circuit there. It seems that many phones, specifically some iPhone and Blackberry units, do not conform to the USB spec either, and expect to see around 2 volts on D+ - which this unit provides. So, if your phone will charge when connected to a computer, but not when connected to a dumb charger, this is why. Using a magnifier to see the pins adequately, I connected D+ and D- together with a little solder bridge on the printed circuit board. Although this isn't a 200 ohm resistor, it's sufficient to inform the n900 that it's connected to a dumb charger, and it starts to charge. The power is nicely filtered and regulated, no noise on the audio output while charging, so this plays fine in the car while charging while some other dumb chargers contributed so much buzzing from their switching regulators that it wasn't possible to listen to music. I guess manufacturers of dumb chargers are between a rock and a hard place, as not every phone expects the same thing. The ultimate unit would offer a switch on each USB port to fix this. Those who don't want to open their charger can also make a USB cable with a short or 200 ohm resistor between D+ and D- to solve this problem.",battery,neutral,neutral
"The ear piece is comfortable and the battery life a respectable 5-6 hours, but two issues have made it a second choice that came with the wired ear phone that came with my treo 700. First problem is the bluetooth connectivity is spotty. Many times when a call comes in, pressing the ear piece button does not pick it up, and then annoyingly 2-3 minutes into the conversation, the set kicks in and takes the signal from the handset. The second problem is the hinge that keeps the microphone boom in place. It's loose, and won't stay where I put it. The sound hasn't been affected noticably, but I don't like a limp boom.",connectivity,neutral,neutral

If your a Verizon cell phone user it may be a good idea to avoid this product and Verizon in general. Talking to my friends about this in more detail I have come to discover that Verizon does not believe in open formats and puts the clamp down on its customers options. AKA you have to use Verizon products with its phones and no third party vendors. I will not be renewing with Verizon because I believe the customer knows best and I should be allowed to use MY phone with competing products.

"I bought this to work with my iPhone. I usually only buy noise canceling headsets, as I use these mostly when driving with the air conditioning running full blast. So, lets start with the good. This is one of the smallest headsets I've ever seen. It comes with plenty of accessories, such as a desktop dock, and a travel dock. It fits comfortably out of the box with no need for adjustment. The clarity when running at it's peak is one of the clearest I've heard. The downside. The build quality of this is awful. It feels like anything can break it in half, doing anything with it. Because of this, if I want to put it in my pocket, I need to put it in the travel dock, negating the purpose of it's size. If I want to put it somewhere in my car, once again, I have to put it in the travel dock. This wouldn't be such a problem, but the top to the travel dock is so tight, that when you pull the top off, the headset loses contact with the magnetic connector, causing it to fly out of the case. This isn't a one time thing. This happens every single time. The noise canceling on this device is also the worst I've ever used. I've had several people hang up on me because of their inability to understand me when driving. This is completely unacceptable for a headset that claims to have ClearTalk or whatever it is they are calling it. After less then 15 minutes of having it plugged in, and having it on the clarity of calls goes down hill. I was on the phone with AT&T making adjustments to my data plan, and had to hold my iPhone up to my head just for what she was saying to be clear at all. Beyond that, I've had the headset for a total of 9 days, and the headset is now almost instantly starts playing the low battery sound, and goes dead within 5 minutes of being unplugged. Thats not on the phone, thats simply being unplugged. Before writing this review, I did some research on this headset, out of fear that I would be too harsh on this device. The static has been well documented in other reviews, as well as the noise canceling not being as good as expected. As far as the battery life goes, this could easily be a fluke with this one single unit. With all of this said, this is marketed as a higher end bluetooth headset. While this maybe acceptable as a lower tier model, the constant static, and the seemingly non-existent noise canceling I can't say I'd recommend this. If you buy this, expect a beautiful, yet fragile headset, with entry level performance. I have all ready submitted my request for a refund on this.",audio,negative,negative
"I bought this hoping many of the stellar reviews would trump the many poor reviews, but unfortunately it turned out to not be the case for me. I ordered the item to be able to charge my new AT&T Inspire 4G, by HTC. It's a battery hog, so having a portable recharge would be great. I opened the box, and was really excited because the product is sexi to look at... it's not one of the dark black boxy electronics you usually associate with this type of product. It's curvy and nice looking. Initial read of the instructions proved to be a challenge, as it's clearly a manual that was written in Chinese and then translated and converted to english for North American sale. It was a bit contradictory and vague in a couple aspects, so I went online and watched the how-to, just so I could say with certainty I was using it properly. I charged it initially for 24 hours (it recommends 4-6 hours), and the instruction manual that came with it said one light will flash when it was completed charging. After 24 hours, TWO lights were still charging. I went onto their website and it states that when charging is complete, the light should remain on and solid. However this was not the case for me. I decided based on the specs, 24 hours should have been more than enough to charge it (by technological spec 5 hours from complete drain to full charge is all it should take). I plugged in my device, and immediately all 4 lights lit up on the battery pack indicating full capacity. After 5 minutes, it dropped to 3, then after 10 minutes it went to 2... At this point I contacted the manufacturer. They were quick to respond that it's likely defective. I questioned if they see this a lot and they said yes. I asked why they don't resolve it and they said (in broken english) that it was what people expect for half the price of the competition. Seems a bit odd of a response from them. To me I'd want to put out the best (usable) product for the price, or not put out a product, but hey, whatever. BOTTOM LINE: Amazon is issuing me a refund as I'm sending this one back. Normally I'd give the benefit of the doubt and re-order another one, but given the less than impressive response from the manufacturer, I'm planning on returning for a refund. I'm going to order the Zagg Sparq 2.0, which gets great reviews. At almost 2x the price, I'll have to suck it up and pay for it, but I suppose if I want a product that comes with warranty and support, that's the cost of it. I also learned that Amazon doesn't have a lot of flexibility in their marketplace seller practices, so they said their hands are tied. I'll stick to ordering direct from Amazon going forward. :-(",accessories,negative,negative

PROS: * extremely light * good volume, even when driving (windows up, noisy car) * easy to use * good reference guide * easily usable for right or left ear (I use the left ear) * I'm guessing, but should work well with any Bluetooth capable phone * affordable * can be a good distance from the phone and still converse (15-20 feet before the static kicks in) * long standby battery life (I sometimes go 3-4 days without charging, that includes mild talking as well) CONS: * once in a while there's a little static even when close to the phone, but it's white noise for me at this point * at first, I found it odd to get it on my ear, as it sits _ON_ the ear, not _IN_ the ear ... after a couple different approaches, easy breezy Overall, two thumbs up ... I like it so much, I've talked a couple people into getting it and they love it! If you want a great wireless headset for your cell, buy this one ...

"Fits very nicely, albeit not as snug as I had originally thought it would be. Regardless, it keeps the phone well protected and offers extra grip so it doesn't slide out of my hand as easily, a BIG plus for me. Others have mentioned that the charger's cutout is not quite aligned with the phone, and this is true. HOWEVER I'd like to mention that it doesn't take much effort to simply pull it into alignment to plug the charger in. I've never had the charger slip out due to the case overnight, so I don't see this as any sort of problem. The knob on the back for the belt clip is a bit of a nuisance for those that like to carry the phone around in pockets (like me). But still, not that big of a deal. Just makes it feel a bit bulky in a pocket, but at least I know it's there!

"Around Christmas 2004 I bought the Motorolla V276 phone from verizon. Horrible idea. Really Horrible idea. I bought it because of the ideal price, but I really got what I paid for. The battery of the phone dies 3-4 times quicker than every other phone I have ever owned, there is a constant static in the background no matter if in the basement of my apartment or driving to work in the suburbs. It has gotten to the point where I can only talk on the phone when it is plugged into the charger and I am holding the phone at a certain angle. Usually when this happens I take it to the verizion store and they replace it with a new phone. So the customer service on this phone is great, and thats the only thing that saves it from a 1-star rating, but I shouldnt have to go to Verizion every 3 months to get a new phone. Maybe next time this happens I will just buy a Nokia. One last reason I dislike this phone (although not a technical problem): When going through your recent calls, it lists your last 60 phone calls. There is no need for that, and it could be seen as a privacy issue.",accessories,negative,negative
"Battery arrived quickly and worked great - for about a week. I tried giving it the benefit of the doubt and see if it would bounce back. No luck. Contacted seller and told they would reply by email by the end of the very next day. NINE days later they call me on my cell (the one with the new, poor battery). They say my expectations were too high - was I unreasonable to expect a brand new battery in a basic flip phone to last more than 1.5 days without ever making one phone call? I don't text or use any data on this phone; the battery should last longer. And if I make one 15 minute call on a full charge, it'll be dead by the time I wake up the next morning if I don't charge it. While on the phone with someone from the customer service department of Everything Overstock, my phone went from 1/2 charged to no charge and the beep of death. They convinced me to take down my poor feedback, but something needs to be said. They DID promise to give me a partial refund. And they seemed nice enough.

"I had this phone for about 4 days. I got it because I thought it would give me better reception and volume than my old phone (Samsung E-315). I also thought the FM radio would be cool. It did not really improve my reception, and the volume was a little better, but the earhole is small and in a wierd place, so it's hard to hear if there's any wind or noise in the background. The FM radio was cool, but it only comes with one earphone, so that's pretty worthless. You also need to hook up the headset to hear the radio on loudspeaker. Speaking of which, the speakerphone is not very loud either. Other Cons were that the bluetooth didn't seem strong. I heard a lot of crackling when I was more than about 5 ft away from the phone on a bluetooth headset (nokia hdw-3).( I know it's the phone because I got a Motorola Razr and it works much better, and hardly has any static at long distances (20+ feet)). Another thing that really irritated me was that if you don't close everything out before you physically close the phone it opens back up to the same spot. This didn't seem to bad at first, but it seemed to screw things up when someone called while something else was opened. I also had problems answering calls if I was going through menus or on the mobile web and it got really annoying. There were some good things: The ring was plenty loud, the screen was clearly viewable even in direct sunlight, the internet (tmobile web) was very fast- maybe twice as fast as on the razor and my previous phone (boring looking screens though). The phone looks good and has a cool feel. Nice buttons and easy to press. Very customizable for menus and net pages. You can edit and zoom your photos after you take them. Nice to do list, notes, and stopwatch features. Reception was average as far as I could tell. Anyways, I was not satisfied with this phone. I paid $50 with a 2 year tmobile agreement. I brought it back for the Razr for $70 with the same agreement, and I am so happy with the Razr!! The Razr is much smaller, has great voice quality and volume, better bluetooth, better (great) speakerphone, The screen is huge and amazingly brilliant (not so great in direct sunlight, but that's not a major problem for me).

When I purchased two of them, they took a very long time to end up at my front door, and that is a problem for huge music lovers like myself. When I finally got them I was excited, and I plugged it into my phone right away. There was a huge surprise, the sound in my headphones sound distorted, and when I unplugged it and plugged it back in, it still sounded distorted. Eventually the adapter did work, when it wanted to. I did a little troubleshooting, and it was the adapter that caused the audio distortion. Why this occurred I really don't know why. One day I accidentally, dropped one of the adapters into my soda, and after that, it works when it wants to, now I use the other one, and that works a lot better then the other adapter I dropped in my soda, but it still has its days where you can hear distortion.

"The iTorch IMP52D happened to be the second external battery I purchased in order to boost the life of my numerous portable devices. It turned out to be a great choice for the following reasons: * Quality craftsmanship I feel that my expectations regarding mobile accessories, particularly when it comes to external batteries, are realistic, especially considering the manufacturing costs required to achieve any level of consistency, dependability, longevity, safety, etc. in a device like the iTorch. Let's face it, batteries of any kind have always been expensive. Despite this, what New Trent does well with the IMP52D is enclose it in a case that should wear quite nicely. The sturdiness of it feels ample to the squeeze and short of any catastrophic drops should remain intact until well after the battery quits doing its job. Grade: A * Tech to spec As other reviewers have kindly taken the time to share the charge/depletion times of the iTorch I will not bother the specifics. Suffice it to say that the actual performance of the battery in comparison to New Trent's specs for the device are closely related and thus, quite satisfactory. Grade: A * Design Compared to my other external battery the New Trent is sleek and sexy. Mind you, both are made of plastic. Yet, where my first battery looks so shiny as to be cheap the iTorch nicely combines a thin, chrome border that serves as an accent piece where the lid and the body of the enclosure meet with an otherwise smooth, matte black surface. While it's certainly not elegant it does more comfortably fit my style. As such, I'm more likely to use it when out and about without considering whether or not someone is wondering if I've just scored big on the Magic Table crane machine. Moreover, when looking to use my external battery I'm often rummaging blindly through a bag of peripherals and accessories to do so. In fact, I often plug my portable device into my external battery sight unseen in that I'm trying my best to stay visually focused on the other task at hand. New Trent helps indulge my OCD by designing the business end of the iTorch so as to be shaped just differently enough that I know which end is which without having to look at it. Admittedly, it's minor but still a nice touch. Grade: A * Bells & whistles (read lights) Simply put, the flashlight feature is adequate. It will do in a pinch which is probably the exact protocol by which it was designed. Even so, it does seem a bit faint (I clearly didn't perform any measurement of lumens or such). However, the laser pointer deserves a few words. My litmus test of laser pointers is whether or not the beam will show up on the panel of my HDTV from where I normally sit, which is roughly at a distance of 7 feet. Few laser pointers I've owned have ever been visible. This was not the case with the iTorch pointer. In fact, the laser pointer performed well across the various backgrounds against which I used it and more than redeemed the slightly lackluster flashlight. Grade: A * Note to New Trent In an effort to improve upon the user experience I'm compelled to mention the following in parting. As I prepared to write my review of the IMP52D I thought to refer to the user manual as a starting point. When I couldn't find it among my piles of file folders I tracked it down in the New Trent support forum. However, the information it provided regarding the function of the three modes was absolutely inaccurate. While I was able to parse the directions I didn't do so without a sense of inconvenience. Where the manual included with the original packaging clearly details the operation of the battery, flashlight and laser pointer (yes, I did actually take the time to find it in order to ensure it too didn't possess the same inaccuracy) the guide online DOES NOT in that if you follow the directions to activate the laser pointer by pressing and holding the power button for 1 second you will never do so as the battery must be turned on in order for the pointer to engage. Otherwise, with the battery turned off, pressing and holding the power button for 1 second merely turns the battery on but leaves the pointer inert. Grade: Fail Despite the minor oversight with the online user guide, New Trent has done a very respectable job of designing an external battery that goes well with both my portable devices and my sense of style. Well done!",accessories,positive,positive

"My last phone was the Kyocera Phantom; a phone that had very little function besides making and receiving calls. About two weeks ago I upgraded to the LG 8500. At first I was extremely happy with it, but a few days ago I ran into some problems. I'll get to that later. 1.) Camera: For a cellphone camera, I'm impressed. You can change the capture resolution for photos, 160x120 up to 1280x960. The photos come out a little fuzzy, as can be expected with a cellphone camera. My only issue with the camera is that there's no flash. As for video, one excellent aspect is that you can change the option to record as much video as you have the space for. Considering you can expand your memory to 2gb with an SD micro memory card, this means you can record rather lengthy videos. Unfortunately, the resolution is very low. 2.) Sound Recording; Ringtones: The Chocolate can record sounds, but only up to one minute. I was a bit disappointed with this; they should have used the same feature the video camera offers, allowing you to record as much sound as you have memory for. As for ringtones.. I'm a bit frustrated. If you save a sound, you can only play it in My Sounds or txt message it to someone; you can't set it as a ringtone. HOWEVER: I have learned to make my own ringtones and get around that. What you have to do is make a sound clip, about 40 seconds long, in low bitrate mp3 (I've been using 64 bitrate MONO mp3's. Use a program like GoldWave to edit your mp3's down to this size.) I then e-mail the sound to my phone. When I open the email as a text message, I have the option to save the sound as a ringtone. Note that if you make the sound too long, or the file too large, you will not be able to save it as a ringtone. 3.) Mp3 Player Function: I was a bit disappointed with the mp3 player function. The sound is decent enough through the built in speaker, but obviously sounds much better through extrenal speakers or a headset. A few days after I got the phone I purchased the Music Essentials kit and a 1gb SD memory card. After installing the Music Essentials software, I realized that it's pretty much useless if you have a memory card. The interface isn't user friendly, and it converts all of your music to low quality WMA files. The best way to use music on this phone is to transfer your mp3's directly to the SD memory card. Some computers have a memory card port built in (I know mine does,) but you can also get an external USB card reader. This should work on a Mac as well, but make sure your music is in mp3 and not the Apple format, m4a. The mp3 playing program on the phone is just aweful. It isn't user friendly in any way. You have to put all of your mp3's onto a playlist if you want to listen to them on shuffle; scrolling through your songs is laggy and at times difficult; and to be honest, the themes for the mp3 player are just ugly. Hopefully software upgrades will come out within a few months to fix some of these problems. 4.) The touchpad, the keypad: I've heard alot of complaints about the touchpad. I have it on the highest sensitivity and I find that it works great. It did take some getting used to, but now I love it. As for the keypad.. the buttons are just too close together, and too small. Txt messaging has been an experience... I'm constantly hitting the wrong button by accident, sometimes two or three at a time.. and I don't even have large hands. 5.) Display: I love the screen on this phone. It's a great size for viewing photos, videos, and games. The screen is beautiful, though it does have a tendancy to show fingerprints a bit too much, considering the glossy finish. 6.) THE BATTERY: Alright. Here's that problem I mentioned earlier. A few days ago, my phone's battery started dying incredibly fast---in as little as 15 minutes after a full charge. I got incredibly frustrated, and last night I went to a Verizon Wireless store. Tech Support told me that the phone's battery can be drained that quickly because the phone is constantly looking for better signal. In a dead zone, like a basement, a concrete building, whatever---the phone will die within 20 minutes. They told me there was nothing I could do but turn my phone off when I'm in a deadzone. I left, obviously frustrated, because that is a TERRIBLE feature. I went home, and I was researching my phone on internet forums. I was reading a topic about the Version 4 software upgrade (which puts SPEAKERPHONE on the Chocolate!) and someone seemed to be having the same problem I was with the battery. It seems that the problem is Verizon's EVDO network. Here are the instructions on how to disable EVDO and use the standard network. With this option enabled, the battery won't drain anywhere near as quickly. (Since I switched, my phone's been on for over 24 hours and is only missing one bar of batter) To disable EVDO: Go into menu hit 0 the pass is 000000 push 3 for network select push 1 for mode preference then go down to 1x only This will greatly increase your battery life if you don't have evdo in your area. Now that I've fixed the battery issue, I'm back to loving this phone. If the mp3 function was as user friendly as, say, an iPod, this would be the only device I need for music, pictures, and.. of course.. phone calls.",audio,positive,positive

"Just got these this past weekend. The headphones are made well, and pretty comfortable. They paired up with my blackberry 8320 curve in a matter of seconds after the initial 2 hour charge of the headphones. The sound quality on music and calls is acceptable but not exceptional. The bluetooth does not transmit signal with 0 distortion. there is an underlying distortion (barely noticeable) when playing music even at a low volume. People understand me on phone calls but it is apparent to the other person that i am using some sort of device by the ""boominess"" of the call. I would not have kept these if they were still priced at the $80 - $100 they originally hit the martket at, but for $40, i'll hold on to them. If you are very picky about sound quality, and are looking for high performance, look elsewhere.",connectivity,neutral,neutral

"Note- this review is on the i855 which runs on Boost Mobile service and differs only cosmetically from the i850. I've been pretty much a happy Boost Mobile subscriber for over a year now. My first phone with them was the i730, which was great but the mouthpiece crapped out on me. So I bought an i450, which was ok, and durable as all hell (I think it shares a lot of components with Nextel's i560) but I saw way too many 12 year olds toting the thing around. So today I bought an i855 and for the most part I'm very impressed. The camera takes decent pictures, the screen is large and colorful, and it actually allows limited viewing of images on the internet. Calls come out clearer than any cellphone I've ever owned- it's almost landline quality. Problem is, sometimes service cuts out in places where the i450 and i730 still had reception- like my living room. Literally, right now it went from 4 bars down to zero. If this problem works itself out, consider this a five star review.",camera,neutral,neutral
"I'd come across the earlier Golla smartphone pouch, and though I bought it for its style and quality I felt the design had some flaws. Primarily, a grommet in the upper left risked scratching/marring the corner of my iPhone with constant metal on metal contact. The velcro was too strong and very loud when pulling the flap up, and the item was annoyingly overbranded, with ""Golla"" in bright white everywhere, on every side. Still, I liked it enough to remove the velcro patches, covered the grommet on the inside with black gaffer's tape, and blacked out the logo with a marker. I know that's incredibly fussy, but I had it with me all the time and had to look at it quite a lot. My alterations to it made it the ideal pouch I wanted. This new version has no grommet and less branding, more tasteful, and the style, design, and quality remain excellent. I removed the velcro patches again; they're needless. What's great about these pouches is the softness and ease of carrying them around, slipping them in and out of a larger satchel or purse or bag, and of course the protection it provides for your smartphone while on the go. I bought this one because my first one has become worn after a couple of years of constant use, though I still have it. They wear and settle in even more comfortably like a good pair of jeans, with a lot of years of life left in them.",price,positive,positive

"Every now and then a product comes along that meets or exceeds expectations. The Supertooth 3 is one of those products! From the packaging, to the setup, to it's performance, I have been impressed with every aspect of this unit. Cool packaging that did not require a tool box full of utility knives to open up. In 2 minutes I had the unit charging on my desk. After 90min or so, the charging indicator showed a full charge and off I went to the car. Over the course of the next 5min, I powered the unit on, selected my preferred language, paired my iPhone 3G to it and downloaded my 963 contacts. Then I set up voice control and made my first call! I did all this yesterday and have made about a dozen calls while driving so far. Not a single person has commented about call quality and once I bring up the subject, they tell me they can't tell any difference from any other calls. This product is well worth the $85 I spent for it and I would definitely recommend it. If there were a 10 star rating, it would get that!",shipping,positive,negative

"I have gone through both the monster i sonic and now the griffin i-talk. First let's start with the Monster, outgoing call quality may be better that the Griffin but it has a huge and fatal flaw, and that is the dongle itself. The Monster has a huge connector, which at first may not seem like a big deal, but it acts like a lever when put it into your pants pocket. It will definitely remove your headphone jack from the iphone circuit board, it in fact did so in less than a week after purchase. (Thank you Apple Store SF. for letting me upgrade to 16gb as I returned my broken phone) This is just through normal use, I was even pretty cautious as I just bought the phone, if you put the phone in your shirt pocket that may help, but ultimately even that will lead failure. Now lets move on to the Griffin. They took a different route. With this you plug your headphones into the top of the cable which makes for a much lower profile at the phone itself, but as noted adds that length to your current headphone cord. I am lucky to have fairly new headphones that allow for replaceable cords ( Bose OnEar if you are interested.) so the Griffin just replaces that which is pretty sweet. Now the bad news. The cord on the Griffin has a vinyl cover which seems to be the rage these days. I am not sure why however as in my exierience they blow. The problem is that the material is relatively stiff and now the cable is failing at the connector (hey at least its not my phone this time). So long story short avoid the Monster at all costs, and if you can manage to not trip over the Griffin's cord maybe buy 2 at a time as the crappy cord materials make it disposable at best. Can I please get a decent solution? One with full functionality ( I am looking at you Bose). The i-phone is awesome it amazes me that noone can figure out the friggin cord though.",audio,neutral,neutral
"The GOOD: Beautiful phone. Stylish, thin, black, with great reception (using Cingular in St. Louis area) and clarity. The screen is very clear, colorful, and large, great for playing games like chess - I can actually SEE the pieces! :) The BAD: First, after 33 days the black RAZR started making this very high pitched noise if I just opened the phone and put it to my ear. Several Cingular employees also heard it. I returned the phone not once, but twice through the warranty exchange and each phone did the same thing. I tried using a different battery, a different SIM card, but to no avail - all three black V3 RAZR's made that high pitched noise. At this point I became frustrated - it sounds obsessive-compulsive, but I am not paying over $300 for a phone that makes that noise. Second,the camera sucks. I'm not a photographer, and I don't plan on buying a nice camera, nor do I intend to buy a digital camera. I just want the camera on my phone to be ""good,"" not decent or crap. The 4 x digital zoom distorts the final pic so much it's worthless. Even without that you end up with a blurry, pixelated pic not worth your time. There is a great lag between the time you snap the pic and when the phone takes it. Third, while you can watch video, you can't record it. And even if you can tolerate taking pics, you have no memory to do so. With ten pics, I'm already at 20% capacity. Finally, while the overall phone feels sturdy, the side buttons (and I've tested three new phones) feel a bit flimsy on certain phones and not on others, and the top screen (when the phone is closed) is actually askew to the point where I can see the copper wiring underneath on 2 out of 3. The UGLY: If you want a very nice looking phone (just don't drop it - but why would you, it's $300) that has excellent clarity and only plan to make and receive calls, I'd buy it! If, however, you are one of the crowd who demands greater functionality (while probably sacrificing some of the eye-candy appeal of the RAZR) from your toys, I'd suggest a different high-end phone.",screen,neutral,neutral
This is what most people like to say as the most bang for the buck i love this phone and i will keep it until my contract is up. I had a Razr phone and found this one to be alot better as in it last longer and is stronger also its so cheap you don't care if you break it. The camera is good and it has a very strong signal all the time. Great speaker phone for when your in the car or just don't want it by your ear. Highly recommended.,price,positive,positive
"The screen guard that came with this accessory bundle does not fit the AT&T Tilt screen. It is slightly larger. When I tried to make it fit, the stylus on the Tilt does not work. Another user has written the same review about this screen guard issue here in Amazon. I contacted the seller SFPlanet several times with this issue and they have not mailed me a replacement screen guard that will fit my screen so far. I have filed a A-Z claim with amazon to ask for a partial refund. Otherwise, the delivery was prompt and the other accessories seem to be as advertised. If you have to buy a decent screen guard separately for Tilt, it will cost $10 to $15 with shipping. So, I am a little disappointed that this bundle was advertised with a screen guard, but it does not fit.

"I got my phone for $50 with verizon's new every two plan, so the price was great. However, i was unable to get music on the phone right out of the box unless i downloaded songs from the phone. Obviously i don't want to pay for songs i already own and Verizon does present 2 options here. Buy their music essentials kit or buy a micro sc card and reader. This is very disappointing. It seems the music playing capabilities are useless without purchasing some extras. The phone is very nice looking and getting used to the buttons was quite easy. Nice size for the phone as well. Oddly, my vibrate stopped working after 1 day and verizon is providing me with a replacement phone. I've never had a problem with my 2 previous LG phones, so this was a surprise. Lack of a speaker phone is also disappointing. Especially considering the phone has an external speaker and voice recognition. I was really expecting more from verizon's latest marquee product.

This phone is great if you don't put a lot of data on it. I had to buy a memory card so that I could stop getting the message that I was running out of space. But after 10 pictures it still tells me that. This phone is great if you don't plan on using it as a pda, or really using it but for fun. For me, I need a PDA and it just didn't work for me.

"This was my first bluetooth headset purchase for the Sprint Samsung A900 phone. Overall, I found this to be a very well-made product and easy to pair with a bluetooth phone. Pros: Excellent reception indoors and outdoors, I never had any problems with someone trying to hear me or complaining about background noise, no echos, lightweight and compact, fits easily on either ear, 8 hours talk time, good standby time, (I usually charge it every other day), extension piece is close to your mouth for better reception, no battery required, easy to use for call waiting, voice dialing, and other phone features. If the features don't work then it might not be the headset but what your phone is able to do. Cons: This con may be something in my phones features but none the less I experienced it so let me share it with you. When I am on standby and want to place a call, I would touch the button to place a call and nothing would happen. So, I would have to do a fake call, hang up, and then when I would touch the button and it would work fine. Im not sure if that is because it was on standby for too long but that was strange. Also, if you are on the phone and want to connect to the headset there is no easy way. I have to switch it on my phone but again, that may be a phone feature. So, all in all this is a quality item.

I just needed a working phone for a cheap price. I have not been dissapointed thus far. You do have the option of setting the phone to vibrate, then ring, and I have found that this allows me to hear most incoming calls. This phone rides around in the bottom of my backpack all day and is doing fine (which is why I say ""most"" incoming calls). I don't think its the ringer volume per say, but rather the location. Its small and light, gets good reception. I didn't find the menu layout confusing as some people did. It has a calendar function which I found useful. And the battery lasts for 2 to 3 days (I do spend a lot of time on the phone) and charges up again within an hour or 2. The games it comes with aren't that great - they're not supposed to be. They're just there to whet your appetite so you buy the full versions from T-mobile. Also, some people lament the lack of an outside ""call answer"" button - they have to flip it open.

"To be truthful I never wanted to buy a case for my Palm m100 in the first place, but the hinges on the plastic flip cover that came with it broke apart after only 3 months. Because I could not find a replacement part, in order to have my Palm protected I had to buy a case. I am not overjoyed with this product, but it is adequate and does the job that it was designed to do. All of the complaints about this product are true. The Velcro is small and it can be difficult to close the cover on the case, the stylus is difficult to remove unless the cover is flipped all the way open, the stitching is of poor quality and does not look like it will last. Another irritating that I have discovered is that the opening seems to be off a little bit. It covers up the screen a little bit at the top. However, the nice thing about this case are that is made of very nice leather and the Velcro beltloop is very convenient. With this case strapped to my belt, I usually remove the Palm from the case without removing the case from my belt in order to use it. I have taken to using the case more as a belt holster. This way, the problems of the stylus and the mismatched opening are not a problem. This is the manner that I would recommend using this product. Why 3 stars?: I feel the case was poorly designed and will far apart and be unsatisfying in the long run.

"I read several reviews of the products available to adapt my regular Sennheiser earbuds for use with the iPhone and eventually, despite some bad reviews (i.e. it breaks after a month or so), settled on the Griffin SmartTalk. It worked well, and the extra headphone length that the product creates was actually a good thing for using the phone at the gym or under a jacket. However, after about a month of using it, the left headphone connection became static-y and/or cut out unless the phone was just-so in my pocket. Then, about 3 weeks later, both headphones cut out completely. I assume that the connection between the wire in the nylon and the jack broke since, by twisting and pressing, I could sometimes get a very faint connection.

For those who wrote it's difficult to put the headset into the charger...you need to gently push the headset in making sure the ear loop rests in the indentation until you hear a click. It sets in securely. No tapping needed. Now if you remove the handset or headset and put them back in both will start to charge again. Initial appearances (charge battery icon on the handset and red light on the headset) make it look as if neither has fully charged. They have. 3 hours for the headset and just over 15 hours until the handset said it was charged. Handset is light. Some have called it 'cheap' feeling. My only 'cheap' feel is the light tension spring on the belt clip. Then again it's not designed for sweat pants... It's very nice to be able to sync my Outlook contacts. Make sure they are nice and neat killing duplicates or seperate entries for the same person. You have 200 contacts and each contact can have up to 3 numbers. The program allows you to check off which ones you want to sync with the phone which is a nice option. I didn't need the pet sitter on the Calisto for example. I agree the buttons are on the small side and I have small hands. Not as much of importance to me as is extremely clear speaker phone, mobility (no longer teathered to the phone!!) and a comfortable headset all of which syncs with the iPhone 3G seamlessly. Regarding the speakerphone on hand and head set...I hear with perfect clarity on both with volume adjustment being independent. Callers state they can hear me perfectly either source but state the headset sounds as if I were in the same room. My home is a Wi-Fi zoo. There are more waves bouncing off of walls than Carters makes liver pills! That being said the majority of signals on all devices are 'very good' unless you're sitting on a router. My microwave killed calls on a different cordless before. There were no interruptions on any calls. I noted a hum on my end but callers heard nothing and if I weren't in 'test mode' and searching for things wrong with the performance I probably wouldn't have noticed. Note: this is with the volume up high. My personal preference is to set on high & I'll probably pay for in later years, but I like my phone calls up high to not miss a word. Note on the syncing of the headset...turn off the headset, then turn on when the phone is in search mode. Instructions give the impression you should wait for the cell to find the headset but move to the next step and you'll sync ASAP. The unit comes with a very limited quick start guide. This phone can do MUCH more than it first looks like. PRINT THE 61 PAGE GUIDE FROM PLANTRONICS WEBSITE!! Tons of helpful info and Plantronics does have a great support site and help system. Easy screen menu...perhaps a little antiquated in apperance but clear and functional. I like the calls answered//missed/dialed feature. How many times have you made a call and need to re-dial that number 5 calls later but can't? This unit lets you see them all. The phone book search has shortcuts...again print the guide off of the website. Agreed no phone is perfect. Like building your own home even if you think you thought of everyting you'll find something missing eventually. This phone could benefit from either larger or rubberized buttons for folks with larger fingers or long nails, but if you want ONE home/home office unit with complete mobility (no 4' wired cord) which syncs seamlessly with your cell on one bluetooth headset this is it.",price,positive,neutral
"The Jabra BT-3030 is a good stereo bluetooth alternative to bluetooth headphones. They allow you to use your own wired headphones too, so you don't look like a completely silly. The bluetooth phone interface works well too and shuts down the music when you have an incoming call. Music comes back on after you hang up the call. I use it with a Blackberry Curve, LG Dare and an iPod with a iCombi bluetooth adapter. You can also connect to two devices at the same time. I connect to the iPod for music and the Blackberry for calls, at the same time. I recommend them with a good bluetooth signal. The iCombi is a barely decent bluetooth transmitter, so the BT-3030 doesn't always have the best sound.",connectivity,neutral,positive
I purchased this approximately a month and a half ago and it has been perfect. Everyone I talk to on it says I sound good and I can perfectly hear them.

"I recently purchased this bluetooth Scala-500 and used it all about maybe 5 times. Why such a short amount of time? Because the sound quality heard on the other end is so poor that I am told it sounds like I am in a windy tunnel when in fact I am in the car with the windows up and radio off. It's a bit too hot to drive with air condition off and windows up just so the person on the other end can hear me. Now I keep this piece of junk in my console and will only use it if my Logitech bluetooth is out of power. If you buy this make sure you plan to use it in a place like a library where there are no sounds at all to interfere. The only good thing about this headset is that it was easy to setup and connects well with my cell phone. Think twice about buying this product or check it out at your local retailer first. Even with the rebate I only paid $[...], but still not a bargain. The one star was for the ease of setting up with my cell phone.",connectivity,negative,negative
"I bought the Platronics 330 because it was very inexpensive. I find it a little hard to put on.

"I just bought this on Christmas Eve since I really wanted to test out my first iPhone GPS app (the $1 MotionX GPS Drive, which recommended this Griffin mount on its web site). I rushed out to the Apple store at 3PM on Dec 24 and got the last one. Bad idea. First off, the Apple store charges over 100% markup. Yes, I bought it for $30 at the Apple store when you can get it elsewhere for $15 (or Amazon for like $12). Second, I couldn't get my iPhone to fit into the damn thing until I realized, oh shoot, I have to take off the protective case. Seriously folks, we need a mount that will accept iPhones in their cases! Make a separate model JUST for those 75% of us who have a protective case and don't want to take it off each time we go into our cars. Finally, the biggest problem is what those have mentioned here before: the options for positioning the mount are limited given the design of the neck. I gave up after a few minutes of frustration trying to get right angle. I returned this to the Apple store the same day and swapped it for the Kensington model that works in the air vent and also amplifies sound -- a little more expensive, but it mounts pretty well into the car's AC vents rather than relying on the suction cups only. It also works with iPhones that have cases on them. So far I've been pretty happy with it.",audio,neutral,neutral
"I purchased this case for my new Galaxy S3. It was a good choice. The color is just as pictured and the case fits snugly around my phone. It doesn't add much weight at all or any bulk, so the phone still remains slim. There are small indentations in the case for the volume and lock button. It provides protection and prevents the user from accidentally pushing those side buttons. I recommend this product to anyone who wants a quality case for their phone and also loves kitties.",audio,positive,positive
"I received the unit, and charged it as per instructions. All the features it had were excellent. The sound quality was terrible, it seems to have to much base, and the party I was talking to said I kept breaking up; this happened on all my calls and in different areas; so it eliminates location and other phone problems. I called their tech support which instructed me to adjust the boom away from my face and that may fix it. That did not work. I ended up returning the unit..... for me it was unusable. Which was to bad, because it was comfortable to wear and adjust. I research further on bluetooth earphones and found out that some units are more compatible with mobil phones. I guess I just have to find the one that is compatible with mine.",battery,negative,neutral

"I have had this phone for 2 months now. First, the Good Size, Call Quality, User Interface, Volume, Virgin pricing plans, web extras. It is very thin and can be stuck in any pocket without making it look like you just shoplifted half the store. The call quality has been excellent, much like my 2 previous phones from sprint were (Virgin runs off of the Sprint PCS network for those who didn't know). The interface is clean and simple for anyone to use. The volume of the call is loud and clear as is the ringer - I have yet to not hear the phone ringing in my pocket (one of my biggest problems with my last Samsung phone). Virgin has really simple pre-paid pricing plans with a well organized and useful website. Virgin offers lots of ringtones and wallpaper online at 2 bucks a pop as well as celebrity voice mail & rescue ringtones. Now, the bad Button size, battery life, built in extras. The buttons are very small and can be difficult to operate if you have large hands (Once the phone book is programmed this becomes much less of an issue). This phone will not stay charged for more than 1 day - even if no calls are made. I have to make sure I charge it every night or else it becomes useless - this is my biggest complaint about this phone. There are hardly any backgrounds or ringtones that come with the phone. I had to go online and pay more for a ringtone than I would for an entire song from iTunes.",build_quality,neutral,neutral
"The product finally arrived after ordering it twice and waiting. The fact that it is currently one of the very few horizontal holster-style cases for the Samsung Galaxy Note is the pro. It does not cover/protect the entire phone. There are two completely exposed surfaces/edges at the top and bottom of the phone from corner to corner. The corner protection seems very minimal. I do not dare to try a drop test because of the lack of coverage. Basically, this product is a horizontal holster-style carrying case with very little phone protection. I can not wait for Otterbox to catch-up with a case.",accessories,negative,positive

"I purchased my FreeSpeak about a month ago and have been using it daily with my Nokia 6310i GSM phone. Overall, this is a great product. I was a little hesitant when I purchased it, as this device is an ""over the ear"" design, and past experience with these types of devices has not been positive (I am an eyeglass wearer, and many times these devices do not ""sit"" well). I am happy to report that the FreeSpeak fits very well, and easily qualifies as the most comfortable headset I have ever used. Other positives: battery life (3 hours talk and about a week on standby), voice quality (excellent up to about ten feet away from the phone, and people on the other end of the connection report near-corded quality), weight (very light--I hardly know that I have it on), and safety (no more wrapping of headset cords around the steering wheel, plus the FreeSpeak design allows you to hear out of both ears, even when it is in use, as the product does not fully block the ear canal). One advantage to using a BlueTooth headset that I didn't think about before I purchased the product is the that, due to the fact that you can place the phone up to ten feet away from the headset, it allows you to position the phone in a location that provides better signal (like a window sill) and still use your phone. I use this feature all of the time, as cell coverage in my office is marginal, and placing the phone up on a filing cabinet vastly increases the signal quality. The biggest negative: when I press the 'answer/hang up' button on the FreeSpeak to answer an incoming call, my Nokia phone answers the call and then immediately terminates the connection. I have sent email messages to Jabra about this but have not received a response (over a week ago). The second biggest negative: so far, Jabra tech support is AWOL. Using the button to terminate calls works fine. Another niggling problem has to do with the phone and headset occasionally losing contact with one another, which is easily corrected by pressing the headset's 'phone' button. Overall, I highly recommend this product to anyone that is a frequent headset user (and that owns a BlueTooth compatible phone). Setup was a breeze (about 2 minutes), the device works as advertised (mostly), and the quality and comfort are exceptional.",connectivity,positive,positive
"This product was different (bigger) than the exact same model that I ordered previously... But it works well. Protects the phone and easy to access. It has a much larger velcro patch which makes a lot of noise when opening it. And, like the previous model, it has started to tear across the top stitching of the belt clip. Good for the price (which is great because you'll need to order a new one every 4 - 6 months when the belt clips tears free).",price,neutral,neutral

"What a disappointment this phone has been. I've been using it for heavy business use (4,000 minutes a month and unlimited data plan - averaging 1,500-3,000 MB of data transfers a month). I switched to Verizon after 12+ years with AT&T/Cingular because of this phone and the EVDO network. Now I am stuck with a $500 paperweight and a $175 cancellation fee to go back to Cingular. The good: The EVDO network and a small piece of software called ""PDAnet"" which lets you use the Treo as a broadband modem for your laptop or PDA. The Verizon wireless sync made it pretty easy to set up my own ""push server"" without hassling with my internal IT group, but it does need to be rebooted every week or so or it will simply stop forwarding emails.

"I've been using this phone for about 5 days now and the thing that bothers me the most is that the ringtones are too quiet (can't hear the phone ring in a loud restaurant) and there is no Vibrate & Ring at the same time option. It can only Vibrate THEN Ring. The vibrate is also really weak. So if you're like me and you hate missing calls, maybe you should look at some other models. However, the construction is solid and the phone looks real slick. I believe its the smallest phone that Verizon currently offers and possibly the best looking. The reception on this thing is also clear and up to par with my older Audiovox CDM-9900. Pros: -Small and Stylish -Good battery life -Extendable antenna -Clear earpiece -Easy navigation Cons: -Low volume ringers -Weak Vibrate -No Speakerphone -Setting the Call ringer to vibrate does not set the message notification to vibrate, its a separate control. So you could be in a meeting and get a text message which will make your phone ring even though you set the call ringer to vibrate. Be careful. One tip about transferring phonebook entries over to your new phone. If you ask the right person/right store, you can get all your phone numbers transferred from your old phone to your new phone in a matter of minutes. The Circuit City I went to had this machine where they connect both phones (old and new) at the same time and do the transfer. This saves ALOT of time!",price,neutral,neutral

"This is easily the best Bluetooth product available on the market! PERIOD! I thought it was going to be a fair product, but after trying this thing out, I was VERY impressed! Wow is all I can really say. I'm using the speaker that it came with and I can't believe how loud it gets. I was worried that I was going to be getting a cheap speaker with this product but...not the case at all! The calls you make are crystal clear and the people on the other end really think you're using your phone handset. Most people are shocked when I tell them that they are in fact on a speakerphone. It's a truly amazing product! Kudos to Motorola for this awsome item! I can't imagine driving my car without it! And for those people that complain about not being able to have a private call, well all you have to do it take 2 seconds and go into your phone and shut off bluetooth. Or if you want to use a bluetooth headset to make a private call, well then all you have to do is go into your phone and disable the car kit set. It's that simple. I elected to not have the sound go thru my car speakers only for the fact that I'm lazy and don't want to mess with all of my amps. Actually it doesn't even take that much. You don't even have to have the unit automatically mute the sound on your sound system! It's awesome! Amazing! I'm buying one for my other cars this week! I love it!! Gd.",audio,positive,positive

As far as the H9 goes, it is without a doubt, the worst headset I've owned. It's absolutely useless outdoors, even in low wind, unless you just want to irritate whoever you're talking to.

"This Bluetooth headset is way better than the Jawbone (1 or 2) for many reasons such as: -It doesn't require the unit to be touching your jaw bone or cheek at all -It's a lot easier to put on and take off -It's more comfortable and doesn't fall off as easily -It' has two selectable levels of noise cancellation -It's firmware update-able -It has wind noise suppression -It's cheaper yet audio quality both to callers and to you are about the same. Noise cancellation is about equal -It has a full 2 year warranty I'm quite happy with the Blue Ant Z9i and definitely recommend it over the Jawbone. This would be the headset to get if you want background noise to be very minimal or non-existent. My only issue is that BlueAnt only provides the firmware update software to Windows users.

"I just returned my T-Mobile wing after a week and a half of solid use. It had a lot of strong points but some major drawbacks ruined the deal. First, those shopping for a device like this are probably looking for a fairly quick data connection. I'm sad to say that T-mobile just isn't up to par with any other, major carrier when it comes to data speeds. It's not a trivial kinda of difference eitther. Verizon has speeds on their phones that are nearly as fast or faster than DSL. With this phone it's barely comparable to a dial-up modem. Forget about Skype, forget about streaming video. It just doesn't happen at those speeds. From a business perspective this device is very solid. Windows Mobile 6.0 offers a few crucial changes over 5.0 but the applications are what won me over. It's nearly a fully functional desktop version of Excel in this bad boy. The version of Word is top of the line as well. Outlook functionality is stellar, and... it even browses Sharepoint sites (with some limitations). As far as the physical device itself, I have some gripes. When using it horizontally with the keyboard slid open, the screen feels very fragile and the device feels fragile over all in your hands when using it this way. I could predict that the sliding functionality would break in the very near future.. .it didn't feel sturdy in that actiona t all. The keyboard is virtually flat, which sucks if you are typing anything other than an extremely quick text. There is no 3.5mm audio jack, it's USB and Bluetooth only. That' sunfortunate because this thing is just about the right size to replace your iPod with, and with memory cards getting as big as they are it's not such a bad alternative. Plus the Win Media Player is very cool and very comprehensitve on this guy. It can be controlled from the home menu The overall feel of the device is great. The case is not smooth and plasticy, it's textured and has a soft feel that would obviously show fewer nicks and dings than your standard PDA. Also, just in case you wondered, the color is not as bad as it appears online. It's a very deep, dark, bluish-purple with a metallic sheen. I can see this device having serious merit for somebody with smaller hands since it isn't that much longer than a RAZR. In the end I sent the device back because it's Wi-Fi module failed. Let me tell you this up front... T-Mobile, not very good at technical troubleshooting. Wouldn't recommend you even bother. I made it through 3 levels of Technical support for the guy to tell me that it must be my wireless setup, despite the fact that my friend was able to connect with his T-Mobile Dash, and the Wing wasn't able to connect to ANY wi-fi connection after the first day. That's T-mobile though, I doubt you'll have success troubleshooting with any carrier on that note. The real story here is that mine was prone to defects within 48 hours of standard use. Overall, I'd recommend it. I'm sure they would have recalled the device by now if everybody was having the wi-fi issues so I guess that's a fairly safe bet. I wasn't able to find evidence of mass defect for wi-fi capabilities on the net. Make sure that you are comfortable with the feel of this device when it's open and the keyboard is in use before you commit to it!",screen,neutral,neutral

"When I first got these headphones, I couldn't believe the sound! The bass was amazing, and I've never heard better sound quality. The headphones easily connected to my iPod touch 4g or my phone(not both). These headphones aren't without problems though. For some reason, the bluetooth signal interferes with the wi-fi on my iPod, although it doesn't interfere with the wi-fi on my pc when I connect the headset to it. The headphones feel like they were built for the head of a 6 year old child: I could only wear them a few hours before they put enough pressure on either side of my ears to become too uncomfortable to wear. They say that they can connect to both an mp3 player and a phone at the same time, but the instructions in the manual didn't work to do this. My biggest problem, though, is the fact that the plastic strap that connects the headphones broke after only two weeks. I tried to get them replaced under warranty, but even if they did do warranty work on products purchased online, this particular problem is considered ""physical damage"", and isn't covered under warranty.

"I purchased this headset from Amazon 12/4 and received it promptly 12/5. I used this headset all weekend both on my phone and laptop and I am overall very impressed. I chose this headset for a couple reasons. The biggest factor in my decision was that I was looking for a stereo bluetooth headset that I could fit in my pocket. I had no idea if they made a headset that was what I call ""convertible."" In other words, I wanted one that I had the choice of one ear operation or both. When I found this headset and I saw it's design, it was EXACTLY how I would have designed a headset to fit my needs. Second, I wanted a good brand. There are few companies who deliver a good product as consistently as Plantronics. I paired this headset with my Motorola Droid. When I removed the headset from the packaging, I was extremely surprised at the quality of the packaging and that it came with a little pleather pouch for storing the headset and extra earpiece for stereo sound. Call quality is excellent, and the extra earpiece provides great isolation for talking in a noisy area like a restaurant. It's great to be able to answer and end calls by sliding the boom forward and backwards. Some online reviews stated that they felt they would pull it out of their ear when using the boom, but the boom on my earpiece has an extremely easy sliding action. Without a hook or anything I never felt this was going to come out of my ear. The only problem that I have encountered is that the mic is very sensitive. It picks up sounds in your environment and has absolutely zero ambient noise cancelling ability. It also distorts if you talk too loud. I have used this headset all weekend to listen to Slacker Radio, and it has never sounded better. My Zune HD Headphones I was using before had alot of distortion when plugged into my headphone jack and listening to Slacker. I thought it was the quality of the music coming through the program, but it was definitely the headphones. I paired this headset with my laptop as well. The sound quality, in my opinion, is excellent in games and when watching video. Also, the mic is great for my online courses when asking questions or during discussions. As I said, I removed a star for the mics lack of ambient noise cancelling ability, but everything else about this headset is awesome.

"This is the first review I've written on Amazon. Normally, the items I buy from Amazon have 4-5 stars. I got my Jawbone from ATT, and I'm surprised to see it get such low ratings on Amazon. Fit: I have to say that for the first 2 days, the JB was uncomfortable. My ear would hurt after an hour of wearing it, and I was forced to change ears. However, after that I've gotten used to it and don't even notice that it (the Jawbone) is in my ear. Battery: I get a good 3-4 hours of talk time on my Jawbone, which is more than enough for me. So usually I charge my JB every 3-4 calls with my gf. Charging: It cannot get any simpler charging my Jawbone with the nice magnetic feature between the charger and the Jawbone. I'm always on the computer, so every so often I would hook my JB up to the charger. Quality: The Jawbone is looks very sleek and much more appealing than any other Bluetooth headsets on the market. The case and packaging that it came in just screams high quality item. Sound: The Jawbone has clear and crisp sound, I have no problems hearing the other party, so long that I have decent reception. The other party never makes any negative comment on my voice. I talk with my gf mostly on the phone, and she always asks me whether or not I'm using my Jawbone. Pairing: The Jawbone pairs instantly with my Treo 755p. I have my phone set up so that it will enable the Bluetooth whenever I receive or make calls. At which time, I power on my Jawbone, and they pair immediately. I really hope that my review will sway more people in at least trying out this product before they take all these negative reviews to heart. Like I said, I don't normally take the time to write reviews, so I really hope that this will make an impact on other peoples' decision for purchasing the Jawbone.",connectivity,positive,positive
"I had Tmobile earlier and swtiched to verizon just bcos i was fascinated with the features this phone was offering...but once i got this phone today...i m totally displeased..The phone is BULKY..its fat and long with a longer antenna. I had v300 earlier and I thought it was thick but this thing turned out to be thicker. Silver/Black combo ..doesnt suit my taste atleast ...more or less looks similar to v600. Features are pretty decent,1.2 MP camera,mp3 player..which i haven't tested yet. As others say Bluetooth is just an exageration,thanks to Verizon. The best part is its screen,its biiiiiiiiiig, but the sad part is you(at least I) cannot press the * and # keys easily as its tooo far for your thumb. The outer screen shuts off in 5 secs ruffly..you cant even see the time as in v300 or v600. Infacct you have to press one of the buttons to see that. Verizon doesnt ship it with ANY GAMES AT ALL...I spent an hour searching for games which weren't there at all. I even tried the Motorola Mobile phone tools with the USB, sadly,even that was not able to transfer pics and ringtones in and out of phone, as was poss in v300. I seriously don't understand the problem with verizon,why it crippled it to an absolute NOTHING!. The flip opens and closes with force...ie it doesnt open up easily and smoothly.it just pushes on you( might not be a big deal but you do it for 10 mins and you minght end up injuring your thumb). I seriously doubt if it will fit in my jeans pocket..its so damn long, I only wish people don't misunderstand such a bulky thing in my pocket for something else...:-? Its a average peice,nothing awesome about it,but if you are a newbie to camera phones, this might be just for you. Think once before you buy! MOST IMP THING!!! Make sure your contract ends on your old service before porting number to the new service,or else you might end up paying a termination fee. I was about to pay $200 for porting 4 days before expiry of my contract,but long hours of calls to customer care on Tmobile & Verizon saved me from that. T Mobile cust care dint tell me , when last time I asked them about the details of porting.",connectivity,neutral,neutral
"I have been using the parrot minikit for over a month now. As stated in other reviews the instruction manual is absolutely awful. Since this unit doesn't have a digital display, it is important that the user understand the menu hierarchy. However, the instructions do not provide anything that resembles a diagram that may guide the user in programming the unit. Eventually, after much stumble, lurch and fall - I was able to to adjust all of the settings. Aside from this- the unit works well with my Sprint Razr. It read my contacts with minimum fuzz. I was not able to enter the keywords for my contacts but it pronounces the names entered in the contacts. The pronunciation is not clear and it takes some getting used to understanding the contacts' names. At this point, I feel that I got my money's worth",screen,neutral,neutral

"The sound clarity is excellent. I had a Jabra 250, but this one has much better sound clarity. It is very light-weight and fits comfortably over the ear. The volume could stand to be a little louder. I would definitely recommend this item to others!",audio,positive,positive
"Although this item accomplishes its intended purpose, it does not do so without flaw. I can't complain, since it cost less than $5 shipped, but for anyone interested in purchasing this, know that it has a few minor issues. First, the fit is a little snug, both at the connection to the phone and at the headphone jack. Over time, the phone connection has loosened up a little, but I did worry at first that I might damage my phone with this device. I still worry that I'll strip the gold plating off of my headphones with excessive use. That said, no damage has occurred to this point. I also worry a little about the strength of the short length of wire, as it is very thin and weak-looking. Again, no damage yet, but there is some reason for concern. The only other gripe I have about this is that the sound quality is a little lacking. Music is a little quieter coming through this than through the handsfree device that came with the phone, and the sound is definitely less rich, but that's much less noticeable once the volume is increased. All in all, it was worth the money, since I didn't pay much, and because it doesn't have a call button for me to accidentally bump. It's also nice to have less wire to deal with, so I don't have to use the short-wire headphones that came with the phone or tie off extra wire. All in all, worth the price, but don't expect too much.",accessories,neutral,neutral

"I ordered this phone just as a back-up to my current smartphone but I liked it so much that I used it as my primary phone for a few days. Size is nice and compact, fits well into any pocket. The battery life is phenomenal and that is expected because its a 1000+ mAh for a very basic phone. The features are decent and the bluetooth pairs very well with my external bluetooth devices such as the Motorola speakerphone in my car. Menu and options are basic and quite easy to use. Screen resolution is so-so but then what do you expect from a phone at this price. Overall, even though I went back to my smartphone a few days later (only because of my dependency on its features) I highly recommend this phone to those who need only voice + text. This is an excellent device and I will be more than happy to use it again if I ever need a back-up phone or if I go out on one of those rough outdoor adventures.",audio,positive,positive

"I did my research before buying, and in general, this clearly was the headset of choice. After receiving it and using it, I'm so glad I made the purchase. What's there not to love - it's tiny, it's lightweight, it has good sound quality, it picks up your voice well, great battery life (at 6 hours it's much longer than my cell phone), it uses the same charger as my Blackberry (one less charger to lug around), it was $40 off retail from Amazon, once it's on my ear I usually forget it's there. And it comes in different colors. You toggle this device on and off (power on vs power off) by opening/closing the small boom microphone. It's challenging to do this while it's on your ear, but I'm not sure why you'd do that anyway if you're wearing it. Overall, a great little quality headset. 2 thumbs up from me.",battery,positive,positive
"Sorely disappointed. Wanted a replacement for the LG I tried out and returned. I liked the LG but the volume wouldn't adjust below ""loud"" on my iphone even on the lowest settings on the phone and the device. So I tried these headphones when I found them, hoping they would do what the LGs wouldn't. It was off to a good start as the volume adjusted low enough for me, and the buds were comfortable. I didn't get to fully test the functionality because I read the manual next. Nowhere on the packaging does it indicate that these buds aren't for use while exercising, or that they can't be exposed to rain or sweat. You have to get to the back of the owner's manual for that information. Even if I don't wear these for my runs during the summer, I can't even wear them to the gym without worrying that they will be ruined. Nor can I wear them anywhere a sudden rainstorm might break out. I understand that there is a sweat resistant version out there, and I may look into it, but I wish this product was advertised for what it is - a headset for sedentary, indoor music lovers. Active or outdoorsy people beware.",shipping,negative,negative
"When I purchased this one I thought it be great to be able to share. What I found was it would lock on to a signal, show all the bars on my phone. But it would not always connect. It did work in some areas that wouldn't work without booster. So to be fair it did help. I did have my Cyfre booster to compare. It actually would work in some areas the Wllson 801201 could not connect. I did return the Wilson 801201 wireless. I later obtained a Wilson direct connect 810210 using a Wilson cradle. I found it to connect where Cyfre couldn't find any signal. So I would say the Wilson 810210 is the best for RV camping. I would say if your in an area that the signal is just a little weak this wireless will be fine, you may find that the inside antenna needs to be only a few inches away, if your in a very weak signal area. Read my Wilson cradle review for more details about wilsom direct connect 810210.",connectivity,neutral,neutral
"When it works correctly, this unit is fantastic! But it seems to have a mind of it's own. Voice commands works part of the time or is very slow to react.

"I am disappointed. I had been wanting to purchase the Jawbone headset ever since it was first released as a wired version, but it was not compatible with the cell phone that I was using. I was ecstatic when they released a blue tooth version, and waited a bit for any bugs to be worked out, and for my old bluetooth headset to ""die"", which it did a couple of weeks ago. To make a long story short, I am deeply disappointed by the Jawbone head set. The first one that I received did not function as advertised; I wasn't certain if it was defective or if the geometry of my face was just ""wrong"" somehow, but I returned it for a replacement. The replacement does not work correctly either. I tried every fitting that I could: the standard and long ear loops on both ears, and all four of the ear pieces in every combination, with no discernible difference. I've returned it for a refund, and will be ordering a different headset (maybe two for the same price) when the refund goes through.",price,neutral,negative
"This equipment was difficult to set up, very slight adjustments to antenna placement made a huge difference in performance. Also found that weather and time of day affected (source) signal strength making it a complex problem to solve. I ended up running up a 35 foot antenna on the west most corner of my house using a PVC extension and I pretty much always have signal in the house. The antenna can't be connected to metal, the coax must be grounded, there must be at least 15 feet vertical distance from antenna and amp (my personal experience is that 25 verical feet wasn't enough), amp must be located near ceiling and away from electrical wires (in wall or ceiling ... & other EMF generating equipment) and after all that, it sort of works. My source signal is weak so the amplified signal doesn't travel far within my house but at least we can text and talk in one or two rooms of the house. It's expensive but for a family that's used to having cell phone service it's an option worth considering.",price,neutral,neutral
"I am adding this paragraph after owning this battery for about 12 months: For a time, I was having trouble with this battery. It would die and only wake up when plugged in to a charger. Then it would immediately show at least a half charge, sometimes more. However, this glitch has gone away and it is working OK again. Here's a possible user error: I was charging a failing iPhone 3 and it had lots of other problems besides a weak battery. It's possible that one of the problems with that phone was a short or near short in the charging jack. I would have done some experimentation but then my daughter gave me her iPhone 5 in exchange for an iPad. I am having no further problems with this battery now that I am charging a known good device. My advice, from this single experience, is to give this product a try if you like it, or another New Trent external battery. They answer emails and offered to evaluate this battery after I started having problems, but I decided not to bother since the problems have now stopped. I'm raising my rating back to 4 stars, and if the problems don't come back at all, I'll raise it back to the original 5 stars I had on this review initially (below). My iPhone 3Gs needed a new battery. I researched all the options and videos about how to replace it and decided that this product would satisfy my needs for now. My internal battery lasts about 4 hours and then I have to plug this in to recharge it. My battery has such little reserve that this product charges it in less than an hour. Typically, I don't even have to use the phone during this time, but if I do, the cord is no problem to have connected. I can charge my phone at least 3 times before I have to recharge this product. One peculiarity is that you can't charge the unit with a 30-pin (or Lightning) cord. You must use the micro-USB cord supplied (or another one like it) and charge from any standard USB jack (computer or brick that you would use to charge the iPhone or iPod). The reason is that the manufacturer would have had to pay license fees to Apple to use that jack, so instead they have one micro-USB jack to charge it from (power in) and another standard USB to connect to your phone (power out). This doesn't bother me and it probably knocked a dollar off the price. But, you do have to have that other connector handy to recharge this battery. Others complained that the unit wouldn't charge up fully. I find that it will charge fine if you fully cycle it. I don't recharge it when it's only partly discharged. It has 4 status lights and I wait until only one light is showing to recharge it. The unit will turn itself off after 30 seconds of no load, or you can turn it off manually after checking the status. I have not tried to both charge it and use it at the same time, which some dongle-type external batteries encourage you to do, but it would be an awkward mess to have both cords attached. This is definitely for your pocket, not for holding or attaching to your phone.",accessories,positive,positive
"I got this item a few days ago. I use it with my iPod touch (you have to get an application from the app store that will support your ipod.

My only concern is that the volume is quite low when you record, which another reviewer mentioned as well. I would rather have good quality than loud volume though.",build_quality,positive,positive
"PLEASE, PLEASE READ MY WHOLE ARTICLE BEFORE BUYING ANY BOOSTER SYSTEMS. I purchased this booster some time ago, Oct 2009. Upon installation, I did not see any improvement. I contacted Wi-Ex and after a few days of bitching, they sent me a new system. The new system was a bit better but still did not do what they claim it to do. I've continued to use this booster for 8 months total now and here is my analysis. First, they claim that this unit will cover a home of 2500 sq ft. LIE. Second, they claim that this will reduce dropped calls... HALF A LIE Here are the facts: 1- You will only get a boosted signal from the base unit ONLY if the receiving antenna has a strong signal. I have 2 bars in my attic, where the receiving antenna is installed, and the coverage range from the base unit is only anywhere from 2 inches to 3 feet from the base unit. 2- In my situation, the coverage area dramatically drops as soon as I'm out of the 3 foot radius of the base unit. As soon as I'm about 10 feet from the base unit, the signal will drop to zero bars on my phone (Palm Pre) and the phone will intermittently switch to Roaming. (This also occurs with an HTC Touch Pro 2 as well). I contacted Wi-Ex and they told me that the max range of the boosted signal will be 15 feet. That's right, he said 15 feet. They why do they advertise full house coverage? And also claim a 2500 sq ft home coverage on this unit. I was also told that if my input signal is only two bars, that the output from the base unit is reduced to a lower radius/range. This is not what is advertised. As a matter of fact, while I was on the phone with the rep, he kept asking me to repeat myself because I kept breaking up. He asked me to repeat myself three times, yes, three times, and my distance to the base unit? About two feet at that time and the bar strength indication on the phone? That was at 1 bar!! Yes, 1 bar!!! So basically, if you have full bars (a strong signal) outside of your home, then the boosted signal inside your home will be greater. I want everyone to know this. DO NOT BE MISGUIDED!!!! This system is only as good as your signal outside your home. If you have FULL strength outside your home and have no signal strength inside your --- a basement for example, then, you will have good coverage in your basement room ONLY. Also, I wanted to troubleshoot this some more so I bought a Wilson 800/1900 booster. Identical to this Wi-Ex unit. I tried a combination of several things. I used the Wi-Ex receiver with the Wilson base and the Wilson transmitting antenna, the Wilson receiving antenna with the Wi-Ex base unit and the Wilson antenna and so forth..... and this is what I learned: The Wilson system gives you a better coverage radius than the Wi-Ex unit. However, the Wilson unit continuously loses it's signal and the base unit's LED will switch from green to amber to red quite often! Again, neither of these units really improves your indoor signal if your outdoor signal is not at 100%. DO NOT EXPECT YOUR INDOOR RECEPTION TO BE BOOSTED THROUGHOUT YOUR ENTIRE 2500 SQ FT HOME!! This will NOT happen. These two units are misrepresented to make a sale. This is not to say that the Wilson is a better buy, it is not! The coverage radius is only increased by about 1 foot using the Wilson unit. As soon as you are out of this range, your signal will drop and switch over to Roaming as well. Do not waste your money on either of these two systems if all you need is coverage at your computer desk. You might as well buy their lower priced units that you suction cup to your window. These will give you that same result and you don't have to climb into your attic or bore holes in your home to hang an external antenna. More importantly, they cost about $100 less. I have disconnected both units and the signal strength at my desk is at 2 bars without a booster. (Intermittently of course but good enough and better than with the boosters in place). I of course, lose my signal in the basement, but the boosters didn't provide me with better signal strength either so for me, it's not a loss. Note: I did abide by the distance requirements called for by each manufacture and those called for by the FCC. I only operated my cell in close proximity only to perform my tests. At no time should you operate your equipment outside the limitations set forth in the user's manuals.",price,negative,negative
"Do not purchase a Jawbone 2. In two month's time, I have had to replace the J2 twice. Amazon (good customer service) just agreed to accept the return of the second unit and refund the purchase price. The first J2 arrived defective: some of the earpieces were missing and the headphone dropped every second word. Aliph agreed to replace the first unit, but the replacement process was slow and expensive. First, I had to wait for an authorizing email - which took a couple of days to arrive. Then, I had to return the defective unit at my cost. Then Aliph took over a week to return the replacement. The replacement headphone never worked that well, but was initially functional. However, it has now failed and transmits only about 60-70% of my side of the conversation. Reception with both the first and second unit was not a problem, but the J2 is worthless if you actually want the other person to hear you. The original Jawbone (predecessor to the currently shipping J2) worked very well, except when there was any wind. The first original Jawbone I purchased also fell apart within 2 weeks of purchase, but was replaced by Aliph with no objection and no problem. The replacement original Jawbone worked very well and lasted well over a year, before it died completely. When I contacted Aliph regarding the failure of the second J2, Aliph refused to replace it with anything but another J2, which is clearly a defective product. I suspect that is the reason Aliph is now shipping the replacement Jawbone Prime. Don't waste time or money purchasing a J2. First, it is a defectively designed product and Aliph's customer service simply isn't. The only reason the J2 receives one star is because it is not possible to give it a zero.",audio,negative,negative

"I dig the concept. I use the iGo system for all my mobile devices, and it's great for the most part. But inevitably, these particular plugs stop working for some reason, differentiating them from the other tips in the system. Some last longer than others, but I've replaced these a few times over the last few years. I use them in the car for my phone, mostly, so they get a fair bit of use - perhaps plugging and unplugging about once per day on average, and that's considerably more than, say, my iPod power tip. I'm a DIY type that insists on fixing things until they just refused to be fixed anymore, and even I can't bring these back when they poop out. It seems connectivity stops happening inside the unit, either because they bend slightly out of shape or short out. Sometimes the wiggle method keeps them somewhat functional for a little while, but then they deteriorate into only being functional when you prop them or hold them *just so* to keep the charge running - and that's a serious pain in the ascending colon to be futzing with while driving. There are tiny metal prongs on the inside of the plug that disappear or flatten out, and that seems to be the problem, but even getting in there with a tiny tool and reshaping them doesn't seem to help. Opening up a dead one didn't yield any insight either. They are cheap. That's a plus. And they are part of a neat system that minimizes all the peripheral pluggage. But I'm morally opposed to the continual replacement of cheap plastic and electronics and feeding the landfills with e-waste. Even though these are tiny, they contribute to that problem, so you may want to hold out on this particular type of mini-usb for the iGo unless you can differentiate between one that is made better and one that is not - which is something that I haven't been able to determine just yet. There do seem to be different model numbers for the same type of plug though, so more research is necessary.",battery,neutral,neutral

I wanted something PDA-like but not a treo (I have a palm and well PalmOne's OS has not really evolved). I wanted something that wasn't too pricey and at 199 the Q worked. The basics are great (i can make calls, the person on the other end can hear me, the speakerphone works well)and the price point -- also great. However the screen is bright but barely seeable in bright sunlight (which may be a bit of a problem considering it's portable and people are prone to make calls -- outside). I find myself often looking for shade to see which contact is highlighted or which app is highlighted. The battery fully charged barely lasts 6 hours. The extended battery which I purchased after realizing this fact, lasts a robust 9ish hours. Of course the problem I have is that it's not like I am talking for a considerable amount of that time --- generally my day consists of a few (maybe 3 or 4) calls, that last a few minutes each (maybe 7 or 8 minutes top). I find myself rushing home, hoping the battery will last until I can get home and charge up the phone. Some minor qualms about the Q are the covers for the miniSD slot and headphone jack, the button sensitivity and the lack of software (the version of windows mobile 5.0 used on the Q is a hybrid of the windows mobile OS used for the treo et al). The covers for the slots are crappy and will probably break off soon. The buttons are really sensative, I have to be careful when it's in my purse or pocket as a slight brush results in the camera coming on with the flash or random dialing from the contact page. Overall -- I've seen worst but the Q hasn't lived up to the hype and I hope there are some serious improvements in the work for the GSM version.",price,neutral,neutral
"I bought the BlueAnt ST3 months ago...Most people don't like to talk to me while I am on this device because they say it sounds really bad going out...Sucks too because it costs around $90-100. Anyway, I must say the voice quality coming in is pretty good, although as in some other reviews, sometimes the volume goes really loud, then really soft for no reason. There is some good potential with this device, just needed a little more time in development IMO. I read reviews before getting this, which at the time were only about 10 reviews. I probably would not get it again: Pros: -Functionally it CAN upload your phones phone book (only certain models -not listed). -Voice quality coming in is decent -Wireless. -Voice command dialing. Cons: -Bad other-end voice quality from what EVERYONE is teling me -Does not upload every phones phonebook...I am willing to bet that the list for UNSUPPORTED Phones w/ bluetooth is far higher than SUPPORTED phones to transfer the phonebook -Volume goes up and down sometimes for no reason. -Sometimes the voice answer doesn't work (even though this is normally a great feature) -It does read out the number (or name if stupid phonebook functionality worked) of the caller -Buttons can get confusing (even though there are only two it's another one of those, hold button for 5 seconds for this, 3 seconds for that, 1 second to call, 10 seconds to turn off, whatever...great there are only two buttons, but it's still difficult to remember how to do everything) Ok - so overall, I would not recommend getting this bluetooth device, unless you have first called someone who has it and have a listen for yourself..If you catch yourself saying ""I didn't get that"" or ""say that one more time"" or ""this device is junk"" more than 2 times, then it's garbage. HAHA...ok, this is way too harsh of a review...but I am just telling it how it is...I have heard good things about the cheaper BlueAnt light...for half the price - get that if you can live w/out the ""extra features""...I bought this cause I am a techy nerd, but it just doesn't support all the functions it CLAIMS and I have had on numerous occasions bad experiences talking using this device...AThankYouVeryMuch",build_quality,neutral,neutral
"The good thing about this headset is that I can hear well and that I can also be heard well by the person on the other end. However, I have had two problems with this headset. The first was difficulty transferring sounds from my phone when I received a call - somtimes when I would press the button on the headset, it would answer the call, but the sounds came through the phone instead of the headset. After a few days, this problem seemed to go away. The second is ongoing. When the headset gets low on power (which seems to be very quickly), it does not make any sound or give any other indication, except to stop transferring sounds from the phone to the headset. This can happen in the middle of a call, without any warning. This is my first Bluetooth, so maybe some of these problems are typical. I have not been particularly impressed thus far, though.",connectivity,neutral,neutral
"There are no accessories at all that come in the box, except for the phone charger. Just a couple of ringtones. menu options are bad and cannot be customized. phone does not have good sound. the speaker phone sucks! not clear or loud enough.

Bad Sound - this is the main feature of a phone, this con outweighs all the good stuff about this phone.",accessories,negative,neutral
"For me the sound quality is by far the most important factor when I compare headsets. Everything else is secondary. I drive a very noisy construction van so background noise is a serious problem. I have compared 8 different headsets and the Plantronics Voyager 510 is the only one that allows a clear conversation in this environment. I have used it daily for over 2 years and often for 6+ hours straight until the battery is dead. In a loud, dirty, construction environment, often lying on the ground, it's the only thing I've found that works. With the other models, either I, the caller, or both of us couldn't understand a word being said. For those of you that don't have background noise issues, I can add that even in quiet settings this unit has better sound quality than all the others that I tested. The way that I do my tests is to pair 2 headsets, put one in each ear and then switch between them while on the same call. This way I and the caller can compare the sound quality at almost the exact same time. The 2 cons I can mention are that the on/off button is too small and hard to push, and that when the battery is almost dead the buttons stop working (even though the sound continues fine) so you have to hang up using the phone instead of the headset. To be fair though, the ""almost dead battery"" symptoms happen in many of the other ones I've tested also. I don't care, sound is everything.",audio,positive,positive

"I bought this for my Mother who had her original factory charger come apart. It's works (worked - see below for explanation) just fine and for the price is fantastic. So it has been a two months and these fall apart like wet toilet paper. I have purchased 3 hoping that the first was just a assembly line goof up, but they really are cheaply constructed. After two of these have come apart at the connection to the phone, I did some preemptive work on the connection and used silicone glue to try and keep the part from pulling apart. It didn't hold very long. The price is great if you are willing to buy one every few weeks, but in a short amount of time, it adds up to the cost of an OEM charger (the one that came with the phone last two years). If you do buy one of these, be certain to stretch out the coiled wire so that you have some extra length, because if you don't then the connector will come apart the first time you pull the phone towards your ear.",price,negative,negative

"I bought a battery for my Motorola phone because the 15 month old battery wasn't holding a charge. The new battery arrived quickly (good vendor) and the price was significantly better than the local Verizon dealer (good value). However, this is my 4th personal Motorola phone (5th when you add in business phones) and despite following a careful charging process as instructed by my phone dealer, the batteries have never lasted very long. This purchase will get me to my ""new every two"" date when I plan, after many years with the brand, to switch away from Motorola. I'm not happy about having to do that but with the history of the poor battery life with my 4 phones and my wife's 2 Motorola, I will go to another brand.

"Regarding this iPod wall charger... --- I wondered why the same product kept coming up with different prices. Maybe because they want to hide poor reviews and keep starting fresh? The first time I plugged it into my iPod, for a few minutes the backlight of the iPod turned on, but not the text. Then the light went off and I was not able to get the iPod to respond again for two hours. It was dead. I made sure the lock switch was off, I tried to reset, I plugged it in using the Apple brand charger that has been working fine...but nothing worked. It was gone. --- Perhaps it was a coincidence that, despite the iPod working fine for two years (including a couple of hours on a flight just yesterday), the first time I plugged it in to charge with this product, it died. However, it also seems possible that this product provided the wrong electrical supply to the iPod and fried it, at least temporarily. I don't feel like trying it on other iPods to test this theory, though. --- I thought I was getting a good deal by buying this for 1 cent and paying $4.99 shipping and handling. Now I realize the ploy - there is no reason to return it for a $0.01 refund, and shipping is not refunded. --- I urge people to avoid this product.",accessories,negative,negative

Let me tell you first that I used LG HBS-730 for a while now but I was attracted by the stronger wires these headset seems to have. I am very disappointed by the product mainly due to conception flaws. I did not give 1 star due to the fact that I like there is a bit of competition on this niche. The good: - good range - wires seems more sturdy than on LG The bad: - the power button is hardly accessible - the power led is useless as you can not say if the product is on of off - no error sound - it makes the same sound if connected successfully or if it disconnect; - vague confirmation sound - same sound when you short press the answer button (nothing happened) and when you long press the answer button (voice command is opened) - voice confirmation is just for starting the headset - no notification when connection is lost - poor sound quality,audio,negative,negative
"I bought this pay as you go phone b/c I was tired of getting stuck with contracts. The design is very nice on this phone but I've had it for about a year now and the black circular button on the keypad slowly kept chipping and finally broke completely off and there is indentions in the buttons from my finger nails. Having the camera is a nice feature but when I forward the pics to my email they come out way too dark. I don't know if I'm alone on this but when people forward pics to me, half the time I can't open them- or I open them and all I have is a small black ""X""...yet I waste minutes trying to open them. So now when someone sends a pic, I don't even try to open them since I don't want to piss my money away. A few others have mentioned that it takes a bit of time to send texts which is true (which is what I mostly use my phone for), I use my home phone to make calls.

I use a wall adapter to charge it, and it takes about 8 hours to charge. It does NOT charge my iPad 3. When plugged into my iPad, it keeps the iPad battery from draining any further, but does not charge it during use.

"I am an owner for over 8 months now and have a love and hate relationship with it. A full list of pros and cons would take pages -- i scraped it after less than half way -- so I will try to point out some important strengths and pitfalls. My suggestion to anyone who is considering the 650: note what features are must-haves to decide. if it's a close call, wait for something else. there are quite a few new products that are likely to be better next year. The Good: ergonomics; build quality; the screen (the BEST on any handheld i have ever seen, and i have seen many PPCs and Nokias); very usable keyboard; decent phone audio quality; and lastly being used as a modem over BlueTooth. Sprint now officially allows the 650 to be used as a modem, so with a bluetooth adapter, you can literally get on the net from ANYWHERE. This is much better than searching for hotspot with Wifi. The Bad: phone application still needs more work (no dial by letters??); camera quality is still quite poor (very smudgy); PalmOS 5.4 is ill-suited for a convergence device (single-tasking); the included web browser, Blazer, renders pages nicely but is EXTREMELY SLOW in rendering (completely unrelated to download speed); no additional networking applications bundled except web and email (forget about IMing without paying more); very limited main memory for additional applications and few applications run on the expansion card; expect to purchase more software as most (useful) palm applications are not free; the headphone jack is at the BOTTOM, making it difficult to listen to music/phone while keeping the 650 in the pocket; headphone jack is also very fragile that can cause earpiece to malfunction and calls to hang up; voice calls may not come in while data is being used; and finally, yes, it crashes often. Yes, the list of ""bad"" is long but it's still possibly the least worst product of this type right now. While I am bitter with some of the pitfalls that probably shouldn't be there in the first place, for the most part it serves my purpose: being able to get on the net and type with a keyboard just about anywhere and any time. Try doing that with a laptop while waiting at a bus stop.",accessories,neutral,neutral

"Let me say off the bat that I had been REALLY looking forward to getting this phone. I saw a great deal on Amazon and ordered it. However, when I tried to activate the phone it was listed in Sprint's database as a stolen phone! Obviously I sent the phone back to Amazon (along with a curt note!) and then bought one directly from Sprint. I loved it from the moment I took it out of the box... very slim, sleek, and sexy. I spent many, many hours setting up the phone just how I wanted it, including pictures, ring tones, and display preferences. I should have waited until I'd made sure the phone worked. Within a few uses I knew there were problems. Major ones. Over the course of two days I had the phone shut itself off and reboot randomly four times, display the incorrect caller ID and use the wrong ringtone for contacts, have the ringtones sounds like music played on an underwater stereo, and have the picture display show up like an old TV set with bad ""rabbit ears"" (remember those fuzzy, squiggly lines that would appear all over the screen if it wasn't a good signal?). I called Sprint and told them what I was experiencing. They said they hadn't heard of those complaints but would be glad to exchange it for me FOR $55 SINCE I DIDN'T HAVE A REPAIR CONTRACT WITH THEM! After I pointed out how ludicrus that was - charging me to swap a phone that was defective to begin with - they sent me another one free of charge. I was much smarter with the second phone and didn't program anything until I made sure it was working. Guess what? It had the SAME problems. Now I knew it wasn't just a fluke that my old one acted up. I then went to the Net and did some research, and it turns out that many, many people are experiencing the same problems I was (and yet Sprint still says they aren't hearing of these issues, which I find hard to believe). I once again called Sprint and had them send me out a 3rd phone. There was a 2 week gap between ordering and receipt and while I was mad at first that I was stuck for a while with a defective phone, it turned out to be a good thing bacause it allowed me to receive a phone from a new ""lot"". My 3rd A900 hasn't rebooted and hasn't played the incorrect ringtones. I was able to get around the scrambled-looking picture ID's with a tip I'd read from others who had experienced the problem. It occurs on long-distance numbers and apparently putting the ""1"" before the area code confuses the phone; if you remove it then the phone (and picture) works fine. I've now had the new phone for two weeks and think I'll keep it. I had already invested over $100 in accessories before I found out my first one didn't work so I am very hesitant to switch to a new phone (although Sprint offered to swap it out for a different - less expensive! - phone ""at no charge""). I'm going to be downloading my own ringers on to it later today and hope that it doesn't mess up the good thing I've finally got going. In short, if I had to buy this phone again I wouldn't. It's obvious that there are still many bugs and problems with the software and no solutions on the horizon.

"Contrary to other user opinions I have found the V710 to be the best cell phone I have owned. The camera is on par with every other cell phone camera that I've seen. Meaning that this is a cell phone not a digital camera. While Verizon has crippled some of the bluetooth advantages they cannot diminish the quality of this phone. The reception and voice quality far exceeds anything else Verizon offers. Even crippled the bluetooth works flawlessly and is all that the average high use business person or casual user really needs. The display is both large and high definition, with black lettering framed in white. My eye sight isn't the best but with the V710 display I can read everything with a quick glance. The trans-flash expansion card is very small but works as advertised. I would suggest the desktop charger because it does away with the cheap charger plug in on Motorola phones and it has a data port to connect the phone to your computer. If you buy the desktop charger, the data cable, and phone tools 3.0 you can transfer your photos and data easily by just dropping your phone into the charger. Bluetooth is very convenient and one day will do away with wired connections but for now cabled connections are still the most reliable. I could go on and on about the advantages the V710 has over the other Verizon phones but let me sum it up this way: (1) best reception (2) best sound quality (3) top of the line speaker phone (4) excellent display (5) trans-flash expandable memory (6) mediocre camera, but it does take short movie clips (7) very customizable options (8) good size and weight for most people (9) bluetooth connectivity works great for most users (10) plastic, but very solid build quality. Those are the highlights that I've found, try this phone and I think you'll agree and probably find other features you like even more. For $200 at Amazon.com plus a $50 rebate and another $150 rebate down the road, I dare even the biggest critic of the V710 to find a better phone available from Verizon. Let's be honest here, Verizon is the best cellular carrier in the U.S. so we are forced to deal with the phones they offer or settle for dropped calls and static, or no service at all. All the gimics aside we all want clear calls and good reception the V710 and Verizon offer this better than anyone else right now.",performance,positive,positive

Battery life seemed fine - you get four hours and my usage is way lower than that for several days anyway so I never would tax that. A couple of extra points: the power/feature button gets hit all the time putting this on which is annoying as it activates voice command accidentally quite a lot. Also I lost connectivity to the device constantly and it also shut itself off quite a bit. The result being that when calls came in - I often would not get them on the earpiece, but rather on the handset. I belive this is a compatibility issue with my 8130, but it did list it as compliant.

"What is a Regulatory Cost Recovery Fee? It's a charge the phone companies add to your bill to recover a cost they pay to do things the government forces them to. It's composed of several things 1. Fees paid to the FCC. The FCC rakes in money for the things it regulates and cellular phone services is one of those things. 2. Federal TRS service. Cingular must pay a fee to this fund that's used to pay for someone to sit on the other end of a TTY service and ""talk"" to you when the person who's calling you or that you called is deaf. 3. Wireless Local Number Portability and Number Pooling. It use to be in the old days that the local exchange portion of the telephone number (the 555 part of a number such as 1-813-555-1212) routed your phone call to a specific piece of equipment in your neighborhood or to a particular cellular phone company. When we started to have choice is home phone service and more choice in wireless phone service people wanted to be able to keep their number. This service allows them to do that but to implement it the phone companies needed to talk nice to each other and all upgrade their equipment. This is a fee you pay to make sure all the phone companies talk nice to each other. 4. E911. This pays to make sure there's someone who picks up when you dial 911. It is now also supposed to ensure that when you call 911 from a cellular phone the operator can figure out where you are since you're likely not at your home address. Why isn't this just called a ""Tax""? Well, most of it is just money paid to the government to make things happen, but unlike most taxes the money isn't taken from random places and used to pay for random things. It's money taken from a service to pay for things related directly to that service. Additionally some of the money is not paid directly to the government but to quasi governmental groups (they aren't the government, but the government runs them and forces you to pay them). If politicians called these things ""Taxes"" then they wouldn't get elected again. If the phone company simply added the fees to their expenses and increased the costs of your plans then some day one phone company would realize that they could offer a lower priced plan but then just tack on the fees after you've signed up and in essence charge you the same amount. This may also be the phone companies way of saying ""see what you made me do?"" How can they make me? Well, they are the government, they are here to help us. Seriously folks, they are the government. They have the police, the FBI and the IRS on their side. They also have the military if it gets to that point, but really, I don't think they'll go that far over Regulatory Cost Recovery Fees. On our side we have the vote. People said they wanted to have 911 work and to know where they were no matter where they were using their phone and we have it. It costs money one way or another and we either pay the cost recovery fee or alll the phone companies rates go up a little bit. There is a little known secret about these fees though. You don't have to pay the fees. The downside is that the phone company will shut off your service at some point in time for not paying the extra couple of bucks a month, but with number portability you can switch to a new provider for as long as they will let you slide and with the FCC allowing more than two providers in each area you can run that game for some time. Eventually though you'll run out, probably within a year and likely saving no more than a single months . That's why I pay my Regulatory Cost Recovery Fee in full, on time, every month and you should too!",shipping,neutral,negative
"I decided to try this unit after people where complaining of the extra noise of my Plantronics. This audio on this unit is *terrible* it is harsh and not consistent, a lengthy phone call actually hurts. I had the unit replaced by Jawbone and the second unit, while a little better, was nowhere near the audio quality of the other headsets I have used. I never had a long enough call with anyone to see how good it was form their end, but tests I did in my car to voicemail showed the Jawbones voice quality to be subpar, it was low and muffled, where the BT8040 was clean and clear, as was the Plantronics. I won't even get into the freaky buttons. I also think they wasted a ton on the packaging, while real nice, I don't need money spent there. I did like the looks, the cool light (although hidden by the button, so it was very hard to tell when you turned it on) as well as the charging cable. I did not like the way it fit as the ear piece was way too big, and the ear hooks all seemed the same (all four of them) it is very hard to get in your ear, and then harder to get it to fit and seat well. I previously tried a Plantronics 815 and am now using a Jabra BT8040. The other thing I found was that you could buy this directly from their site cheaper than here, or most other places, to undercut your own dealers is real bad. I gave it 2 stars as I thought it looked cool and some of it's design features were cool...

"I bought this cable to use as a backup to the original cable for my Blackberry Bold 9700. I wanted to have a spare syncing/charging cable should anything happen to my original data cable. Despite the price point, I was still hopeful that the cable would be able to get the job done. It delivered on half of my expectations; that half being the data syncing function. For some reason the cable allows me to sync data from my phone to my computer just fine, but it does not charge my device when I plug it into my usb port. This isn't a problem with my phone or my laptop because the cable that came with my phone is able to charge/sync perfectly on my computer. Perhaps I just received a defective cable, but for a couple bucks it's hard to complain too much. The lack of charging ability is a small gripe because all I really have to do is plug my phone into the wall while I sleep and I'm good to go.

This is a nice looking quality device that comes with all the connectors most people will need. The mini is very small about one third the size of the regular power port which isn't very big. I would recommend this device only for emergency back up for a cellphone because I used it on my cellphone and was only able to get 40% more power from a 30% charge. That only gave me 70% total after an hour of charging before it died on me and needed a recharge which takes two hours.

I received this headset today and it works just fine with my Motorola V3 Razr. The earpiece fits in the ear just as good as the ones from the Nokia phone that was replaced by the Razr and the sound quality and volume is great (for speech) as they were intended. I can't really understand why there were some negative reviews for this item -- all I can say is there must be a lot of whiners with small ears.

"Knowing the wide range of reviews of this product, I ordered it anyway and would return it if it really didn't work out. Here's the summary: I spent much of two days trying every possible combination of signal antenna location: inside, outside, 10 feet high, 20 feet high, near a window, in the attic. I followed the instructions and kept the base unit as far away as possible, with as much vertical separation as possible. I oriented the base station antenna vertically and horizontally. Nothing worked. I called Wi-Ex technical support and their recommendation was to buy the additional directional antenna and aim it at one specific tower. I decided I didn't want to spend more and risk still not having the repeater work, so I returned it instead. Now the detail. I did quite a bit of background work. I live in the middle of a nice flat part of Silicon Valley and there is no lack of towers around. My house is a single-story wood frame; no big buildings around and no hills. There are 3 AT&T cell towers within 0.85 miles (I found them and measured distance). The problem is that I happen to be located almost exactly in between and equidistant from these three towers, and apparently their power is adjusted so that they don't overlap a great deal. In other words, I get three sets of signals, none particularly strong, and depending on specific conditions at any moment in time the strongest signal comes from any of these three towers at random. So the phone is constantly hunting for a signal, and rarely gets one very strong for very long. The YX510 repeater uses an omnidirectional signal antenna, in other words it will see all three towers the same way my phone does -- varying in relative signal strength constantly. It will simply repeat that mixed up signal. Furthermore, the YX510 will ratchet its boost down if it detects a strong signal, which happens every once in a while. So it is easy to see what is happening. The repeater cannot help this situation and in fact makes it worse by occasionally ratcheting boost down when it happens to get a short burst of a strong signal. The end result was that my cell reception was no better with the repeater than without -- not better, just ""different"" -- I was stuck more often in Edge than without, but I did often have 2-3 bars as long as I was in line of sight of the base station and no more than 15 feet away. Beyond that, I lost signal. The solution would appear to be to use a directional antenna and aim it at one tower. This would potentially solve these issues: the phone would not hunt between towers and the YX510 would not get a wildly varying signal strength (I think). However, I'm not ready to make that jump yet and will need to do some more research. I was also not very impressed with the construction or the instructions for the YX510. I will want to look at other options (all of which, BTW, are substantially more expensive, but generally the companies offering them have longer track records). The YX510 with omnidirectional signal antenna is probably a good product when there is a single, dominant cell tower nearby. In my case, with multiple equal-strength towers (but at marginal strength), it did not help at all. Since Wi-Ex tech support knew the problem immediately when I described my situation, it appears they are aware of it -- which IMHO means they should make it clearer what the limitations are. The marketing material and the installation guide are written to promote the idea that you just throw the stuff up and it should work. RF just isn't like that. Thanks to Amazon, returning it was easy.",accessories,negative,negative

"I bought the Jawbone early on when it first came out, in part because my existing headset didn't work entirely properly with my newly-bought iPhone. In general, I've found the sound quality to be satisfactory with the Jawbone, though a couple people who have taken calls from me say that my voice sounds rather unnatural, almost computerlike. I think this is attributable to the noise-filtering feature that the Jawbone has been touted for. As I said... the sound quality has been satisfactory, but it could be better. Also, the sound volume is a bit low compared to other headsets I've used. Sound aside, there's really little to like or recommend about this headset. Let's take the ear-clip for starters. The rubberized tip makes it a little difficult to slide on over the ear easily... it tends to grab onto the skin. This makes it very difficult to slap on and answer an incoming call quickly. I generally found myself answering first, yelling ""hold on"", then putting the headset on. Additionally... the ear clips are simply very shoddy in quality. The Jawbone comes with 4 removable clips, a large and small one for each ear, and are inserted into the earpiece. Within 3 months or so, my preferred ear-clip broke off inside the earpiece. Much of the reason was because I tend to carry my earpiece in my pants pocket when not in use, and these clips are just too flimsy (cheap aluminum or such) to withstand much in the way of bending. Aliph did send me a one-time replacement set, but they don't sell them and when it breaks again, I'm likely just SOL. So what's a guy to do? Wear it all the time? Yeah... not an option for me. Speaking of the earpiece.... the Jawbone comes with a set of hard-rubber tips in assorted shapes to accomodate one's preferences in fit. Unlike most other headsets, these ""twist"" on by slipping it on, then rotating it 90 degrees. In principle, it seems it'd be a good idea since others tips that normally slide on can sometimes slide off. In practice, these tips come back off a bit too easily. Another major issue with this headset is the end cap where the charging cable plugs into. The end of the cable that plugs into the Jawbone is this large cap with 4 pins in it. It fits very snugly over the rear end of the Jawbone... too snugly. After about 5 months of owning this headset, I developed a problem in that pulling the charger cap off would also pull off the cover on the Jawbone itself, exposing the internal components. Nothing seems actually broken. The cover just snaps back on and seems fine, but it shouldn't be pulling off like this with the charging cable. Honestly... this is just a slip-shod design. And speaking of the cable... I simply don't understand why so many companies still insist on using proprietary cable connections for an otherwise standard USB charging cable. If this thing connected with a standard mini-USB plug, it wouldn't have the problem I'm having. And the cable can be re-used for other purposes. These proprietary tips just add to more cable clutter. Aliph is going to repair the unit and I just received an RMA for it, but I'm done with this thing. Once returned, it's hitting the auction block. I would also like to comment on the buttons. The Jawbone has two buttons, each of which is ""hidden"" under the flexible plastic cover. While I like the sleek, buttonless appearance, in practice, pushing the buttons does require a bit more effort than other typical headsets. Not a deal-breaker in itself, but still a bit annoying. Overall, there's really very little I can say to recommend this headset. The flimsiness of the earclip alone should be of great concern to all but those who will either wear it full-time or plan to treat it with the gentlest of care. The sound quality doesn't live up to the hype. The proprietary charging cable pulls off the Jawbone's end-cap. The earpiece tips come off too easily. The buttons are a bit hard to press. The only positive thing about the Jawbone is its attractive appearance, but vanity isn't everything, especially for how lousy this thing is otherwise. I'm giving this a 1-star review because I just can't justify recommending this to anyone.",accessories,negative,neutral

"I was very excited a couple of months ago to finally be able to get out of my Nextel contract that my wife and I had. I decided I wanted a smartphone, I had my eyes originally set on Cingular and the BB 8700. But with Amazon you cannot port your number and that was a big deciding factor. I chose to go with Verizon and with the Q. I just wanted a phone that could sync with my work Outlook calendar, was not looking to use email. I found out that the Q would do that. After a couple of months having it, it is a decent phone. Signal strength is pretty good. I just moved and my old house I could only get 1 or 2 bars (my wife's E815 had full signal) but my new house I am getting full strength. I especially enjoy the Bluetooth for my headset while driving and the IR port for syncing my Outlook calendar from my work laptop which has an IR port. The screen is nice and crisp and the camera takes decent photos. I do agree with other posts about how it seems to take 5 ""clicks"" to get something done. Very annoying...I also do not enjoy the lack of home screen layouts. None of the layouts that are pre-loaded I enjoy. I do not know how to program in XML to get one the way I want to layout. One thing that does drive me crazy is the battery door. It is made of this cheap, flimsy plastic. You would think with a high quality phone like this it would have a better quality plastic or even possibly metal? The corners constantly pop out. So all and all, it is an alright phone. I can't beat the price that I got it for and it does want I want it to do. FYI- you do have to order the phone with the data package, but you can always CANCEL it when you get the phone set up.

"I got this phone based on a recommendation from AT&T :( silly me. I wanted a back up phone my wife could use in case her other phone failed to turn on (also a motorola different model almost 5x price). They recommend this phone because of it's low cost and it's a go phone so you only pay for minutes you use. I bought the phone and loved it. It was very low cost, came with airtime. It feels very solid, except for the battery cover which seems flimsy but seems to hold up with no problems. It had what I felt as good sound quality and a good number of features for such a low cost phone. I wanted to prep the battery since my wife was going to travel soon, so I left it powered on and would constantly press a button so the light would stay on and drain the battery. The display is amazingly bright, I could almost use it as a flashlight. I was also really surprised at the battery life. Anyhow after two cycles of draining the battery and then charging it to full, I figured it would be all set to use as an emergency phone for my wife who was going on a two week business trip. Wrong :( on the last day of her trip her main cell phone battery was low so she decided to try to use the back up phone. It wouldn't turn on :( I don't know if it was due to the xray machines at the airports or what but the battery was drained. She said she never turned it on at all until that day so maybe it got turned on accidently in her purse (phone turns on by pressing a button on the front for 4 or 5 seconds). Anyhow to make matters worse the AT&T rep also said I could also use it as a main phone by transfering the SIM. Nope didn't work either, I was on the older AT&T plan so I had to be migrated. Atleast the phone didn't cost too much. I figure I can still keep it as an emergency 911 phone too (Go phone minutes expire :( which the AT&T rep didn't tell me about).

I understand the the cell phone is a little big compared to the other cell phones but think about with how many cell phones can you take a picture quality as good as the Nokia 3650?

"I ""upgraded"" from a Tungsten T3 and am still not sure if I can handle the much smaller screen, tiny RAM cache, and missing buttons. I too have suffered several spontaneous reboots in the past 6 days of ownership. Many of these (and the reliability complaints in other reviews) can probably be attributed to the drastic changes made to the memory configuration. The 650 basically has an internal memory card that provides most of it's main memory. This is great for nonvolatility (such as when changing batteries), but bad for slowness and incompatibility problems for many existing programs. To help with the slowness, there is a small amount (10 MB) of real RAM, but that isn't enough for many applications such as games and those that use a lot of data. Incidentally, the Tungsten T5 has been panned for the same problem. I bought a 1GB SD card, so I was able to install all the applications from my old PDA; I just couldn't get some of them to run. This all manifests itself in OS crashes. You know it's happened when the device inexplicably starts rebooting itself. I'm curious why a company so obsessed with backward compatibility made a change that breaks so many programs (such as StreetFinder), and who responds with the comment that we should contact each program's manufacturer to see if they'll rewrite their software just to work with the 650. Sheesh! That being said, my main complaint is that that the Treo's Bluetooth stack is very minimal at best. It only supports the hands-free profile. Even though the documentation says ""headset"" in many places, it doesn't truly support headsets for MP3s, Audible books, and the like. This fact is buried on page 69 of the manual: ""Please note, however, that you cannot use a headset with Bluetooth wireless technology to listen to MP3 files"". After downloading the Bluetooth car kit patch, I am able to use the phone hands-free in my car, but I'm curious why a brand new device needed a patch already for a fairly mature/stable technology. My last big complaint is that they took away so many of the usability features that I'd gotten used-to on my last Palm. They took away many of the hardware buttons, which make many of the classic games now unplayable. With the T3, I had 5 buttons that I could customize, Now there are only 3 and one of those is really needed for the phone, so there are really only 2 available. They also took away the wake-up functionality of the buttons; you now have to press the power-on button, wait for the device to wake up, and then press one of the buttons. Maybe a future patch will enable each of the keyboard keys to be a button. And they took away the always-present toolbar. This was probably due to optimizations with the smaller screen, but I'd like to be able to make the choice. With the loss of the toolbar, you lose the drop down list of past applications and only have sporadic access to the clock, a Bluetooth control icon, and a few other icons. The bottom line is that many, many concessions were made to the PDA functionality in order to cram the phone features in. If having everything in one device is very important to you, then this probably isn't a bad choice. But if you consider yourself a PDA power-user, you're probably better off going with a real PDA and a real phone. If you're mostly interested in games and such, the N-Gage or Zodiac devices would probably meet your needs better. The N-Gage even has a phone.",connectivity,neutral,neutral

You have to charge it every day and if you are using a blutooth headset, you have to charge it every two hours. Now listen to this. I slid the phone up and started dialing, and the screen broke. I was extremely disappointed because for the amount of money i spent on the phone I did not expect the screen to break. I made the made the mistake of calling t-mobile which were very rude and said that since the screen cracks it is physical damage. Thank god the phone was under the manufacturer warranty samsung realized the problem with this model and I sent it in a couple days ago. I would not consider this phone to anyone all it is, is a huge headache that you have to recharge.",battery,negative,negative

"I have long hair and the rubber on the ear hook, gets tangled in my hair and rips my hair out, everytime I take it off. It also is quite large, around the back of the ear, and pushes my ear out. I find it uncomfortable. I have used this for probably 3 years but never have liked it. too frugal to spend on another one, till this week. It powers off, and or loses the bluetooth connection in the middle of conversations, quite frequently. I replaced this week with the Plantronics 925. So far, the 925 has been hassle with the hair and working fine. It does seen to have a shorter distance though before I lose reception if I have walked away from my phone.",connectivity,neutral,neutral
"***last update! alright, I have since removed this cover from my phone and thrown it somewhere... I just started having more issues with pressing the right numbers/keys with this cover on. Also started noticing the sun glare a lot more which didn't let me see the screen when I needed to. As soon as I took this off, it was like,,ahhhh, so much better. The touch screen was sooo much easier to handle and easier to see. In conclusion, I don't recommend this screen protector, looks good from here but causes you to lose functionality of your phone. Instead, I bought a new case for my phone with small wallet fnx (look at my reviews) and I'm happy just with that. ****Update from initial review: Ok, after using this cover for a while I have to downgrade my review. If it would let me change the initial rating I would change it to a two star. I have found that this cover does make it really difficult to see the screen of your phone when you're outside and if the sun is out, forget about it. It also does show all fingerprints or smudges so the phone constantly looks dirty or greasy. yuck. I've had some issues with the interface for the touch screen where sometimes I feel the cover gets in the way, but, it hasn't been too bad. Oh, and it has scratched a bit. In sum, I wouldn't get this case again. If you have the money to spare and want to try a new look for your phone for a little bit, then by all means. Otherwise, I would look for another option. *** I just received this item from Lux Case (seller). I got it for my new instinct phone and it seems pretty cool so far. The screen does look like a mirror when the phone is not active and when it is active it's see through and I haven't felt any interference with the touch screen features. I followed the instructions on the back of the package to apply it. They don't tell you to remove the oval little cut out that is made for the speaker at the top of the phone. I didn't remove it until after it was on the screen which was ok but I recommend punching this cut out 'out' before application (you'll know what I mean if you have an instinct and get this). Anyways, after I removed the first adhesive on one side of the mirror, I lightly situated the mirror in the right position over the screen. Then I used the ""soft card"" that came with it to smooth it out in order to get rid of any potential bubbling. Note that you should use this soft card to smooth it out and secure the mirror over the 2nd adhesive side of the mirror. Then after smoothing should you remove the 2nd adhesive as it tells you to do. It really took me only 1 minute to do this I'm just trying to be as helpful as possible because I couldn't find any reviews online for this product before I purchased it. Anyway, looks good, no bubbling. Not sure if it scratches easily because like I said, I just got it. will update if needed.",build_quality,negative,neutral

"This little charger works really well, but I do not recommend storing it with the phone's cord plugged in. When the metal on my phone cord's charging end makes contact with the metal border around the charger, it will spark and short the whole thing out. From there, the only way to get the charger working again is to plug it back into the micro-USB charger, which resets everything. Not a huge deal, but the sparks are concerning, and I don't know why the charger even needs that metal border in the first place. It seems aesthetic, and dangerous. I have since stopped storing the charger with a phone cord plugged into it, and only plug the cord in when I am ready to charge my phone. Otherwise, the product is great. I can usually boost my phone 2 or 3 times, which is great when it gets heavy use throughout the day. It does not take long to charge from low to full either.",audio,neutral,neutral
"I bought this bluetooth headset a month back for my v710 cellphone. It came along with a belt clip case. There was too much noise in the headset. Everyone I called were saying they couldn't hear me and it sounds like I 'm speaking far from a speakphone. I had to shout a lot. The earpiece(that goes around the ear)loosens easily as u use it. And I lost the earpiece in a week because I put the headset in the belt clipcase and it fell down sometime when i was walking ,bending down. The customer service was good. They send me a pair of spare earpieces. I thought i will try one more time with the belt clip case. But the next day i lost the entire set somewhere .It fell down from the belt clip somewhere again. Overall the headset doesnt work fine and don't use the carry belt clip. Hope this review helps.",accessories,negative,negative

"All the hype ended with a worthless, clunky piece of useless plastic. Every button became non-responsive and useless. I have never been more compelled to share my experience in hopes that anyone looking at this phone will feel informed. I would guess many earlier reviews that shed such a positive light would change after some time of use by the consumers. My phone stopped working without any reason. Tmobile customer service told me that a list of about 20 problems relating to the phone continue to increase. In my case, after exhausting the list of tricks to fix it, the representative pleasantly informed me that the phone was broken and beyond fixing. This happened to occur 15 days after the year warranty expired. BUYER BEWARE! PROBLEMS and NUANCES: 1. Very cumbersome. Using the stylus and inputing data while talking is nearly impossible unless you feel important enough to wear an earpiece. The ""buttons"" on the screen are too close together. You will never use the backspace feature more than with this device. 2. Sound quality is horrible. I found myself pressing the phone so tight to my ear in order to hear. In the process, every other button becomes activated resulting in hang ups, dialing, redialing, activating email, etc. 3. Internet connection was so slow. By the time you retrieved an email, you could set up a lemonade stand, spend the summer making 10 cents a cup, purchase a desktop, hook up an email connection and still beat the time to retrieve an email on the device. Horrible. 4. Camera less than desirable. 5. Bulky 6. Stylus loosens, falls out, gets lost, all of which make it impossible to use the touch screen unless you have twigs for fingers or fingernails shaped to a tip. Currently I am using a 9.99 loner phone that has already made calling, answering, and checking voicemail 100x easier. Bigger, more expensive, and fancy DOES NOT always equate to being a better product. When Tmobile customer service reps and local store employees told me they think the phone is a horrible product and they do not recommend them to customers, the message is loud and clear. Avoid the frustration of spending alot for very little.",connectivity,negative,negative
"I've only had the IMP500 a few weeks but am very pleased with the results thus far. So far I've only used the charger for 2 iPhone 4's and 1 iPhone 3G. I recently purchased an iPad 2 which is partially the reason I purchased the IMP500 to begin with. I have found I can get 3 full charge cycles for the iPhone 4 before the IMP500 runs out which is quite impressive. As I indicated above, I only just recently purchased the iPad 2 so I have not yet tested to see how many cycles I can get from the IMP500 but plan on testing it out this weekend. I purchased the IMP500 with plans to use it only on trips but I do find myself using it more frequently than expected..especially when I am not near an outlet. Overall I am extremely satisfied with the product when it comes to charging my iPhones. I am hopeful that the IMP500 will be sufficient enough to charge the iPad 2 as well. The only comment/suggestion I would add is that it would have been nice to have included an adapter for Apple devices so the existing cord that charges the IMP500 could be used. It's not a huge deal but being able to pack just the adapters without the need for the extra cable would be a nice feature. UPDATE: The IMP500 does not work with the iPad 2 so I am dropping to 4 stars. I know that device isn't listed in their description but they have other products at same capacity and same output so not sure why the IMP500 wouldn't work. Still a great product for the devices listed. UPDATE #2: Apparently there is an adapter that allows for the use of the IMP500 with the iPad. They are shipping me the adapter so I will update again once I confirm that it will work. So far I must say that idealpoint's Customer Service is top notch and that alone has earned the 5th star back. They have addressed my concerns in a timely fashion and I have faith that the adapter will resolve the issue. I would definitely recommend buying from idealpoint as they stand by their products and will work to make it right if someone is dissatisfied.",accessories,positive,positive
"The phone operates ok in terms of signal and battery. But, the menu system is completely outdated and non-user friendly (like all MOT phones). Do their software engineers even look at NOK phones to compare at all before they launch a new handset? They are light years behind in the interface. You still can't store several numbers for one person under one name (each has to be a seperate entry). The phone's green call button is on the right (should be on let like every other phone). The most annoying thing are the buttons on the side that constantly get pushed in your pocket and change the ring style and volume. Each time they change, it makes a loud beep. This phone is not worth getting, especially now (I had mine for a year and am looking for a better phone now as a replacement). MOT phones in general are to be avoided.",price,negative,negative
"Whether one blames it on the design of the Centro itself or on the battery, the length of time a Centro can run on this battery is too short. After a few months of use a Centro battery will barely sustain the device for a 12-hr. day even if no calls are made (and that's without Bluetooth's being active, which makes things worse). The time between charges can be improved by disconnecting the phone from the mobile service provider when you don't need it, provided you don't need it to be active for incoming calls, and de-activating Bluetooth when not needed. I don't know that there's much that can be done about this with current (pun intended, sort of) technology. Batteries are charged (there I go again) with providing more and longer power as each processor runs faster and a single device serves as a PIM/PDA, telephone, camera, MP3 player, data repository, and auxiliary brain for its user, at the same time as those very same marvels get even lighter & more compact, leaving little room for the battery, which occupies a significant portion of the device. The battery slips easily into the Centro or a separate charger. I highly recommend buying a spare battery with charger--that combination is available--especially if you plan to use the phone for playing MP3s too. The good news about the battery's being small, which of course is why it doesn't last long throughout the day, is that you can stick a spare in your wallet, pocket, or purse without much bother. A car charger is also helpful to give your heavily utilized Centro a second wind during the day. If you plan to travel with it--and that's obviously when the device is at its most helpful, carry along enough charged-up spares to get you between home and hotel power outlets. Under travel conditions you may want to have at least one charger for every two batteries; the chargers fortunately aren't much bigger than the battery, except for the cord.",performance,neutral,neutral

"my first gps (Mio 310) was stolen, so i decided to take a look at TomTom 920 (has european maps) and Garmin nuvii 650(good reviews)...

When i took Mio310 out of the box, i thought it is too small(especially after TomTom's 4 in screen), but after using Mio310 for a day, I am sure i don't need a huge screen(""small TV"") with just roads on my windshield window; in addition huge screen makes TomTom920 and Garmin Nuvii bulky and in NYC you better take it out of the car. Mio 610 pros: -very neat and cute design -size -packaging: wrist strap with stylus, neck strap, windshield mount, car charger, wall charger, earphones with volume and play control -user interfase and very intuitive menues -well organized POI, nice POI listing - with addresses, so you don't need to click on every one to find out where it is located -Canadian Maps -price; (TomTom has a big selection of voices, languages, car images, map colors and many other things(built-in and downloadable, free and not free); i think that many of them i will never use, for example I need just one pleasant voice and one good map color choice) -love its 3D map, easy North-up, Route-up and North-up plane-view switch, smartZoom -can be used just as an mp3 player -nice WorldMate travel kit -many other features that i yet need to explore and don't need to pay for Cons: - i am not sure where i can buy Eropean Maps Hope it helps.

"Let me begin by noting that I don't have much to say to those who griped about the lack of slots for credit cards and ID because that feature was never advertised for the Nero. What is the Nero, then? Only the best genuine leather case for the Note 2 on the market when you consider the price. The design and stitching seem to be first-rate (of course, time will tell), and did I mention the incredible price? So here is my review: Cons: 1) No cutout for the notifications LED -- I've noticed a lot of leather cases lack this feature, so I am assuming the lack of this cutout is due to the LED being so close to where the stitching runs for the case, whether it be a vertical or horizontal flip. 2) Lack of color options -- The Nero would look so good in brown or coffee (hint, hint, Boxwave). Pros: 1) I hate to repeat myself, but the price -- I could purchase five Neros for the price of one genuine leather Zenus. That translates into GAME OVER for me. 2) Cutout for mini-USB port -- a lot of leather cases that flip (vertically) don't include this, which means you need to take the phone out of the case to charge it. No need with the Nero, just plug it in. 3) Vertical flip design -- My first case was the Samsung OEM horizontal flip case, and I didn't enjoy talking with the case closed because it seemed to muffle sound. That meant I had to keep the flap open, which was annoying as could be and hindered holding the phone comfortably. With the Nero, however, I can do one of two things; I can either let the front flap hang down where it doesn't interfere with my holding of the Note 2, or I can fold the flap up behind the back. The two leather ""hinges"" on the bottom of the phone are very soft and flexible for doing this. 4) All corners covered -- While the Nero will never be confused for a protective case, the four corners of the phone are safely covered by the rigid grips that hold the phone within the case. I know one reviewer mentioned the phone falling out of the case, but that has never happened to me. Right now I am holding the phone upside down by only the leather back of the case and the phone is safely ensconced in the leather. 5) Screen protection -- The interior of the Nero is a soft, suede-like material that is very easy on the phone's body and screen, keeping it in beautiful condition. 6) Minimal design -- Let's face it, the Note 2 is a freakin' big phone. I like the fact that this case is form fitting and doesn't add much in the way of size. 7) Genuine leather -- no smelly, obviously synthetic PU leather here, folks. For the umpteenth time, let me emphasize the price of the Nero in comparison to countless other genuine leather cases. For what I paid and being that it is genuine leather, the Boxwave Nero provides incredible bang for the buck.",audio,positive,positive

"Pros: 1. Great music sound 2. Easy button control 3. Easy pairing process 4. I purchased mine at $39.99 for this price the quality and craftsmanship is worth trying to work out the bugs. Cons: 1.

Motorola has a good return and replace policy in the event you run into issues during the first year. 3.

"I purchased the Latte Bluetooth Headset to replace my old Jabra BT135 (w/c came free with my phone). I was receiving static problems and would lose connectivity with my old headset even if my phone was just in my pocket. I had thought that the issue was with the Jabra BT135 since I figured it was cheap and free and not meant to last very long. Also, the earhook of my Jabra was starting to break off so it was the perfect excuse to buy a new headset. The Latte Mocha Bluetooth Headset did not correct the issue. I experienced the same problems with static and lose of connectivity. I discovered that the problem was with my phone (SE W580i) which had poor bluetooth capability. And so, I got another phone which seems to have remedied both the Jabra BT135 and the Latte Mocha connectivity issues. I am quite disappointed though with the Latte Mocha since I expected (and wanted) it to perform much better than the Jabra BT135 (which looks like a free piece of plastic). The only thing that the Latte Mocha had going for itself when compared against my free headset was the fact that it was smaller and looked better. Unfortunately, when it came down to performance, the Latter Mocha fell short of expectations that were not very high to begin with considering that I was comparing it against an old headset that I got absolutely free. Here is my comparison: 1. Look - The Latte Mocha takes this category hands down. 2. Feel - The rectangular shape of the Latte Mocha is a nuisance since the corner eats into your ear and starts hurting if you have it on for more than 5 minutes. The Jabra had a better fit and was more comfortable as well. For the Latte Mocha to stay in your ear, you have to make several adjustments. 3. Pairing - equal performance. Simply turn the Latte Mocha on, have your phone bluetooth detect on. Enter the code and you're connected. 4. Signal Strength - both devices performed almost equally. Although the Latte Mocha did have a bit of a better signal, it wasn't much of a difference since distance wise, or with an obstruction such as a sliding glass door between the phone and headset would still produce static from just 5-7 feet away. 5. Sound Quality - Now here's where my biggest problem lies. My old bluetooth headset kills the Latte Mocha in this category. Voice on the Latte Mocha sounds high-pitched and muffled. Although there is clarity in the signal, and the volume is adequate, sound quality is poor compared to my old bluetooth. It's like listening in to an old transistor radio with really bad speakers. Although the signal is clear, you can't quite make out what the other person is saying because the sound is too flat. Another issue I have with the Latte Mocha is that when you answer a call, you have to wait 1-2 seconds before speaking or until you hear a short beep. It's like there is a connection delay which reminds me of 2-way radio. This only happens during initial connection but the rest of the conversation goes smoothly for the most part. I never had that problem with my old headset. One thing the Latte Mocha had going for itself (which is why I decided to keep it) in this category was the background noise filter. In an outdoor setting with slight wind, it would be impossible for me to use my old headset. The Latte Mocha makes outdoor calling slightly more tolerable though I wouldn't say the quality is great either. 6. Battery Life - The Latte Mocha battery life is fairly decent though not spectacular. I use my bluetooth headset constantly throughout the day. I still keep my old Jabra around as backup since the Latte Mocha, on a full charge, will only last me about a day and a half before the battery runs out on me (average of 2 hrs talk time throughout the day while on standby the rest of the time). When doing a comparison, I found the Jabra battery life to be slightly better since I could get at least 2 days out of it without worrying that the device will go dead. In conclusion, I would say that the performance of the Latte Mocha was ""Just OK."" Considering that I only paid 35 bucks for it, a fair deal it is despite the disappointing performance. I have tried several bluetooth headsets in the past but have yet to find a mid-cost model with the perfect balance of look, feel and sound quality. I think the best bluetooth headset I have used to date is the Plantronics Voyager 510. But since I don't want to look like a lost extra from the set of Star Trek, the Latte Mocha will have to do for now.",connectivity,neutral,neutral

"This meter is intended to detect electric and magnetic fields and microwaves. Solid red on the dial indicates where effects on the human body are supposed to begin. I have discovered a lot of these.

I don't know what a hybrid would be like if a regular gas engine car is this bad. I got it partly to check on emission from nearby hilltop radio towers. I did not detect much from the towers' direction when nearby them, but did get the red zone from another direction. Maybe something was being directed toward them from another source. The sensitive magnetic setting can pick up a battery powered watch ticking, when held right on it.

Pros: *Light weight. *Good internet speed. *More Affordable than Iphone *Looks very nice *Can fit in my jeans pocket if I want *Touchscreen is great Cons: *Callers complained that the conversation would drop in and out even when stationary *Battery life is horrible.

"As I renewed my contract with T-Mobile about 2 month ago, I decided to go with the Nokia 6133. Finally a nice flip phone from the Scandinavian company. Coming from Europe, I am very familiar with Nokia products, due to the fact, that Nokia is much more popular overseas than here in the US. But beside all my good experience with other Nokia phones (I owned about 5 over the last years), I have to say, that this is one of the weakest Nokia phones so far, for a few reasons: 1. Battery life. If you do not want to recharge your phone every 1 or 2 days (at medium / low level use), stay away from it. 2. Internal memory. More or less not existing. So forget about taking pictures 3. Reception. At best on a medium level. Especially indoors the reception is more than poor. Overall, the phone looks nice, but doesn't live up to Nokia's standard (which I am used to). I have decided to go with a Sony Ericsson instead.",connectivity,negative,neutral
"I wouldn't say this phone is a bad investment - my old cellphone was the C332 from the same maker and the RAZR is definitely several steps up. In general, this is what you should know on the basic level of the V3: 1. Camera can be good if you set it up every time you use it. The default camera setting takes light in at bad angles and makes the picture look really strange. I've setup the camera to underexpose by -1 (go to camera setup menu to do this), and upped the brightness to the second to highest level during usage (camera goes back to normal brightness when you don't use it so you'll have to adjust the brightness again everytime). Quality is most optimal for the V3 this way. Not great like a digital camera, but best for the phone's usage. Video application is a joke. Personally, I'd throw it out if I could in favor of more memory. 2. MP3 player - plays clips but V3 essentially does not have it. No extra memory slot to help you out either. Consider carefully - big music fans (like me) will not like the V3. 3. Handsfree Interface - I'm talking about Bluetooth and Speakerphone here. The phone beeps and flashes a blue light to show Bluetooth is in use, which can be distracting when you want the phone out of sight and mind. V3 also drops Bluetooth occasionally, the technology in the V3 for this is somewhat premature and not all the kinks have been worked out like later Bluetooth phones. *** Speakerphone is fantastic ***! Loud, clear, and will beat your expectations. Earbud that comes with RAZR is also good quality stereo. 4. Office features - Datebook, Alarms, Calculator, Shortcuts Setup, Voice Recorder, Instant Messaging. For such an expensive phone, it's got no currency converter. If you work with foreign currencies - skip the bells and whistles of this phone for something more practical. My biggest quip is for the Datebook - an antiquated software that will not let you edit entries once you've entered it into the calendar. The genius designers of the RAZR decided to skimp on this function because they're not making enough profits already. So once you've entered an appointment date on the calendar, that's it! No more rescheduling can be done! Even my old C332 had a powerfully better datebook than the V3. Voice recorder is very useful - I forget little things like where I park, email passwords, etc. and this feature comes in very handy. I love the shortcuts setup function! Don't have to navigate the menu looking for what I want but can just punch in some numbers after pressing the menu button. Very easy to setup and use. Alarm and calculator functions are just like any other phone. Not great but for figuring out a waiter's tip and alerting you when the parking meter needs change - you'll find it alright. I don't care much for instant messages because the iTAP entry method is too painstakingly long and I'm impatient. Does the RAZR meet the requirements of a phone? Yes. Depending on the service provider in your area, you'll have varying drop calls or not but more than likely no. I've had one call dropped in over a month and only because my friend has been using a cellphone with a non-local number. Other than that, I've been getting very good service. Volume on the receiving end is phenomenal, I've been told, but you'll have to setup the phone on your end by pressing the volume key during a phone call to change it. Call volume WILL NOT CHANGE unless you are on a call. Navigation menu is different for every phone and you'll have to learn it - but you can just setup shortcuts to simplify your life. I love the voice commands function! It does work well but still has some problems because this kind of feature is relatively new for cellphones and needs to have some kinks worked out. Lastly, the battery life is truly amazing on this phone! I get a week's use out of it easy. I charge on Sunday, and Friday night, I've only lost one battery mark. I can go on all week without worrying, even if I use Bluetooth and the internet. Most of all, you will like the feel of the phone - it has a tight sound when it closes. The phone is lightweight and it's length does allow you to talk into it instead of just into surrounding air. The keypads are somewhat noisy when you press it. The reviewer below is right - the user interface is on delay mode and the phone reacts to your entries like an old man about to go senile. The phone feels very comfortable in the hands and its unique design continues to make it stand out. The RAZR is more about form than function. It does fit my needs to some degree (again, the Datebook is a quack). I'm somewhat vain myself, which is why I bought the phone - because of its looks and how well recognized it is. I wanted an EVDO phone but that service won't be coming to my city for several more years. In the meantime, I have no regrets for buying the RAZR and if you can get this phone for free or with a few extra perks (I got a free Bluetooth and minimal service contract), I would recommend the purchase. On the other hand, if some features are critical to you (MP3, Datebook, etc.) then seek a different phone. Thanks for reading. :-)",camera,neutral,positive

"I owned the V300 and found it to be a bit quirky, strange things would happen when ever I charged it, when it was finished all the personal settings would revert back to factory standard.

I've only had it for 1 week and so far so good I always enjoyed functions such as speaker phone, voice dialing and voice memos, now I get the blue tooth and a much better redesigned key pad along with video clip capabilities. All of this is good news! If I had to pick a down side I would have to say that I'm dissapointed that Motorola decided to make this phone look exactly like the v300.

Typically when you holster a phone, there is a magnet that puts the phone into the ""holstered"" mode, no such thing here - #4.

"I got this device a little more than 2 years ago. I use it moderately, on avg. twice a week or so and usually not for prolonged periods. I keep it in the car when I am not using it. The device technically speaking still works and is functional, however, the rubber piece has completely worn off on one side and the receiver is now so loose it's virtually useless to wear it. It's as good as dead. There are a few more things to be said about it: 1. It's not really windsmart. When there is a wind blowing through the windows, no one can hear anything on the other end. 2. The power on/off button is tiny and made of plastic and feels like a little needle when turning on/off the device. The other buttons, while don't feel as sharp, are also uncomfortable to press. 3. The device itself is comfortable to wear, but it is not superior to other similar bluetooth headsets. The bottom line, for its price, I am not as happy about it as I thought I'd be and now that it has become practically useless in my case, I don't think I will be getting another Plantronics headset.",connectivity,neutral,neutral
"Update two years later: The unit's red light always stays on now, and it doesn't amplify the signal any more. I don't know if that's because I upgraded to a Motorola Droid 2, or what. But I always get 2 to 3 bars at my desk now, so I don't really need it any more anyway. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Overall, I'm pleased with the zBoost YX300 zPersonal Cell Phone Signal Booster unit, which I purchased to help with signal strength in my home office. It makes a definite difference. Not huge, but big enough to meet my needs, and well worth the price. I work out of my home office, and use my cell phone (currently a Palm Centro on Verizon) at my desk regularly. Standing out on my sidewalk, I get three bars. In most of my house, I get 2 bars. For whatever reason, sitting at my desk I would occasionally get two bars, but usually only one and sometimes none. After adding the zBoost, I always get two bars at my desk, which is a critical difference. I had hoped that I would get 4 bars at my desk, but that didn't materialize. But I'll settle for always having at least two bars, because now my calls don't drop and my voice quality is good. I found the setup pretty straightforward, with the exception of the suction cups on the antenna end not sticking very well, even to a slick surface. I solved that problem with an adhesive cable tie base, attaching the antenna to it with a couple of plastic cable ties. Fortunately, the suction cups on the base unit stick to the glass just great. It is crucial to observe the distances specified in the instructions, which are pretty scanty, on the back of the box. My base unit is stuck to the window at approximately the same height as the antenna (about five feet up), and the two are ten feet apart, give or take a couple of inches, and have a clear line of sight between them. I sit midway between the two, i.e., five feet from each. Both base and antenna are vertically oriented, if that makes any difference. The idiot light on the base is always green. It is also crucial to connect the antenna cable to the base first, and only then plug in the power. The light will be red, and stay that way for ten or fifteen minutes while the unit acquires signal towers, etc. Once it turns green, you can accurately guage the results. So, just three stars, because I had hoped for more bars, but the ones I got have made a critical difference to me. I would recommend this device to anyone with similar needs - just keep your expectations modest.",build_quality,neutral,neutral

"As there are some other excellent reviews here, I am concentrating on what has not been written. Sound quality varies, depending on how you use the headphones. Basically, both comparisons with AM radio and HiFi Sound are more or less true. Here is why. I find the earphones of an excellent quality at low to middle sound levels, delivering sound better than my Koss Porta Pro and on par with Sennheiser PC-150. But this is only true, when the earphones are wired to the source. It is also loud, at 50% PB output level sound get unbearable. Good sensitivity and sound detail. Using the including Bluetooth dongle, quality slips to the level of FM radio. Using it with iPod, which does not offer that good output quality (at least no comparison to my Al PowerBook 1.5GHz), quality slips a bit further. This is partially due to limitation of the Bluetooth and the fact that sound is amplified twice (both in iPod and headset). Further gets worse :(. By connecting vie Bluetooth to the PowerBook, quality does goet to the level of the AM Radio, as Mac currently do not support A2DP Bluetooth profile for improved audio quality. It is really a no go for listening to music, and Skype quality drops to the level of a normal phone. To get it working, however, there is one thing to keep in mind. I guess, Macs do not support another feature of Bluetooth, multi-access. Since I am using headset as a phone headset as well, it is constanly connected to the mobile phone. It seems like macs do not like sharing headsets, so bluetooth on the mobile phone has to be switched off. Otherwise, no problem whatsoever. Dongle-phone (SONY Ericsson K750i) combination works perfect and is REALLY cool stuff. It switches sources, once you get a call and then switches back to the iPod. Basically, I am keeping the headset, as getting rid of the wires on the go is worth the sound quality penalty. For a good quality, 3.5 mm jack is the only option for some time to come, in my opinion. So, this is an awesome product, well designed, very well built. If it suffers some quality issues, it is actually due to the limitations of the technology, not the product. I had no problems with charging, as did some other users. Another batch maybe :p. Accordingly, 5 stars for the product, 1 star penalty for inperfect technology (Bluetooth and Mac), 4 Stars in total.

"Let me say off the bat that I had been REALLY looking forward to getting this phone. I saw a great deal on Amazon and ordered it. However, when I tried to activate the phone it was listed in Sprint's database as a stolen phone! Obviously I sent the phone back to Amazon (along with a curt note!) and then bought one directly from Sprint. I loved it from the moment I took it out of the box... very slim, sleek, and sexy. I spent many, many hours setting up the phone just how I wanted it, including pictures, ring tones, and display preferences. I should have waited until I'd made sure the phone worked. Within a few uses I knew there were problems. Major ones. Over the course of two days I had the phone shut itself off and reboot randomly four times, display the incorrect caller ID and use the wrong ringtone for contacts, have the ringtones sounds like music played on an underwater stereo, and have the picture display show up like an old TV set with bad ""rabbit ears"" (remember those fuzzy, squiggly lines that would appear all over the screen if it wasn't a good signal?). I called Sprint and told them what I was experiencing. They said they hadn't heard of those complaints but would be glad to exchange it for me FOR $55 SINCE I DIDN'T HAVE A REPAIR CONTRACT WITH THEM! After I pointed out how ludicrus that was - charging me to swap a phone that was defective to begin with - they sent me another one free of charge. I was much smarter with the second phone and didn't program anything until I made sure it was working. Guess what? It had the SAME problems. Now I knew it wasn't just a fluke that my old one acted up. I then went to the Net and did some research, and it turns out that many, many people are experiencing the same problems I was (and yet Sprint still says they aren't hearing of these issues, which I find hard to believe). I once again called Sprint and had them send me out a 3rd phone. There was a 2 week gap between ordering and receipt and while I was mad at first that I was stuck for a while with a defective phone, it turned out to be a good thing bacause it allowed me to receive a phone from a new ""lot"". My 3rd A900 hasn't rebooted and hasn't played the incorrect ringtones. I was able to get around the scrambled-looking picture ID's with a tip I'd read from others who had experienced the problem. It occurs on long-distance numbers and apparently putting the ""1"" before the area code confuses the phone; if you remove it then the phone (and picture) works fine. I've now had the new phone for two weeks and think I'll keep it. I had already invested over $100 in accessories before I found out my first one didn't work so I am very hesitant to switch to a new phone (although Sprint offered to swap it out for a different - less expensive! - phone ""at no charge""). I'm going to be downloading my own ringers on to it later today and hope that it doesn't mess up the good thing I've finally got going. In short, if I had to buy this phone again I wouldn't. It's obvious that there are still many bugs and problems with the software and no solutions on the horizon. It seems to be the luck of the draw whether you get a phone that works as it should.",connectivity,negative,negative
"What a cute device! It looks elegant and the noise reduction technology works very well. But, for its price and the obvious work that went into its design, it's a real shame it doesn't work better than it does. The biggest problem is that you have to have the voice pickup lightly touching your cheek. The design relies on your ear canal holding the ear bud, or the Jawbone flaps around and the voice quality goes to heck. There are three quite firm rubber pieces for the ear bud, but none of them work for me. And, of course, it is so small and light that you cannot tell if it is touching or not, until your listener complains. Working out that problem shows up plenty of issues. The sides are square and awkward to get a grip on to push the earpiece in a little further. Just to help, the sides are made of a shiny, fairly slippery, plastic. An indentation on each side to allow you to grip and push it better would make a huge difference. And the hang-up button is just where you naturally push, so even being very careful doesn't stop a large number of calls being dropped. The buttons themselves have no feel and there is no indication where they are. So, less than obvious to operate, especially as the indicator light is very close to a button, and is easy to cover with your finger. The electronics work well, when the fit is good. I'm overall disappointed with the quality of voice on Bluetooth connections, having tried several phones and earpieces. Even with the Jawbone, voice quality is much poorer than my old plugged-in Jabra. That's progress - my new phone only does Bluetooth!",price,negative,negative

"I've been using a black RAZR for 3 months and here are my thoughts: THE GOOD ======== - FREE!! with a T-Mobile 1-year family plan - Better reception than my previous, 3 yr-old Nokia handset (6610) - Can use the same phone when travelling in Europe, Asia. Just need to get a pre-paid SIM chip locally. - Can be charged from laptop using included USB cable. - It's BLACK. THE OK ====== - Passable voice quality. (Maybe it's just because it's GSM technology, and coverage is not fantastic in outside of cities.) - Slim profile, though a little heavier than my previous handset - Nice colors in screen. Great ringtone sounds. Though these are pretty standard nowadays. - Decent bluetooth range. Paired this with a Jabra BT800 headset and I can run into the coin laundry with my ear piece and still connect with the phone in the car outside. THE BAD ======= - Short battery life. 7 hours talk-time as advertised is a imaginary. Phone starts to beep after 2-3 hrs of talking. - Organizer (calendar, alarm, notes, contacts) doesn't sync correctly with Outlook. - Oily screens!! The inside and outside screens and the metallic keypad get oily fingerprints after every use (is it just my skin?!) Looks yucky and kinda destroys all the aesthetics. Tried wiping now and then but notice minor scratches start to accumulate. (My clothes are not always cotton and I don't usually carry eye glass cloth.) - Low camera resolution. Other new phones have close to twice that resolution. Pics always kinda dark. - Camera doesn't take video. - No MP3 or radio.
