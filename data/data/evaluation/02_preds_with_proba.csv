"If somebody thinks this phone to be top of the line in 2005, I won't be surprised, but if it's said in year of 2007, I can't help but laughing. Man, there are ton's of better phones out there now.

Well, at first I would like a phone to be a phone, a mp3 player, a gps and a pda...That would be a pda phone like Cingular 8525 or Treo 700. But I have to pay $150 for that comparing to what I am paid $125 here, that is a difference of $275 with which I can buy a mp3 player or a gps that can do a better job than a pda phone.

"I've had this phone for 3 months, after using mostly blackberrys and Samsung flip phones for the past 7 years. Samsung makes very good phones. Overall: I am generally happy with the phone. The battery life is good, and the Verizon network is the best I have experienced ever. The phone looks great, and has many functions. However, I have not explored everything on this phone yet. The basic web function is good. The screen is excellent. I love the voice recognition software - it is excellent and works well. The speakerphone function is okay - not great, but useable. I have dropped it a few times, without a problem thus far. It is thin and the weight is acceptable. Complaints: It is easy to drop and rather slippery due to its very smooth and glossy exterior. The keypad is mediocre; Blackberry still has the best keypad for emails or other text. With this keypad, I need to use my nails. If I had no nails, I would find it very challenging. The calendar & calculator functions could be better integrated. Bottom line: I was hoping to use this as a PDA/phone, and am finding it difficult at times.

"No one could understand what I was saying! This was a used headset, so perhaps something was wrong with just this unit. The reviews on the H700 were okay, but THIS particular one was useless. It also looked somewhat beat up when I received it. Right from the start people were saying that we had a bad connection. Most people said that they just couldn't understand me.

If you would like go ahead and return it to us however a restocking fee will be charged by BooksExpress610."" I then asked how much and was told ""We will not know how much the restocking fee is going to be until we see the product and the condition of it. It also depends on if you return the provided accessories with it (USB cable) restocking fee is between 5%-15%."" So, I shipped it back in the exact condition it was shipped to me in, with the USB cable, and, of course, they charged me the full 15%! I will avoid Books Express610 for anything in the future!

"This headset was purchased to replace TWO crappy jabra freespeaks. This is very small, but unlike the goldlatern bluetreks or the Jabra, does not hide its mass well; it all sits right outside your ear, and in completely inconspicuous. With my old bluetrek and even the jabra, my hair hid most of it, which for me is a plus, as I do not use Bluetooth headsets to impress people or get atttention; I don't want peoples attention and questions. Which is this headsets only drawback - it has this HUGE, BLUE ORB-LIKE LIGHT on it that takes up the whole front of the piece. YOU WILL ATTRACT ATTENTION with this headset on. It blinks in standby, it blinks when in operation, it blinks all the dang time. But, if you can get passed that, it does work pretty well. The sound is a little tinny, but pretty clear. And unlike all my other bluetooth headsets, the headset volume only operates the headset, and doesn't link to the phone volume - this means that you have more adjustability for volume level and loudness, which is good. The mic seems really good - no complaints from those on the other end, basically. And the battery life isn't TOO ugly at 5 hours.

In the last 3-4 months it has started doing a soft reset without any prompting. You pick the phone up and hit a button to make a call or check messages and it automatically goes into a soft reset. I can't find any rhyme or reason to it and neither can the sprint people. The lag on the touch screen can be horrendous sometimes but completely normal at other times. There does not seem to be any correlation in this problem with temperature, time, or action. My final complaint may be related to Sprint, rather than the phone, but weekly I will have someone tell me that they called or left a message which I never got (or received hours, sometimes DAYS later).

"I got my phone with Verizon's ""New every 2"" plan. I have over a year before I can ditch this phone and get something that is that is more useful. In the beginning I had to adjust to the touch pad and it took a few days. Now, it dials radomly. If I check my call log, it may dial the last call on the list. If I unlock the screen to check the time, it may radomly dial the last call (sent or received). Hearing voices, you're not crazy, those are the annoyed voices of the people you inadvertently called when you put the phone in your pocket/purse. Not to mention the frequent Web connections that I have yet to figure out but I guess I touched something somewhere. In order to disconnect you have to unlock the phone which conveniently locks after the call is dialed. I don't know how many minutes I have burned on the web while the phone was buried in my purse. If the phone gets too close to your face during a call you will be muted or on some random menu that you don't want. Then after about 8 months the touch screen will stop responding when you touch it, you have to touch it several times or start over. Or, better still, it will speed scroll and you will be unable to stop it with out opening and closing the phone. I enjoyed reading the reviews because I see that the majority of them are about the same problems I have had. Verizon charges too much for every downloadable feature and also the chargers and headphones needed to get full use of all the extra features. If you are a techy and can get around all of these problems, great.

"We bought this item about a year ago through Amazon. Having read the reviews, we installed the antenna inside the attic as high as it will go, and installed silvered insulation below it to isolate it from feedback that its own transmitter would produce. The RF cable supplied in the kit is 50 feet long, but although our house is 2 stories high there's no convenient way to run the cable to the first floor - so we couldn't locate the antenna 20 feet above the transmitter. Our house is located in a neighborhood that's notorious for poor cell reception. This booster increased the indicated signal on our cell phones from zero-to-1 bar up to 5 bars right next to the transmitter, but our joy was short-lived when we found that the performance of our phones wasn't increased all that much - the reception still isn't as clear as it is outside our neighborhead, and we still get too many dropped calls. The signal strength drops off rapidly elsewhere in the house; on average it's about 2 bars. We tried the e-mail tech support; the response was quick and accurate but it didn't make a silk purse of our sow's ear. They wanted a 20-foot separation between antenna and transmitter but that would require running exposed cable through a second-story room and that isn't an acceptable option for us. They also suggested using as short a cable as possible for maximum signal strength so we used a 25-foot cable but that hasn't had a noticeable effect. So the bottom line for us is that it does increase reception from almost-nonexistent to barely-there. It works, but is not worth $190 to us.",neutral,neutral,0.11717732591182499,0.5345242559903286,0.3482984180978464

"I originally bought this headset for my wife (her first BT headset) because she didn't like the look of my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Plantronics-Voyager-510-Bluetooth-Headset-with-Multipoint-Technology-Retail-Packaged/dp/B0009B0IX4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset with Multipoint Technology [Retail Packaged</a>]. She found the 330 painfully uncomfortable and decided to sacrifice style for comfort (quite a departure from her typical choices, particularly regarding footwear); thus she is now enjoying my 510 and I'm getting by with the 330. I don't find the 330 uncomfortable for the first few hours, but I never forget it's in my ear like I did with the 510. If you have very small ears, it's probably a bad choice. Here's a brief comparison between the two with my 5 point ratings: STYLE & DESIGN I greatly prefer the 330's single side button that makes it very easy adjust the volume. On the 510, I found the volume and power buttons behind the ear difficult to reach and easy to confuse - probably my biggest complaint with the 510. I prefer the look and size of the 330. It's more modern and discreet. However, it's not a fashion accessory and everyone looks like a dork with a flashing blue light next to their ear with any BT headset. I wish people would realize this and take these things off in public (especially in restaurants). I only use mine in the car or when at the computer so this is the least important criteria for me. COMFORT The 510 is the clear winner here for both me and my wife. Everyone's ear is different and I find the 330 less uncomfortable than my wife did. A few may find the 330 fits them better than the 510, but the 510 includes 3 ear pieces to provide a custom fit. PERFORMANCE This is the best reason to get the 510. I've used worse headsets than the 330, but none better than the 510. With the 330, I get static if the phone is on the other side of body from the headset. The 330's claimed 30' range - maybe at high altitude with no obstructions, no other radio interference with no solar flares and a full moon - real world, more like 10' with no obstructions. Noise canceling is far superior on the 510. People would never guess I was using a headset - usually they couldn't even tell when I was in my car. The 330 is about useless in a windy environment and picks up a lot of background noise. Both headsets seem to have very good battery life and audio quality for listening. The 510 also has the advantage of being able to pair with 2 devices simultaneously but I've never tried this feature. STYLE & DESIGN 330 - 4 510 - 2 COMFORT 330 - 3 510 - 5 PERFORMANCE 330 - 3 510 - 5 FEATURES & PRICE 330 - 4 (probably better than most headsets < $30) 510 - 5 (more expensive but worth it for features and performance) OVERALL 330 - 3 510 - 5 The comfort and performance of the 510 justify the extra $16.",neutral,positive,0.012894971415499858,0.35473835430775646,0.6323666742767436

I didn't find that the noise cancellation feature worked at all on the reception end. The killer for me is the battery life. I have had my Jawbone for just over a year, and the battery is toast. I charge it until the light turns white, and then it lasts about 30 seconds before giving a low battery warning. Since it is a sealed unit, there is no way to fix it. One final pet peave, the Jawbone lacks the simple features of a $30 Bluetooth headset. Both my Jabras allow me to redial my last number dialed by simply holding down the main button for a couple of seconds. If I try this with the Jawbone, it simply shuts off. The lack of easily accessible volume control is also annoying. Aliph sacrificed utility for style, a trade I don't think was worthwhile.",neutral,neutral,0.10782952151659204,0.8362211646606392,0.055949313822768625
"I bought a new RAV4 and wanted to keep the dogs out of the front seats before they messed them up. I first installed the barrier behind the back seats with the seats upright. It worked fine, but I realized the space might be a little small for our two medium-size dogs. The left vertical support also comes close to the seatbelt reel in the roof for the center passenger. The barrier installed fine, but the left support is a little uneven (no problem functionally). Based on comments by other reviewers, I also cut circles from an old gray sock and placed them above each of the rubber ""suction"" cups at the roof, to keep from marking the roof. To provide more space in the rear for the two dogs, I then folded the rear seats forward and installed the barrier on the back of the folded seats. This, too, worked well. Because the wire mesh barrier is only 18"" high and is fixed near the top of the vertical supports, this left an open space about 12"" high below the barrier. As luck would have it, I found a leftover piece of lightweight 1/8"" plywood (flooring material) which was 18"" high and 48"" wide, exactly the size I needed. I attached this to the bottom of the mesh barrier with two twist ties, which allows me to remove the barrier quickly (you can make out the twist ties in the photo, as well as the sock circles above the upper suction cups). A word about assembly. Lay out all the pieces first, and note that the two vertical extension tubes (parts list letter C) are packed up inside the vertical tubes on the main mesh panel...I thought at first they had been omitted. You'll need to shake to get them out. When assembling, keep the wire mesh facing you, both on the main panel and on the wing mesh panels. Orient the wing mesh panels with the ""vacant"" mesh portions at the top and bottom, as in the photo. The panel clamps must be installled inside these vacant sections. Pushing the panel clamps down over the tubes was the hardest part, but not a major effort. Install the hand nuts (parts list letter H) facing you, so that the vertical supports are at the far side of the barrier. The lower tube ""clamps"" (parts list letter I) are not clamps at all, they are two tapered plugs. Although not shown on the diagram, you insert one in the bottom of each of the vertical extension tubes (C). Then you install a hand nut (H) on each of the two foot ""bushings"" (which are threaded bolts with a rubber bumper on one end...letter E) and stick the threaded end of the foot bushing up into the tube ""clamps"". When installing the barrier, make sure the foot bushings are all the way up into the vertical upright tubes. Then, once you have the tubes extended against the roof as firmly as you can manage using the lower tube clamps (F), use the hand nuts on the bushings to extend the tubes even further, providing additional tension against the roof.

"Although ""argh"" serves as a perfect summation of my thoughts on this product, Amazon requires more than a one word statement before letting you post a review so I'll go ahead and share the entire story of my purchase on the off chance someone will read it and smirk. Back in the day I used to buy either the ""official"" component cables for game systems or Monster's products IN STORE at the time of the console's launch without batting an eyelash at the price. As the years went by I read all kinds of articles about how the only stand out quality of these supposedly superior cables was their profit margin, so I swore to never buy from the likes of Monster again and in fact laughed in the face of somebody who told me they ""had to"" spend hundreds of dollars on HDMI cables alone after purchasing an HDTV. My ""enlightened"" viewpoint was reinforced mostly by a string of successful purchases from BlueRigger (through Amazon, and though I didn't bother to rate any of their products at the time I'm tempted to go back and do so now because of the stark contrast between their products and this piece of junk), but alas even though I use their digital cables for everything from my PS3 to my PC they don't produce analog video cables, so after laughing at the $20-40 pricing of other Wii component cables I grabbed this one. Before I go on let me admit that I didn't actually read any of the reviews for this product before purchasing it. I had spent a lot of time researching my other purchases on the day I made this one, and I use a weird multi-system unbranded S-Video cable I bought from an import company that's now defunct with my Gamecube (and Sega Dreamcast...), so trusting in the discretion of the greater Amazon community I merely glanced at this item's 4+ star rating before grabbing it. If this admission causes you to write my opinion off then so be it since sitting here I can only mock my own indiscretion. As to why I'm so down on this product, in its mild defense it not only worked as flawlessly as a component cable can at first, mine still technically functions now. The worthless thing just doesn't transmit its red signal anymore, after a mere two days of use. In what I can now look back on as what I got for the ~$4 I spent on it, when the cable started malfunctioning my first thought was actually that I'd spontaneously gone colorblind, so the realization that it was just the cable's fault came as such a relief I burst into laughter at my all around folly. As to why I've bothered to write this review, my first thought upon realizing its failure was to exchange the cable, but after finally reading some of the reviews for this product I've decided not to waste any more time with it. To summarize this product and my overall experience with it I again return to ""argh,"" but if you're looking for some advice mine is to steer clear of this trash and just keep using the composite cable that comes with the Wii instead of spending $20-40 on one from Nintendo or Monster. I'm assuming that if you're even considering this item then you're not at liberty to drop that kind of money in the first place so I won't go into the old ""if money isn't an object"" spiel, but frankly even when this cable was working properly for me it's not like the difference between composite and component has much of an effect on one's experience with the Wii anyway.",negative,negative,0.970654687097813,0.005611608731420593,0.023733704170766465

"I've had this for about 10 months. I really wanted something that sounded better than my iPod earbuds, so I ended up purchasing a pair of DT880 600ohm headphones. Of course, these need an amp to sound their best. After reading all the hype on sites like head-fi, I decided that the Magni 2 was worth a shot. First, it was pretty inexpensive for the supposed quality. Second it is made in the USA (not required, but nice). And third, I figured that I could always sell it if I didn't like it. Pros: 1. The Magni 2 has a very nice sound, overall. 2. It drives my DT880 600ohm headphones without a problem. 3. The unit looks really nice (this is subjective). 4. It feels solid and is heavy for it's size. 5. It is not nearly as hot as some people claim, which was a nice surprise. Maybe this changes from unit to unit?? Cons: 1. The Magni 2 got pushed off the edge of a 17 inch tall ottoman onto a carpeted floor. Now it's dead. Won't power on... nothing. Seriously? It has never been dropped before, and has hardly been moved off my desk. I know it is not meant to be bumped around, but wow! In contrast, my girlfriend dropped my iPad and it tumbled down some stairs and it still works great. The Magni 2 feels solid, but apparently that is NOT an indication of durability. 2. It has a discernible level of hiss once I get past 12 o'clock on the volume control. If you are not sensitive to hiss, no big deal. But I hate noise and hiss. It was not a deal breaker, because most of the time I listen at low levels. But it was irritating if I wanted to turn it up. 3. The amp is a little ""bright."" Not a big problem, but it can get a little tiresome after listening for an hour. I think the Magni 2 is worth the price. If a little brightness and/or hiss doesn't bother you, it should serve you well. I would recommend being really careful with it! Without it breaking so easily, I would have rated it 3 or 4 stars. For the record, I do NOT expect Schiit to fix this for free under warranty. I understand that it was dropped. Now I am just waiting to hear back from Schiit about repair cost. It may not be worth fixing. We'll see! UPDATE 9-13-16: Schiit wanted $80 to fix it, so I declined. I think $80 is a fair price for the repair, but I only paid $119 for the amp so it just is not worth it.

"Overall, this phone functions OK. The reception is good, and voice quality (both ways) is good. However, this phone is only useful if you set all volume controls to maximum. Even then, the volume levels are just ""adequate"". It's more full-featured than any handset I've ever owned. Having THREE fully programmable alarm clocks is especially useful. I also like having multiple phone number fields for each ONE contact, though I don't understand why there are two ""mobile"" phone fields and only one ""home"" phone field. (the opposite would be more useful) Talk time is about two hours and ""standby"" is 3-4 days, in actual use. Both LCD displays are good quality, but it really needs a brightness control, as black shows up as light gray (brightness is too high and can't be adjusted). It does have a contrast control, but white level is fine, so the contrast control is kind of useless. The LCD displays themselves seem to be really high quality, so it is disappointing that they are improperly adjusted. (the image quality COULD be outstanding, if properly adjusted) I don't like that a whole section of the menu is devoted to ""Get It Now"", though Verizon probably insisted on those useless money wasters. (can't fault LG for that) Other than that, the menu system is pretty easy / less cluttered than some handsets I've used. The camera functions OK. The quality of pictures is terrible, but about the same as any other camera phone. If you want pictures, use a digital camera! I mainly like the camera portion of the phone for emergency use. For example, it is a good idea to carry a disposable camera in the car for car accidents. But if you have a camera phone, that's just as good. (emergency use) And if you are ONLY going to send photos to other camera phones, the photos will look good. Forget about using them outside the camera though, as they are low resolution and low quality (just like all camera phones) One nice thing about this camera is that it has a built-in flash (if you enable it), but it would only be good for really short distances, like 6 feet or less. One major gripe I have about this handset is that there is no external indication that the phone is actually ON. There is an LED by the antenna, but this only lights up during phone conversations. (WHY???) If the little LED was on all the time or blinking, it would not affect battery life at all (that you'd notice, anyway). You can set the backlight of the front LCD display to ""ALWAYS on"". That would give you an external indication that the phone was on. But if you did that, you'd have to charge the phone about twice a day. (!) My wife bought these phones (two of them) and we'll probably keep them. If I'd have known what I know now though, I'd have probably picked something different. The handset has buttons RIGHT where you hold it on BOTH sides of the phone, making it very difficult to hold. And if you are left-handed (I'm both), you simply can not hold this phone, as the buttons (which are ACTIVE during phone calls) are right under your thumb. What a stupid design. If there's going to be buttons on the side, it should be on the side of the flip-up part, NOT the part that you hold!!!",neutral,neutral,0.029953942053958505,0.9383977826484482,0.03164827529759332

"I dig the concept. I use the iGo system for all my mobile devices, and it's great for the most part. But inevitably, these particular plugs stop working for some reason, differentiating them from the other tips in the system. Some last longer than others, but I've replaced these a few times over the last few years. I use them in the car for my phone, mostly, so they get a fair bit of use - perhaps plugging and unplugging about once per day on average, and that's considerably more than, say, my iPod power tip. I'm a DIY type that insists on fixing things until they just refused to be fixed anymore, and even I can't bring these back when they poop out. It seems connectivity stops happening inside the unit, either because they bend slightly out of shape or short out. Sometimes the wiggle method keeps them somewhat functional for a little while, but then they deteriorate into only being functional when you prop them or hold them *just so* to keep the charge running - and that's a serious pain in the ascending colon to be futzing with while driving. There are tiny metal prongs on the inside of the plug that disappear or flatten out, and that seems to be the problem, but even getting in there with a tiny tool and reshaping them doesn't seem to help. Opening up a dead one didn't yield any insight either. They are cheap. That's a plus. And they are part of a neat system that minimizes all the peripheral pluggage. But I'm morally opposed to the continual replacement of cheap plastic and electronics and feeding the landfills with e-waste. Even though these are tiny, they contribute to that problem, so you may want to hold out on this particular type of mini-usb for the iGo unless you can differentiate between one that is made better and one that is not - which is something that I haven't been able to determine just yet. There do seem to be different model numbers for the same type of plug though, so more research is necessary.",neutral,neutral,0.10873505710754316,0.8503779351539579,0.04088700773849902

"The case seems well made, but the little things are either not thought through or not manufactured to spec. The fit overall is reasonably snug, but since the bezel on the Note is so thin, there is precious little non-screen real estate on the sides, and the case could have benefited from more stiffness in that area. As it is, it just bulges to the left and right. The bottom strip also bulges in the middle. The microphone on the Note is a small hole on the bottom of the casing; the case has a round piece punched out for it, but it's not quite centered on the hole. You have to wiggle the phone and/or stretch the leather from time to time to keep it open. On the other hand, the cutout around the USB/charger connector is huge (at least three times its width). There is no (I repeat, no) way to connect the earpiece or headphones to the top jack when the flap is closed. Apparently, designers did not expect Note owners to listen to music or the radio while the phone is in their pocket (or to have a long conversation hands-free). Nothing that 5 minutes with an X-acto won't fix, of course. Also (this concerns only the vendor, not the product), Prime members should not put their trust in the ""two-day shipping"".

"UPDATED Feb 9th 2008: Well the BT5020 is now dead, I'm sending it back to jabra and we will see from there what happens. Following my initial review I returned the unit for replacement once and that fixed some of the sound issues, not all of them but enough that I was acceptably pleased. Over the 6 months I found the unit to be functional and seldom did it offer me reason to complain, the sound was clear and I could be heard without many ever offering complaint, unless I was outdoors in a wind, but I think some aspects are to be understood and tolerated. I will note though, using the dual connection capability was nice, but glitchy, especially when hooked to a nextel and using direct connect, then things truly got fouled up and generally connections were lost to the phones and often calls. Over all I won't lower or raise my review on this unit, it worked when it worked and while far from stellar, I think for 30 bucks it was acceptable. ________________________________________________________________ I'm new to the BT ear piece market, this being my second in the past few months. My first was/is the Jabra BT500, which is very enjoyed... once I got used to tolerating the eargel discomfort, and no adjustability for fit. So my hopes were high with the BT5020, in getting rid of the eargels and allowing for some angle and length of speaker position, would fix my comfort levels. So my first impressions of the BT5020 was wow, this is comfortable, it weighs less, no eargel and the size is very balanced with the over all package. Turned on the power and it started in pair mode, and paired without a glitch or bump with my Sanyo 8400. So far so good, I was working in the yard, so decided to leave it on and see how I liked the fit and feel. And to speak straight, I forgot I had it on and got the sudden reminder of it real quick when my wife called, the vibrate alert went off (I'd forgotten it had vibrate alert) and I nearly came unglued tell I recalled what was doing it. This thing is that comfortable, no feeling like my ear is plugged up, no strange pulling or pushing, or slippage to keep telling me I have something on/in my ear. The phone call however set off the first warning signs, there was very distinct static and crackling, this with my phone on my hip on the same side as the earpiece. I kept it in mind but kept working for a few hours before deciding to go and really play with my new earpiece. I started conducting some tests around the house, called customer service of my phone company, and figured to kill two birds with one stone. I had the phone on a shelf at the same level as my ear, about 3 feet away. The static wasn't noticed this time so I began moving around the room and it returned. After 9-12 feet distance, the static was so bothersome that if the CSR had answered, I'd not have been able to conduct business. I tried moving it closer and at different angles with varying results and little improvement. Static wasn't noticed as a background noise or white noise type, but direct distortion of voice and or background music (I was on hold a while), it changed with the volume/beat of the sound I was supposed to be hearing clearly. To say the least, right now I'm not pleased; I truly like the feel, fit, weight and appearance of this headset. There is a notable creak from the flexible portion but nothing I will notice after a few days of using something. The button position for those used to the BT500, as I am, is a little different as it is a bit harder to tap the answer/end button, for you can't really just pinch the end of the mic area and catch the button, as you can with the BT500, but those are small things and a few days of playing will pan out if they become larger issues. I've worn wired headsets for years, mostly Plantronic or Jabra versions'; so moving to BT has been a learning experience. I'm not going to give up on the BT5020 just yet, I'm going to further test it over the weekend, at work where I'll have multiple other phones and radios on or around my person, at times talking on various radios of various frequencies. I think this will truly tell me if the BT5020 can hold mustard, or if it gets packed up on Monday and sent back, something I'm usually ill tolerant of doing unless something is truly truly broken and/or a turd.",neutral,neutral,0.07528765528691288,0.8962398006086406,0.02847254410444654

The belt clip is a sturdy and strong pinching type clip. It does not clip around a belt but it has not popped off of my belt yet.

Many of the reviews here are giving this low scores because it isn't working with a particular phone/computer/av device - which is unfair to the product. The issue is with the devices not the headphones. Even when a manufacturer puts all of the proper bluetooth protocols in a phone - often your wireless carrier disables them so as not to compete with other devices that they are hawking. I am using this with an LG VX8300 cell phone and it works perfectly in every sense. Hi-Fi audio automatically gets paused for answering an incoming phone call. Incoming and outgoing sound is crystal clear. It is a little heavy and has the silly blue lights on it - the weight was probably required to get 14hrs of play time on a charge though.,positive,positive,0.2047627523225664,0.15445511969732012,0.6407821279801135

"I'll be honest, I was a bit apprehensive at first about getting one of these things. Now I don't see how I ever went without it. I bought my sidekick two weeks ago today and I just love it. Yes, it is pricey but well worth it. Since I already had a contract with Verizon I only got the sidekick for data. I don't see what people are complaining about with this phone. Web browsing is what you'd expect. Pages load quicker on here than on my comp sometimes. But keep in my, it's a phone, not high speed dsl. I have used it as phone service a couple of times (just to test out coverage and reception in my area) and it's been great. A few deadspots in my house sometimes but still better than I expected. I live in the Richmond, VA area so T-mobile has excellent coverage here. Text messaging is soooo easy with my sidekick and AIM and AOL email are remarkably fast. It's the closest you can get to a mini-laptop on a phone. The only real complaints I have about this are minor to most but enough that drove me to give it only four stars: first, the camera. It's mediocre at best and sucky at worst. My camera on my LG vx-6000 is better. You have to get really close to the person or object you are taking a picture of in order for it to turn out decent. I need tips on how to work with the camera maybe. The other thing I hate is the lack of variety with the ringtones and games. There aren't nearly as many as Verizon has, but I'm hoping that this will improve. All in all, it's still worth the money. Verizon was robbing me blind with the amount of texting I was doing every month so I'm glad I have the sidekick for that. I am in the process of having my sidekick tricked out and I'm seriously contemplating having it studded (damn you Paris Hilton) because it's too cute looking and reflects my personality sooo much. I highly recommend buying a sidekick especially if you are an on the go person like me who does a lot of text messaging and emailing.",positive,positive,0.0031112752550816842,0.22132628390440182,0.7755624408405165

"Installation and setup of the wireless extender was as easy as purported. However, I'm having a hard time determining whether I'm actually getting any improvement in cell reception while in my home. Voice quality during calls is still only fair to poor with lots of garbling. And I still have instances where someone tries to call me and the call goes straight to voice mail without ever ringing my cellphone. I had hoped the extender would overcome some of the inadequacies of cellular technology, but that seems not to be the case. It's interesting how bimodal the reviews for this product are: folks either love it or hate it. Based on other reviews and my own experience, it would seem to be a good product in applications where there is a significant difference in the signal strength outside your home vs what you get inside. That is, if you get 4 bars outside and only 0 or 1 inside, then this may be worth a try. On the other hand, if you get a decent signal in your home and you're just trying to improve call quality (as was my case), then take a pass on these extenders.",neutral,neutral,0.23382196558358834,0.7285653789883959,0.037612655428015694

"This is my second bluetooth headset. I felt it was time to upgrade from my BT130 Jabra. I have a Motorola Rzr so I thought it would be great to pair it with a Motorola headset. I decided on the H700. I liked the design, the folding boom microphone, the fact I could use one charger for both phone and headset. The headset worked great for about a week with a couple of times losing connection...I did not think twice about it. No static, great, clear, quality sound. However, after one week of use my phone would detect, would pair, but was UNABLE TO CONNECT to the headset. I took it back to the store to exchange it for a different unit. The new unit paired and connected ok but there was noticable static when in use. I did not experience the static with my first unit. This inconstistency to the quality of this headset is a disappointment to me. I expected more from Motorola especially since they charge so much for their headsets. I am returning this headset and I will give Scala 500 a try. I will let you guys know what I think about it. So in summary the H700: 1) looks good 2) small, light, portable 3) the folding microphone boom is very convenient in turning set on/off 4) when it worked it worked GREAT 5) dissapointed with the inconstistency in quality. My suggestion: Do give it a try.

"I bought the Razr thinking it was awesome! Oh how I wish i would have looked into more! The phone is incredibly slow, to the point I am disconnecting calls left and right because I don't think the call even got answered because it takes so long to pop up. While texting, I usually have to wait 10-15 seconds to let it catch up to what I typed, then go back and fix the predictive text errors (but i guess thats with all phones?) The other day the phone started freaking out on me. It kept hitting the number 8, then star, then the ""text message menu button"", and it was so fast I couldn't use my phone for anything. Even when I took the battery out and back in, it still did it. Then it stopped. The next day it did it again. I am taking it back today because its a terrible phone.

"Again, stay away from this phone. I've made the mistake not to take into consideration the negative reviews that had previously been posted on this site (btw, it looks like I am the first to do a review for this phone; that's funny, I was here the day before and there were multiple other reviews for this V600) and went ahead and bought the phone. Major mistake. I got the phone Nov 22 and ever since I've been having only problems with it. I am returning it to Amazon for replacement with another phone. Not Motorola for sure. It loses the signal just out of the blue, and it won't come back to life for anywhere between 10-15 minutes and a couple of hours. If during this time I want to make a call I have to power it off and back on. I have 2 other lines with T-Mobile with different phones, and they all work in the same areas and conditions. It also appears that Cingular (another GSM carrier which had this phone) already pulled it off the market for reasons unknown to me.

"I have been using the parrot minikit for over a month now. As stated in other reviews the instruction manual is absolutely awful.

"Blackberry HS-655+ Bluetooth Headset (Black): For the final price of [...] this BT headset is a good value. Pros: Light-weight, fits good in my ear, sound quality is good, although voices sound a little muffled. Cons: Buttons are hard to press, can be charged only in the special case that comes with it, silly blue light that illuminates the main button. I find it very uncomfortable when I have to press and hold the main button to turn the 655+ on or to activate voice dialing because the strength required to operate the button pushes the headset into my ear canal. I am not a fan of headsets that flash silly blue light, while it may not be very noticeable during the day, it is very noticeable in the dark. 655+'s main button with the BB logo flashes blue light when it is on. I prefer Nokia's approach with a very small and discrete light. I see the necessity to use the charging case as another downside of 655+. Unless you have two charging cases or carry one with you all the time, you cannot charge head set at home and in the car. Bottom line. Given all the cons, at five dollars it is a good value, but I'd be disappointed if I paid more.",neutral,neutral,0.01435423224125611,0.9571901566028181,0.028455611155925837

"I will say that the most annoying part of a cell phone is the latency associated with navigating the menus, browsing the web, etc. My razr is so slow to go through menus, to cycle through contacts rapidly, browsing the web is a chore. I get so mad waiting for the phone to react even though it only takes a few extra seconds it will sometimes miss key strokes and is just painful to use when it is so delayed. The blackjack is not as bad as the razr and navigating the menus is pretty quick. There is occasional slow downs if memory is low and you try to do something that requires several menus to go by in rapid succession (for example ending a call and then quickly pulling up contacts to make a new call will take like 5 seconds). HOWEVER, web browsing on this clunker is very very slow. Even with 3G the latency is horrible. You can expect very slow responses when going through multiple pages/frames, etc. If you want to download large files, it goes very fast. If you want to browse the web as quickly as on a computer, the blackjack is no way going to make you happy and it is quite frustrating in the number of pages that have to be refreshed/reloaded in order to load since many times it hangs. Using the Gmail app to check my Inbox takes about 40 seconds from main screen to seeing new messages but the amount of data (3G or EDGE or GPRS) is very small, the phone just can't process the data fast enough and the network's latency (or the phone's networking latency) makes this a very slow process. This is due to the phone, not the 3G speeds. The phone just doesn't have the computing power to load web pages quickly and make browsing the web the same as on a computer with just a smaller screen. It also doesn't come with a flash player which makes many websites have problems. Also I live right in the middle of Philadelphia and sitting on my couch I go from having 3-4 bars of 3G to four bars of EDGE even though I haven't moved.

The phone is beautiful and thin, and although this phone has been available for a long time now, I still can't get over how thin it is.

Where my Samsung gets 1 bar to no service in my room where I am typing this from, the RAZR gets a steady 3 bars, sometimes 2 but it never goes below that.

"Only use this a couple of days before returning it. The call button is so stiff, it's next to impossible to press while the headset is in your ear.

"People have already discussed how nice the phone looks and how good the packaging is. What nobody seems to mention are some of the flaws. 1. Periodically the phone will pick up the line after the first ring by itself. This means that it will go off-hook and stay off hook, until I find it. Unfortunately this can be 3 hours or more. 2. The software to make VOIP calls disables the sound card so I have to keep switching it back and forth between my music and speakers and my Calisto VOIP calls. 3. The charger design seems like the contacts on the headset will get corroded from sweat and cease to work. Overall the phone looks nice and works well so far, but the auto answer really takes your phone out of commission until you realize it. 1/30/09 Update About 1 month ago I sent the phone back to Plantronics since the tech support thought it was defective. Well they know this is a piece of junk, since as soon as they hear the model of the phone they sujest a replacement immediately. Unfortunately this is not a game for me and I need to use this as a business phone as well as a Bluetooth for my cell and my Skype headset. Since Plantronics insists on playing games; they have already suggested that if the next one does not work they will send me another one. I can't give any less stars now, but do not consider wasting your money on this junk.",neutral,neutral,0.19951832282804838,0.7915533438609028,0.008928333311048973
"After doing extensive research on the best hands free device for my car I purchased the Motorola Roadster Pro. While the look and ease of operation is fine the quality of the voice recognition is poor. I also had several complaints of distorted speech from my callers. The hands free option to place outgoing calls must be synced with your phone but this feature proved a failure. The last irritant i have encountered is with incoming calls to either ""answer"" or ""ignore"". This feature only works sporadically and forces you to use the call answer button directly on the device.

"I purchased a new Sanyo PM 8200 in 10/04. I loved the phone at first. Then about 3-4 months later (January or February) I noticed the part where my phone flipped open was cracking. I immediately took it to the store to see if my warranty would cover this crack. The CSR said it would and they'd tried to fix it. I left my phone for 45 minutes. Upon return I was told that since there was a TINY crack near the antenna on my phone, that my warranty was void. It took me refocusing my eyes numerous times just to be able to see what they were referring to. So I left with no resolution. And very discouraged and upset. In May '05 my phone stopped charging. Again, I went to Sprint hoping that maybe this time they would value my years as a customer and help me out. Again, I was cast away with NO resolution. The CSR said she wasn't familiar with my problem,(even though I researched the problem on many websites and there were many users who had experienced this) but she'd have a tech look at my phone. After 45 minutes, they said nothing was wrong with my phone, even after I asked them to plug it into a charger and they themselves saw it wasn't charging. The CSR suggested a new battery. So I purchased a new battery, thinking that MAYBE my 7 month old battery had died. I was LIVID! I was even more upset when that didn't solve the problem. I went back to the store a few days later to return the $60 battery and to see if maybe someone ELSE would be a little more helpful and he was. His name was Clinton and he replaced my old phone charger with the bar charger. He said that would solve the problem and it did, but only temporarily. As of July, my phone won't charge AT ALL. I have to prop it certain ways to trick it to charge, but even after an hour and a half, and it says its fully charged, it IS NOT and when I try to use it, it dies immediately. Now I have no use of my phone because it won't hold a charge. Will ANYONE at Sprint PCS help me? I have always taken my phone in when the problems were in their infancy. Now the problems have worsened and I feel I have nowhere to go for help. I want someone to help me and let me know that I'm not giving my money away to a company that could care less if I am a satisfied customer or not.",negative,negative,0.9784153559291824,0.017211196551528942,0.004373447519288709

"I didn't get this phone for top-of-the-line features. The camera is inferior to those on the new Sony Ericsson phones, but I didn't buy a new phone for a camera (already have a digicam).

The sound and speakerphone are great, the reception hasn't failed me yet, and the battery time is decent for such a vibrant display (it's huge) and small form factor.

"I purchased this phone @the price of $264. I previously owned the V60 and was dissapointed at the features and the major antenna problem. I also had difficulty justifying upgrading to the GSM/GPRS network. Motorola listened to customer feedback, and delivered a phone loaded with features. It's not quite a PDA but darn close. The phone itself is heavy, solid and sturdy, which leads me to believe its fairly durable, however, I did find a reccuring ""glitch"" in the display function. Which became quite annoying, as I couldn't read the time when I needed to. The biggest flaw I found in the phone was the battery life. I recently spent the weekend in seattle, and was fortunate that I had the charger with me, because I had to recharge 3 times that weekend.

"I bought this hoping many of the stellar reviews would trump the many poor reviews, but unfortunately it turned out to not be the case for me. I ordered the item to be able to charge my new AT&T Inspire 4G, by HTC. It's a battery hog, so having a portable recharge would be great. I opened the box, and was really excited because the product is sexi to look at... it's not one of the dark black boxy electronics you usually associate with this type of product. It's curvy and nice looking. Initial read of the instructions proved to be a challenge, as it's clearly a manual that was written in Chinese and then translated and converted to english for North American sale. It was a bit contradictory and vague in a couple aspects, so I went online and watched the how-to, just so I could say with certainty I was using it properly. I charged it initially for 24 hours (it recommends 4-6 hours), and the instruction manual that came with it said one light will flash when it was completed charging. After 24 hours, TWO lights were still charging. I went onto their website and it states that when charging is complete, the light should remain on and solid. However this was not the case for me. I decided based on the specs, 24 hours should have been more than enough to charge it (by technological spec 5 hours from complete drain to full charge is all it should take). I plugged in my device, and immediately all 4 lights lit up on the battery pack indicating full capacity. After 5 minutes, it dropped to 3, then after 10 minutes it went to 2... At this point I contacted the manufacturer. They were quick to respond that it's likely defective. I questioned if they see this a lot and they said yes. I asked why they don't resolve it and they said (in broken english) that it was what people expect for half the price of the competition. Seems a bit odd of a response from them. To me I'd want to put out the best (usable) product for the price, or not put out a product, but hey, whatever. BOTTOM LINE: Amazon is issuing me a refund as I'm sending this one back. Normally I'd give the benefit of the doubt and re-order another one, but given the less than impressive response from the manufacturer, I'm planning on returning for a refund. I'm going to order the Zagg Sparq 2.0, which gets great reviews. At almost 2x the price, I'll have to suck it up and pay for it, but I suppose if I want a product that comes with warranty and support, that's the cost of it. I also learned that Amazon doesn't have a lot of flexibility in their marketplace seller practices, so they said their hands are tied. I'll stick to ordering direct from Amazon going forward. :-(",negative,negative,0.9405326286862252,0.04481330527988806,0.014654066033886758

"Delivery of this product took only three days. Prior to using this cellular signal booster in my home my Cingular serviced cell phone showed only two bars, my other Sprint serviced cell phone was the same. The signals were lost in different parts of the house. This is not a huge house. With this YX510 dual band booster I can get four bars in most areas of my home and two to three on the porches. However, depending on where I place the indoor antenna I get stronger or weaker signals in various portions of the house. You definitely want to try different rooms and locations within those rooms to find your best location. I will purchase another 20 to 30 feet of cable to allow me more maneuvering ability with the unit. The outside antenna is best placed on the outside of the house. I tried it near a window without much signal improvement, then in the attic with more signal improvement. But the best placement was outside on the roof. All in all, I am glad to have this unit since the cell phone signals at my house are strong and reliable enough to replace a land line telephone.",positive,positive,0.043733644845737926,0.21772197929442635,0.7385443758598358

"Got this case as a gift from a friend who warned me about the possibility of ""pants calls"" (inadvertent calls due to the function button being pressed while in the case). I looked at the case for a while, though, and was pretty sure that it wouldn't be a problem if I clipped it to my belt. It worked fabulously for two days, and then I took a walk on my lunch break and discovered later that day that the headset was gone. The strap that keeps the headset in the case is fastened with velcro, and it seems this must have gotten snagged on my jacket and come open. I retraced my steps (the whole 2 miles) but found nothing. My analysis is that if you can put up with ""pants calls"" during a brief ""break-in"" period, the elastic sides will stretch enough that it will no longer be a problem. However, during this time the velcro closure starts to weaken and bend. Once this happens, anything moving over the case (a jacket, a shirt, even your arm) may cause the strap to come undone. With the now-stretched elastic, the case just doesn't hold the headset securely without the strap, so the headset tends to fall out easily. I would suggest another alternative, though I haven't yet found one that fits the H700. ***UPDATE*** I recently spoke with the friend who gave me this case and found that he had deliberately cut the elastic to make it looser (to avoid inadvertent calls). Due to this fact, I can only partially blame the design for the loss of my headset (the velcro closure was still weak). That said, I still stand by my one star rating. The case still seems like it would not hold the headset securely, and the pressure still causes it to make calls when you don't want it to.",negative,neutral,0.11679126950063999,0.8643386532317923,0.018870077267567793

"I give a 3 because this product is confusing. Spend the extra 2 bucks and get the carry case, and all the extra charging adapters, so you can use your phone or your computer to charge your headset. As far as it falling off. It never has. I was worried at first, so I gave it a test. My glasses flew off before the headset even felt like it was going to go anywhere, however, I had a horrible headache after I shook my head that much. So take my word, if you get it in correctly it is not going to fall off. This headset can be a bit bad in noisy situations. I use mine to listen to music off of my laptop between calls from my cell phone! Get the noise canceling headset 645 if you're going to use it in a noisy place. But the 645 won't work with 2 devices at once, like the 640, the 645 requires you to re-connect. It is a trade off, so choose wisely.

"!!!THIS REVIEW ONLY APPLIES TO THE VERIZON WIRELESS MODELS!!! As a former owner of this phone, and several others, I know that this phone is terrible! In fact, all Verizon Wireless Phones today are terrible; and I am waiting for my contract to run out to switch. I am currently using an old used phone I bought off E-bay to hold me over. 1. This phone is very fragile; my old phones I could accidentally drop many times before they became un-usable; this one fell once (from no more than 3 feet) and that ""beautiful face"" was cracked from side to side; thank god I had insurance. 2. All Verizon Wireless phones have the same operating system/interface now that is terrible! You can barely customize anything; some of the worst things: a. You can only customize one or two of the 4 shortcut keys on the front page; the other two are ""locked"" by Verizon to use features that cost money! b. The two soft keys on the front page are not customizable anymore c. There are only 3 or 4 alarm clocks and none are renameable (for reminders) d. Using the calendar; if you need to reschedule an appointment for the next day you'll have to create a whole new event and delete the old one as you cannot just roll over the date of the current day to ""tomorrow."" e. For text entry the iTap (predictive text) is not the default and most importantly cannot be made the default. This means, that if you need to type out a text message or a calendar appointment you'll have to switch each time to the iTap entry mode. f. You cannot change the color of menus; you're stuck with the ugly red and black theme everywhere g. Basically, if you are used to and like the Motorola OS/Interface you're SOL. This Verizon OS really is just a small step above those phones with 3 or 4 buttons that your grandpa or child would use in emergencies; it is dumbed down and handcuffs you. On purpose I'm sure; read about the class action lawsuit regarding the Motorola v710 (a phone that I also owned and was very familiar with); this Verizon OS makes that v710 seem like a super computer. 3. I went through 4 phones before I went to an old one. Every single one would work for a few days and then the ringer would not ring or the earpiece volume would drop to near in-audible. I suspect this is thanks to the shabby Verizon Wireless OS/Interface About the only thing this phone is good for is for teenagers (and those who refuse to grow up) who waste their time and money using this phone as a crappy MP3 and video player or poor quality camera. Oh and I believe even the typical Motorola options for the camera are crippled by the Verizon OS. Oh, and did I mention that if you DID want to use this phone as a crappy MP3 player you'd have to plug in an earphone adapter that takes up the phone charging port? I wonder how many songs you can crank out of it before your phone needs charging; especially if you use Bluetooth like I do. This phone and every other Verizon Wireless Phone (with the exception of Smart Phones) are worthless! They are crippled by the Verizon Wireless OS and I do not recommend them to anyone. It is a shame because Verizon has very good coverage; at least in my area.",negative,negative,0.7531832008484519,0.20663797390845517,0.04017882524309288

"Simply put, the sound quality of this headset is AMAZING, and everything they claim it to be on their website and advertisement. The noise canceling works impressively, and as an Electronics engineer, I really have to salute the design team behind that technology. The bad, is the horrible mechanical design of this unit. while it does ""look"" pretty slick, and very modern, the mechanisms for fitting in on one's ear, are very poorly designed. The removable ear-bud peace (which they provide more than one size to accommodate users) well, it keeps falling off... or getting stick in the ear, as the whole unit falling off. It is not secure in place AT ALL, and since I really was impressed with the sound quality, I tried over and over to find a nice fit, (finally glued that piece!). Also, the metal loop that goes over the ear, is not very convenient, and you have to choose right or left ear operation to install the proper loop.

It comes with a ridiculous charging case so that is an extra thing that you are going to have to take with you when you travel, and the charger itself is gigantuan. So to be clear, there is no way to charge this thing without the superfluous case. One more thing to carry, break, or lose. Too much junk to keep track of. It also comes with a bunch of adapters for foreign power supplies. How strange. And a nice silver cloth pouch with matching design curlicues. And a great big full booklet manual with super tiny print. The unit works passably well for one without noise reduction.

"Product is just as advertised and stated by the many positive reviews. The headset stays on my ear all day and I hardly realize it's there. It is very comfortable and does not come off even with the hardest of head shakes. The control are not that hard, just takes a few times to get use to.

"The design original idea is great, but the design of the clip or the material chosen was wrong. The belt clip is very weak where it pivots on the pin holding the springs. For this material, the material thickness is too thin to take much stress without breaking where the pin goes through the pivot point of the hinge. I bought my first one and loved it right up until it broke, while I was stooping down to pick something off the floor. The phone was rotated 90 degrees from vertical to minimize pressure and stress on the hinge from the phone. It broke when I squatted down to pick up something and my iPhone 3G bounced off the floor at me feet. Luckily the fall was a short distance and the phone survived the fall, probably because it landed on an area of the phone covered by the case. When I saw the case on sale for $0.01 each, with $4.95 ea. shipping, I bought 4 so I would have a few back up cases when one breaks. I am already on #2 case, because the first one I used broke at the hinge pivot point just like my first one. I keep hoping I will get a stronger batch because I like the design. The fit of the phone is very tight with the face of the phone protected and is impossible to use if you try to put the face of the phone visible, but unprotected. It would be difficult to remove with long fingernails. The manufacturer needs this feedback; I hope Amazon forwards these reviews to them.

"**************** TWO WEEK UPDATE **************** The info below under 'Original Review' is just that.....the original review......this is a two (to three) week update after having the phone and integrating it into my life. The camera is workable at best. Both the still and video cameras should be upgraded in the next update and could have been upgraded in the move from 600 to 650. Still functional though. The mpeg viewer works great. I downloaded a little mpeg clip through the palm install tool and it played perfectly with relatively good clarity. This is a nice feature....... The phone itself works fine with no problems and the programmable buttons have worked well since I set them all up. I had a Treo 300 a couple years back and this phone works functionally better....... Versamail continues to be my favorite software installed. I have used it daily and have both mine and my wife's bellsouth.net accounts set up and functioning well. Haven't really noticed any major glitches in it. I have downloaded a couple games over the web into the memory of the palm apps and that worked really well. In addition, I've installed a couple from the desktop with the same results. Functionally, it's a pretty smooth process that is working well..... I really like the buttons and thumbpad and have progressed to where I can do most if not all the functions of the phone without having to pull out the stylus. At first, I thought I'd miss the Graffitti functionality of my Sony Clie NX70 but I do not. The keyboard works well except for my large clumsy fingers and they're starting to figure it out pretty well. Only thing I've noticed on that is when sending messages with Versamail, there doesn't seem to be any great rules for when it auto capitalizes words. That's pretty nit-picky though.........

Regarding BT5020 I'd say the next level would be peering to more than 2 devices ""simultaneously"". Also you can improve the design because it's a little bit uncomfortable on the ear and doesn't fit so well as the BT500 did. Maybe because of those rubber attachable pieces that the BT500 has.

"I previously used the original Jawbone, became a big fan of Aliph's noise-cancellation technology, and was looking forward to the new Jawbone 2 to solve the few minor poblems that I had with the original such as excessive wind noise in even a minimal breeze. After reading the reviews here and noting the wide variance in customer satisfaction, primarily due to poor fit problems, I also purchased both the clear Jabra regular Gels and the Mini-Gels, that some others claimed to be the solution to the fit problem, along with the new Jawbone 2. I can confirm that the biggest issue is poor fit - no matter what combination of the supplied 4 earhooks and 3 rubber earbuds that I used, I could not keep the unit in my ear or keep the white voice sensor nub in constant contact with my cheek. This constant cheek contact is critical for noise suppression to work properly and to prevent distorting or clipping your own transmitted speech. I first tried the regular Jabra Gels (package of 6 complex-shaped earbuds) but found that they did not fit tightly enough onto the Jawbone 2 ear post. Next I tried the Mini-Gels which consisted of 2 small round earbuds and 2 larger oval earbuds. The oval Mini-Gel earbuds worked perfectly for me but there were a couple installation tips and tricks needed to get proper fit: First, the oval Mini-Gel fits over the Jawbone 2 ear post very tightly and it takes a bit of effort to carefully stretch it to fit over the Jawbone ear post. Once seated, it is almost impossible to rotate the oval Mini-Gel's angle in relation to the Jawbone's microphone boom, so position it correctly initially (see next tip for proper position). Secondly, the end of the oval, furthest from the ear post, must be positioned between 0 degrees and 20 degrees above the axis of the microphone boom in order to seat into my ear properly and have the voice sensor nub at the end of the microphone boom properly seated against my cheek (thank you to the other reviewer who put me on the right track with his 15 degree above angle). Thirdly, to wear this combination properly, insert the oval Mini-Gel into your ear with the Jawbone microphone boom slightly above horizontal, and then rotate the Jawbone downward so the microphone boom is pointing somewhere between the tip of your nose and your lips. This combination fits me snugly and coomfortably without the need to use any earloop. I can usually wear it all day without hardly adjusting it. So now that I have proper fit, my Jawbone 2 finally performs as intended. The noise-cancellation is excellent and the wind noise has been greatly improved. However, had I not discovered the Jabra oval Mini-Gel solution, I would have returned the Jawbone 2 as being totally unusable due to poor fit with the supplied selection of earloop and earbud accessorys. Hopefully, Aliph is paying attention and will license the Mini-Gels from Jabra! With proper fit for my Jawbone 2, my Pros and Cons: Pros - best of any headset for background noise cancellation and fairly good wind noise removal, extremely light weight and comfortable, good battery life (although less than original Jawbone), improved magnetic charger cable. Cons - while the front surface pushswitch to answer/end a call is now much easier to activate compared to the original, the problem has now become that it's almost impossible to adjust the headset position without inadvertently pushing the answer/end talk button and hanging up a call, even when attempting to only grip the side surfaces of the unit. Bottom line: Make sure it fits you well or you will be very disappointed in the performance. If necessary, buy the clear Jabra Mini-Gels (not the regular Jabra Gels) for proper fit. Buy the Jawbone 2 from someplace that will let you return it if you cannot get it to fit your ear/face. If you can get it to fit, it will be the best headset you have owned.",neutral,negative,0.5797256055402271,0.15045752842696433,0.2698168660328085

"we purchased this cell phone to go with the pay-as-you-go, AT&T Go Phone Service. The black painted matte finish starting to tip slightly on the edge on one side. Because of this, I don't think the finish is very durable on the long run. If nothing else, the voice quality is fairly good to me. Initially, the battery doesn't seem to hold a charge for a long but gradually appear to improved with more charge cycles. The digital camera resolution is quite low but adequate for simple snapshots. Because of limited storage, the digital camera is probably useful in case of auto accidents or other uses. This phone has many other features that is not supported or optional with our service provider such as net access and IM as well as online gaming. Although I haven't tried it yet, it's supposed to also record videos. Like I said earlier, because of limited storage it would not be practical to use. This phone uses a miniature USB port like those on some Cannon digital camera. I've tried hooking this phone up to my computer using my digital camera patch cord to see what would happened. My computer wasn't able to do anything with it. I found out that in order for the phone to interface with the computer, the optional software is required. This phone also would not charge without the needed software. Although, this feature is not important to me. Final thoughts: As a basic no thrill cell phone it's okay.

"I owned an LG VX6100 before this one and was happy with it. I've had this new 8700 for about a week, and I'm probably going to return it. I'm thinking of going with an LG VX5300. This phone isn't for me. I want phones that conform to the shape of my hand. This phone does just the opposite. My only complaint is really the overall design of the phone. The metallic shell is beautiful, but it's a bit prone to smudges. The external screen is extremely difficult to see in the sunlight and I can barely check the time. Its SD card slot is located behind the battery, so that's a huge pain to handle. Also, this keypad is horrible. Obviously, it was designed so the phone could be thin. I can barely text message without pressing wrong keys and making mistakes. On a lighter side, the phone has a tremendous amount of features like bluetooth, USB mass storage, mp3 player, 2.0 MP camera etc. But, it's still hard for me to handle, and I prefer a more rounded phone with well-shaped keys and an easier-to-use menu.",neutral,neutral,0.18946737557745047,0.46310829196791864,0.347424332454631
"I just finished boxing up my Supertooth 3 for return back to Amazon. I had it for 3 weeks and used it with my Blackberry Curve 8320. It worked as advertised--loud speaker, the other person could actually hear me (unlike the majority of Bluetooth devices), address book sync worked (not automatic, you have to select ""transfer address book"" from the Blackberry menu), NAME of caller was spoken when the caller was in my address book, NUMBER of caller was spoken otherwise, long battery life, effective magnetic clip, and automatic pairing when I got in the car. So why am I returning it? Because there is one big problem. When I exit the car, the bluetooth connection does not automatically disconnect until I am out of range (about 30 feet). If I am still in range and receive a call, I can answer with my handset but the audio will go to the speakerphone that is now locked in the car. Transferring the call on a Blackberry is a big deal. Press a button (second from the left), then use the trackball to select ""disconnect ST 3"", then click the trackball. This might sound easy when you're sitting at your desk, but just try it in a dark windy parking lot. Moreoever, the entire procedure goes like this. The phone rings. I quickly have to think if I am still in range. If I might be, I have to quickly look at the tiny bluetooth icon on the ringing Blackberry to determine if I am still connected. If so, I have to hit a button to answer, then quickly hit another button to bring up a menu, then turn the trackball while being careful to stop at the right menu choice, then click the trackball. Sounds easy? Just try it. (This actually happened to me a few times.) I could turn off the Supertooth every time I exit the car, and then turn it back on when I enter. But this is a big deal too. You have to hold down the Main Function Button for 5 seconds before it turns off. Just try doing this every time you exit the car.",neutral,neutral,0.29027543750357326,0.6001150204951619,0.10960954200126487
"I have been around the block with cell phones. I have had virtually every cell phone that Verizon has to offer from their free phones to the Voyager. I just recently changed back to Verizon from AT&T. I have had the iPhone. Some of the major bonuses that the EnV2 has to offer: -Full QWERTY keyboard for texting -Outside screen and predictive text when you need to shoot off a quick message. -Decent speed on the operating system. -Loud ringtones -Great battery life -Rubberized back Some features that aren't so great: -It looks like a calculator from the outside. -The front screen is somewhat small and low quality. -Slow internet service -Even with screen protectors, the keyboard scratches easily. Overall, this is a very good phone. I have been extremely happy with this phone (which says a lot). The texting may get a while to get used to because of the QWERTY keyboard, but it is a good phone. Overall phone quality is excellent and the messaging features are a big bonus.

"I had been told by a few friends that boosters don't work but after 8 years of struggling with cell coverage just fine right outside my house but nothing inside, I decided to give this one a try because of its many good reviews and I have to say it did not disappoint.

My only complaint was the install was a bit more complex than I was lead to believe but thankfully I had an attic and was able to run the coax cable down where my cable TV coax went.

"Let me start by saying this is a great headset. Comfortable, lightweight, and easy to hear and operate. The layout of the controls is spot-on; they're easy to use and locate. The button on the end of the mic boom is awesome for answering and ending calls. If your phone has voice-dialing, holding down that button will launch your phone's voice dialing feature. The volume rocker was easy to use; however, pushing it in to mute the mic produced the same tone as swiveling the rocker to change the volume, so you never really knew if you had muted your call or just adjusted the volume. They really should have had different tones associated with those functions, especially since it's two distinct functions in one control. Range and battery life were all outstanding. Charging is quick, and the status light is handy. Pairing was a snap; worked first time. It's comfortable enough to wear for long periods, and it's very unobtrusive. Not so much that you'd forget it's there, but enough to leave on and not bug you. This headset has only two downfalls. One: no noise reduction circuitry. The microphone on the headset works very well; unfortunately, too well if there's *any* sort of noise in the area -- another conversation, a TV twenty feet away, a barking dog in the next room -- were all as clearly heard by my caller as my own voice, prompting her to ask me to move to another room where it wasn't quite so loud. And trying to use it in the car, forget it. I was told that I was barely distinguishible from the noise of the car. Two: The manual. This is one of those manuals where they give you one small illustration and 327 different languages (actually, it's only 7, but it feels like 327) on each page, so the pairing instructions took up about 5 pages, but about half a napkin's worth of content. That's a thoroughly annoying feature; so annoying to me that I skipped the manual altogether and went straight to the website to get the instructions all in one language. That's significant enough to me to be a downfall. All in all, this is a great entry-level Bluetooth headset, priced right for the ""value-conscious"" consumer. But for anyone who expects superior quality conversations, rivaling those offered by your ""actual phone,"" I would pay more for a better quality headset with some noise-cancelling circuitry. I suggest looking at the Jabra FreeSpeak BT250. It's got the same general wrap-around-the-ear design, but it's a little more than the Plantronics (about twice the price at the time of this writing). However, it's still under $100, and with built-in noise reduction, it's well worth it, IMHO.",neutral,positive,0.009738659731095533,0.4586569587473995,0.5316043815215049

"Before you buy this case (or any case), you have to ask yourself what you're really looking to get.

It's designed to prevent scratches to the back of the device and the ceramic antenna cover also on the back. It provides a raised edge around all the buttons and the screen to protect them from scratches and damage resulting from minor drops. The case also has what appear to be clips for an optional belt clip, but Agent 18 isn't offering one at this time. The key feature to this case is the way it assembles. The top portion fits very snugly onto the upper half of the phone, but the bottom half fits more loosely and clips into the upper half. What this allows is super easy removal of the bottom half for docking. I've been doing this for weeks now and have yet to accidentally remove the lower portion. It's a perfect balance.

"I got this nav unit for a quick road trip that I had to do on my own. Having used various TomTom and Garmin units on prior occasions, it was difficult for me to decide which was the better deal (Garmin 200 or TomTom 3rd Edition). I finally settled for Garmin and have not been disappointed. Pros 1. Slim low profile unit. 2. Achieves satellites locks quickly and retains it for the longest time within tunnels and bridges. 3. Efficient routing. 4. Extensive POI database (though quirky at times! It once sent me half a mile past walmart and said I was arriving at Walmart as I reached an open wooded area on my right...) 5. Responsive Touch Screen. Though I do have issues with an alphabetic keypad for text entry. I am so used to the QWERTY that anything else is a hassle. By the way text entry is predictive (For example, you enter state as D-E- before you complete it Garmin Suggests Delaware) Cons 1. 3.5"" display might seem a little tiny. 2. No text to speech functionality. The lady mumbles ""Turn Right"" ""Turn Left"". You have to see the screen to check the exact street name that you have to turn into. I guess you will fet that for Nuvi 260 if I am not mistaken. 3. No Route Summary as text option. I love that option in TomTom. Its basically a list of directions with cumulative distances that looks like a Mapquest directions list. I find that good for planning your route when you want to avoid specific bridges or tunnels (with Garmin you have to thumb through each turn and it can get tedious). Bottom Line This unit works for me! I have been on the road pretty often having to re-route and find new places all the time. I find this a very handy GPS unit. Recommended if you don't have a lot of dough to spare.",positive,neutral,0.04986605094123831,0.5124048733109485,0.4377290757478132
"First, Ignore the comments from people complaining about the lack of features - that is EXACTLY what makes this phone different. If you wanted a phone with a camera [that takes bad pictures], an MP3 player [with bad quality sound], a PDA [with crippled keyboard/software] or a GPS receiver [that takes forever to lock and eats batteries], then you should have known this isn't for you. You would ignore anyone that would buy a minivan and then complain that it isn't a race car and you should also ignore anyone that buys this phone and then complains about what is missing. And almost everything IS missing. It's a phone - a very good phone. An unpretentious device to make/receive calls and it does this better than probably 99% of the phones you can buy today. It has great sound quality, a very large and easy to read display, and remarkable battery life. If you need to send/receive text messages, it can do that, but the large display makes this a capability for occasional use only. For those of us accustomed to nested menus and linked feature lists, operating the phone is almost too simple and most people trip themselves up in the beginning because they expect it be more complicated than it is. It will make a phone connection when other phones can't find the signal and it will hold on to the signal much better than any of the 'full featured' phones I've owned. You can read it at night and in the noon day sun. You can hear it in a car with the windows down. You use it for a week without needing a recharger.(4 and a half hours of talk time and nearly two weeks of standby time). For what it is - you can't find a better value. If you want a cell phone that will do everything but wipe your, uh, nose [but do it poorly], then you really shouldn't expect to get that from a phone that costs $33 outright without contract (and you know it...) The English Manual is available online and it is small because there isn't much to explain. To get it to ring (louder), simply push the UP button on the large, round rocker switch in the middle. To ring quieter, or go into vibrate mode, simply pus the Down button until it vibrates.

"Pros: lightweight, overall sound quality Cons: connectivity issues, limited range (not 10m), some echoing, quirks I bought a couple of these today. Great headset but has a few misgivings that should be noted. I didn't see these cons from the many reviews I've read prior to buying the Z9i. Perhaps I wasn't as diligent as I'd thought. My initial thoughts are as follows. First, I've experienced some connectivity issues with the Z9i being on the opposite side of where my phone is located (i.e. pocket, purse, etc.). My Razr kept disconnecting and reconnecting throughout the day whenever my phone was on the opposite side of the Z9i. I decided to hold my Razr in my right hand while walking and wearing the Z9i on my right ear. It still kept disconnecting and reconnecting but only a couple of times. These devices were only 3+ FEET apart with no obstruction. Occassionally, I experienced hearing feedbacks/echoes of my own voice through the earpiece after I'd spoken. On 2 separate outgoing calls, the phone connected and the minute counter on my phone showed such but the Z9i remained silent. I had to redial on those 2 calls and the other party said their phone connected but they could not hear me. I did not mute the phone (pressing and holding the - volume button for 3 seconds). Max isolation reaction was ""Wow"" from the person I called after informing them my window was halfway down while doing almost 70mph on the freeway. The 2nd Z9i was for my wife who was with me. She was experiencing connection quirks and issues but didn't want to blame the Z9i until she performs her own controlled evaluation of her unit. Needless to say, the incoming sound quality appears to be very good for both of us. Clarity a plus. I didn't feel the need to rehash 'Pros' & 'Cons' already mentioned in other reviews. I just wanted to share my own experience and hope that others may have another insight into this product to help them with their own purchasing decision. Perhaps I'm being a tad critical to only award the Z9i 3 stars instead of 4 but with many rave reviews to its credit, I didn't expect these shortcomings that I experienced. Maybe I got a bad unit? My assessment was made after 7 hours of usage (active and standby) and 37 incoming and outgoing calls in total from my Z9i only. UPDATE: July 4, 2008 Assessment after a few days of usage. The range appears limited as explained in my initial post. When my Razr is in the pant pocket on the opposite side of the ear wearing the Z9i, Bluetooth disconnects & reconnects about every 1-2 minutes. Very annoying because you hear beeps every time this happens. Additionally, my Razr has indicated weak Bluetooth signals and suggested using the handset at least 8 times in the last 3 days during calls. This occured a couple of times when I was driving my car and wearing the Z9i on my right ear with the Motorola Razr less than 2 feet away near the gear shifter. The problematic silent connection (as mentioned initially) still persists. I had to redial a couple of times because the other party could not hear me even though both parties' phones showed a connection. One of my friend is also mentioning these problems with their Z9i to me. Their phone is a Sony Ericsson Z610i. I will begin troubleshooting (i.e. checking for software updates/compatibility issues with my Razr, etc) and issue another update in a week, if not sooner. These problems are becoming a hindrance. UPDATE: July 14, 2008 After almost 2 weeks of daily use, I am still experiencing all the problems I've detailed above. However, the disconnect-reconnecting issue is not consistent. In some areas (outdoors & indoors) it is frequent while at other times it behaves normally. It still occurs when I wear the Z9i on the opposite side of the phone. I did not have access to any other phones to test other than our Razr & Samsung T629. My biggest issue is the 'Bluetooth signal is weak. Use handset?' prompt. It is very frustrating to be driving when all of a sudden, my bluetooth connection is lost and I have to pick up the phone and try to switch it over to speakerphone. Sometimes when I'm not quick enough, it will re-connect with the Z9i again and the party I was speaking to would ask what happened. This has occured all too frequently for me and is posing a safety risk while I'm driving. My wife is also experiencing similar problems with her Z9i/Samsung T629 combo and doesn't use it (Z9i) as much since she hates to deal with these issues. My friend who owns the Sony Ericsson Z610i only experienced similar problems but they were very limited and she is 'satisfied' with her Z9i. As for my and my wife's Z9i, I will repack them and auction them on ebay as soon as we find a better alternative. This is only our experience. It may be our phones, frequency interference, etc... any number of factors we may not know about. Apparently several users are very happy with their units. It would be nice if those who posted positive reviews would come back & provide updates so we could better assess this product. Good luck everyone!

"I upgraded from the Treo 600 and let me tell you, this is a BIG upgrade. If you have the 650, it may or may not be worth it, but if you don't yet have one of these devices or have a 600, I would give it a strong recommendation. Negatives: 1. I have installed the software on my laptop and desktop and have tried everything under the sun to successfully sync the device to no avail. There are NO customer service numbers, only internet help sessions. I have tried every single thing under the internet sessions and have still yet to successfully sync. I am currently frustrated beyond belief because I love the phone, but I can't sync all of my previous data to it. If any of you have any advice, please let me know! 2. It's the same size as the 600 and 650. It would have been nice to see a progression to a smaller device. 3. The Windows interface is different than the Palm and if you are a Palm OS lover, this device is not for you. Postives- 1. I actually like the Windows interface slightly better. 2. The ability to sync Word and Excel is huge. 3. The almost broadband internet access is the real deal. It's not quite that fast, but pretty darn fast for checking web based email on the go or looking something up real quick. 4. The sound on of the person you are talking to is much better than the 600 and probably equivalent to the 650 from what I hear. 5. The camera is a nice 1.3 megapixel and takes decent pictures, but has no flash or zoom. The pictures are pretty good for a phone, however. 6. The TODAY screen is nice and the ability to have your speed dials with their picture on that screen is a nice touch. Overall, this phone would get a 4/5 if I were able to get it to sync easily. The fact that I have probably spent 12 hours of effort is exhausting, disappointing and completely frustrating because I still have no solution in sight. If, however, you are able to get accomplish this task with ease, have a 600 or are looking at this vs. the 650, I would say go for it. The interface is user friendly, pleasant and refined. This phone will do it all for you...and then some.",neutral,neutral,0.03291403617457865,0.8684673597027378,0.0986186041226835

"Pros: Small design Cons: WONT STAY IN EAR! Horrible location of multi-purpse button!!! Summary: This is by far the worst bluetooth headset I have purchased. This device will not stay put in your ear for an extended period of time. No matter how you position it, it will slowly slide out. Also, the multi purpose button is in a very bad location. It's located at the very top of the device which is horrible because when you re-position the device, which you will have to do often after it slips out, you WILL touch the button. This often results in accidental hang-ups or redials. I've had this headset for less than a week and I'm already looking for a replacement for it. I wouldn't GIVE this device away.

"First off, this is a good sturdy product. I like it, it makes the cell phone (8310) easier to use - without figure prints and facial oil mark. However, there are flaws in the design: 1) The cell phone was in tray upright. It make the motion of pulling out the phone kind of awkward - I have to turn the phone around every time I pull it out of the belt. 2) Since it is sitting upright, the camera lens was not protected. It seems to rely on the transparent plastic to protect it - but it creates another problem (see 3) 3) The plastic wrap makes the image from the camera blurry, you can't really use it unless you take it off... it violates the whole purpose of having a case to begin with. I have to punch a hole on the plastic to make the camera usable. The Otterbox folks should redesign the case so that the phone will sit upside down and more plastic will extend from the bottom of the belt clip holder to protect the camera lens.

"I previously owned a 3650 (with the round keypad) so I have been very used to typing on a very small keypad. I just love this phone... The major reason that the keys are small is because the phone is small. The keypad and screen are interconnected and slide into the metal body of the phone (which is smaller than other slider phones I have seen like the Samsung). The screen is like a HD TV producing something like 275,000 colors. I have a Bluetooth connection through my laptop and after installing the Nokia CD ROM onto my computer and linking the two together (which was very easy) I sent one of my favorite photos to the phone, setting it as my wallpaper which is gorgeous. The software lets you send music and backup phone numbers and data from your phone to computer and visa versa. The call quality is exceptional, and the WAP internet is very fast. The 8801 also has some type of 3D engine built into the OS, which helps to produce amazing imaging. Battery life is somewhat less than I am used to, however, after letting the battery drain dead and then recharging for 24 hrs. (using the backup provided rotationally) I have actually been getting 3 hrs of talk time as suggested. One last thing that I love about the phone aside from that fact that it looks amazing and the OS is very easy to navigate (as are all Nokia's) is that the phones SAR's rating for tissue radiation from a cellular device is one of the lowest of any phone at .45 which is personally important to me (the federal limit is a little under 2).

"First off, I can't seem to find the perfect Bluetooth headset. I've been on a search for the perfect one, and so far I'm on headset #7. But anyway, I bought this one because I have multiple phones, a razor and a blackberry from work. Because of this, I thought the multipoint tech was a nice feature to have. Let me tell you, it is. All you have to do is push the top button and the talk button and you seemlessly move from one device to the other. The sound quality is also good with this headset, both inbound and outbound. I have a loud car (350z convertible) so wind noise is still something that it doesn't hold up to, but this one performs well compared to most. However, the most disappointing thing is that even when the battery is full, the headset disconnects from the phone all the time. I can talk sometimes for hours and no problem. Other times, I talk for about 5 minutes and it drops. If it wasn't for this problem, I would give it 5 stars, but this is very annoying. One last thing, and this applies for all headsets...it sure would be nice to standardize all plugs, and I think motorola and blackberries are pretty much all mini-usb plugs.

"I really wanted to like this product. I'm not a big fan of earpieces and having small ears, so I find it difficult to find headsets that are both comfortable and do not fall out of my ear. I had previously purchased the Blueant V1 headset for my husband and I read so many good reviews that I though this speakerphone would work well. It does not. First of all the visor clip presented a problem, if you have thick hard plastic sun visors it might not fit. Second, no one can clearly hear me. I have to hang up and redial using my handset which defeats the whole purpose. Also sometimes the person's voice would just fade for no apparent reason, I was not touching the volume button. The voice activation is limited to your cell phone. Transferring numbers from my cell to the Supertooth was too labor intensive. I really really wanted this to work. But alas for me, it does not. I'm sending it back to Amazon and will be ordering the V1. As a point of comparison my previous headset was a Plantronics 510. The sound quality was okay, but not great and no noise canceling.

"Pairing this device to both a Treo 750 and AT&T 8525 was easy enough. However, even though the manual says that that the device will pair with up to 5 phones, switching between them didn't quite work. For example, after BlueAnt successfully works with the Treo, I would turn off both the BlueAnt and Treo's bluetooth. After that I would enable 8525's bluetooth and then turn on BlueAnt. The 8525 takes a long time before it'll connect with BlueAnt (keep in mind I already went thru the pairing setup process for both phones). The same can be said about the Treo if I do the reverse (make sure 8525 works first, and then try to connect with Treo). BlueAnt's connection is almost instantenously if you only connect with the same phone as the previous connection. This is not a big issue since the wife and I don't switch cars that often. However the straw that broke the camel's back is that the microphone shaft refused to remain in the off (retracted) position after 1 day worth of use. It seemed that there is at least 1 more report of this from previous Amazon reviews (about 2 weeks ago). The microphone shaft is the reason I bought this product.

"So I bought this because my old trackball decided to fall out and all the scrollers fell out as well. It's pretty cheap. We have to understand that this isn't an OEM replacement but a third party so it's not gonna be perfect. The ball feels a little gritty but it's just something you have to get use to. It will probably become smoother later on after repeated use. When I installed this into my 8120, it would barely scroll up or down. I had to spend about 5 mins getting to the settings and change the vertical sensitivity of the trackball for it to be similar to the old one. Even though it's closer to normal, it's still not that great as when I scroll up or down it tends to scroll the opposite direction at times. A little inconvenient but nonetheless it works.

"The Jabra BT-3030 is a good stereo bluetooth alternative to bluetooth headphones. They allow you to use your own wired headphones too, so you don't look like a completely silly. The bluetooth phone interface works well too and shuts down the music when you have an incoming call. Music comes back on after you hang up the call. I use it with a Blackberry Curve, LG Dare and an iPod with a iCombi bluetooth adapter. You can also connect to two devices at the same time. I connect to the iPod for music and the Blackberry for calls, at the same time. I recommend them with a good bluetooth signal. The iCombi is a barely decent bluetooth transmitter, so the BT-3030 doesn't always have the best sound.",neutral,neutral,0.0314453837796955,0.8805919503015914,0.08796266591871307

"This is the very best bluetooth earpiece I have worn and used. It connects instantly, usually lasts for 2-3 days when left on 24/7 with 3-4 hours of talking. It's true it picks up background noises-- just as with ANY wired mic. The beauty is that there is NO connection static with the BT500. Voice commands at a touch, connect and disconnect at touch. Easy, immediate pairing. The earpiece even recongizes whether I'm using a silent or loud profile and changes whether it produces a ringing tone (to match the phone's audible profile) or no tone (for the phone's silent profile). I'm paired with a Nokia 6682. Every Motorola product I tried produced extreme static noise on the called/caller end from a flaky bluetooth connection. None of that here. The only complaints I have are getting the thing on initially-- it's a snug fit over the ear. If you haven't worn a Jabra product before, all I can say is it's different in that it fits inside the ear instead of just laying against the outside of your ear like a traditional phone handset speaker. Once on however, I often forget I have it on. Second complaint is from the general public. Most people are used to that pager-sized backlit Motorola hanging off of everyone else's face. With the BT500 I often get comments about my ""earring"" from guys, my ""hearing aid"" from children and the elderly, or being ""assimilated into the Borg"" from (fellow) techies.

"As there are some other excellent reviews here, I am concentrating on what has not been written. Sound quality varies, depending on how you use the headphones. Basically, both comparisons with AM radio and HiFi Sound are more or less true. Here is why. I find the earphones of an excellent quality at low to middle sound levels, delivering sound better than my Koss Porta Pro and on par with Sennheiser PC-150. But this is only true, when the earphones are wired to the source. It is also loud, at 50% PB output level sound get unbearable. Good sensitivity and sound detail. Using the including Bluetooth dongle, quality slips to the level of FM radio. Using it with iPod, which does not offer that good output quality (at least no comparison to my Al PowerBook 1.5GHz), quality slips a bit further. This is partially due to limitation of the Bluetooth and the fact that sound is amplified twice (both in iPod and headset). Further gets worse :(. By connecting vie Bluetooth to the PowerBook, quality does goet to the level of the AM Radio, as Mac currently do not support A2DP Bluetooth profile for improved audio quality. It is really a no go for listening to music, and Skype quality drops to the level of a normal phone. To get it working, however, there is one thing to keep in mind. I guess, Macs do not support another feature of Bluetooth, multi-access. Since I am using headset as a phone headset as well, it is constanly connected to the mobile phone. It seems like macs do not like sharing headsets, so bluetooth on the mobile phone has to be switched off. Otherwise, no problem whatsoever. Dongle-phone (SONY Ericsson K750i) combination works perfect and is REALLY cool stuff. It switches sources, once you get a call and then switches back to the iPod. Basically, I am keeping the headset, as getting rid of the wires on the go is worth the sound quality penalty. For a good quality, 3.5 mm jack is the only option for some time to come, in my opinion. So, this is an awesome product, well designed, very well built. If it suffers some quality issues, it is actually due to the limitations of the technology, not the product. I had no problems with charging, as did some other users. Another batch maybe :p. Accordingly, 5 stars for the product, 1 star penalty for inperfect technology (Bluetooth and Mac), 4 Stars in total. Oh! One annoying thing, there is a blinking blue ring light on the right earphone. At night it is really bright, so you'll end up looking like a lighthouse. During the day it is not that obvious.

"Overall I like this headset. It is the first one I've ever owned and I certainly like the convenience of being able to use my phone even when my hands are full. It is lightweight and easy to set up. The issues I have with it are: It is awkward to wear over your ear when you are also wearing glasses. The power button is difficult to operate, although I guess that helps to prevent it from accidentally turning off. But someone with very large fingers or arthritis would probably be very frustrated. I actually have to use a fingernail. It sometimes disconnects from my phone on its own. But MOST disconcerting is that my phone somehow automatically dials the last number in its memory when I have the headset connected, without me knowing it. So I can be having a person to person conversation with one person, while another person is being called by my phone. If the called person answers their phone they can hear my conversation without me ever knowing a phone call was made. Very eerie to be unknowingly overheard. And a waste of my minutes. I'm told that this is a problem inherent with bluetooth headsets in general, so now I only turn my headset on when I actually want to make a call instead of leaving it on all the time. Or I just use my phone the old school way! :) So for me, it's probably a lot of money for only a little convenience.",neutral,positive,0.23097776164372782,0.32520064255088443,0.4438215958053878

The bottom edge of the bag is not rigid enough and the posts tend to fold inward. The cover fits snugly around my Buffet Attache-style case, which is both good and bad. The good is that the case does not slide around within. The bad is that it makes opening the case nearly impossible without first removing it from the cover. Also, the zippers rub the corners of the case and I'm always concerned that the zippers may mar its leather. There is little room in the main compartment for anything besides the clarinet case. Another pocket would be nice for a clarinet stand or a spare mouthpiece. All in all, this case cover does its primary job well. I don't regret buying this cover but, if I had to replace it, I would probably look elsewhere.",neutral,neutral,0.050416065758013086,0.9049122183235535,0.044671715918433316
"Let me start by stating that I live in a major city and not the country so my issues with cell phone coverage in my car is not as troublesome as some others. However, I do occasionally lose service, which is especially frustrating when using the GPS navigation feature to find my way somewhere. The WeBoost Phone Booster is fairly straightforward when it comes to installation and activation. A small antennae is mounted to the roof of the car and a chord is run through the passenger's side door to the booster. As other reviewers have noted, the adhesive used to mount the unit is rather permanent and is not easy to move once attached to the dash. So, know exactly where one wants to place the unit before using the adhesive. As for the actual performance, I have only had one dropped call since attaching the unit and virtually no lag time when using the internet. The navigation works just fine without any error messages stating that the signal was lost. This was especially impressive considering the particularly harsh winter conditions which resulted in a lot of cloud coverage, which usually interferes with the GPS signal. Downloads speeds were also slightly improved but not significantly. Overall, I was very impressed with the results with the WeBoost phone booster. If one uses the car quite frequently for traveling, then this unit is easily a welcome addition. Overall, this is a worthy purchase for anyone looking to improve cell phone coverage in vehicles.",positive,neutral,0.00865770164699312,0.743594627873281,0.24774767047972598

"I drive a diesel truck to jobs sites then grind metal with various grinding machines. This B 250 BlueParrott works flawlessly. No one knows I am using a blue tooth nor can they hear the back groung noise! I have tried 2 different Motorolas including the H12, and 2 different Jawbones. I have talked to other blue tooth users and I get the same opinion: They are just okay. I have to talk to important clients all day to maintain business dealings; with all other blue tooths I used, I had to stop what I was doing to talk, and 70% of the time I had to switch over to the phone because of bad sound quality. With this B 250 the sound quality is as good as when I am on a land line! Don't believe me, just try one! I couldn't believe it either. After I started using this blue tooth I quickly got tired of asking people how I sounded because the answer was always the same, perfect (even with alot of back ground noise).

Sounds great. I switched the ear buds to the larger ones supplied and it fits beautifully and is quite comfortable for long periods. What lets it down is its reception - any kind of RF interference causes it to cut out incessantly which is very annoying if you're listening to music and makes phonecalls impossible. The only remedy is to hold the thing no more than 12 inches from the phone if you're in an area with a lot of RF noise (other wireless and bluetooth gadgets seem to block its signal) If you're wearing an armband or a backpack with a phone pocket built into the straps then you're set. Even having my phone in the top pocket of my shirt wasn't good enough outside. Indoors I can walk easily 8m away from it and it's crystal clear. I will say this - if you live in NY don't bother. I bought mine there and it just wasn't up to going outside. If you live (as I do) in Australia though where there isn't quite so much signal interference in the major cities then it's ok in most places.

"After owning this thing for two months the blue indicator light stopped working right. It used to blink red when turning off, and blue when turning on. However, after a while it stopped blinking red when turning off, and the blue indicator stayed on all the time, so I could never tell whether it was on or off without testing it with my phone. This should have clued me in that this device was not going to last, and sure enough another month or so later it became unusable.

"This is one of the most adorable iphone cases I have had yet. I'm a huge fan of anything with rhinestones, but the only complaint I have is that the color looks slightly off. I thought I was ordring more of a soft pink(think towards the peach family) but I ended up with a real pink instead. Either way, I still love this case. The one common fault I see that others are having is that the rhinestones are falling off. I learned a SIMPLE trick that will help a great deal: when you first get your case, use CLEAR nail polish and paint over the rhinestones. With this case, I ONLY painted over the rhinestones on the bow itself and the surrounding top area (I DID NOT paint the individual rhinestones because I'm afraid I'd get sloppy). I do this with most of the blinged out iphone cases that I've owned, and the ones that I did not do this to are noticeably different.

"I was a bit nervous when I ordered this case since there were no reviews. Cimo had a similar hybrid with frost clear back. Supcase had a similar product too, but the back was clear. So I took a chance. This is a very attractive case on the One. The black trim on Silver back provides a nice contrast. There are cutouts for everything except the volume buttons. I tested the volume buttons first since some cases make it difficult to press the buttons. No so with this case. Very easy to press. The cutout for the rear facing mic leaves plenty of room between the mic and cutout (the mic is perfectly centered within the cutout). The bottom mic is a bit off-center within the bottom cutout, but it's far enough from the material. Cutouts for LED and rear facing camera match the pics that accompany the product description. Cutouts for power/IR and headphone jack are centered. Case is very snug (I like that). Bumper provides a nice grip since it is textured. There is a good sized lip on the case that will protect the screen when placed faced down on a flat surface. Once concern with other brands is that the hard material sometimes separates from the TPU material. I'll update the review in a few months after I use this case for awhile. This case replaces a Cruzerlite Bugdroid Circuit ""Clear"" case... mainly because the Cruzerlite's idea of ""clear"" is actually frosted white. And it cost $12.90. Overall, this BoxWave is great case for $5.70 that was Prime eligible. ******************* UPDATE: 2013-09-28 ******************* I bought 2 of these cases since we have 2 HTC Ones in the family.

"I've had this phone for a couple of weeks now & I've found it has a lot of good points, but coming from someone who's used to Motorolas, I've been missing quite a few things with this phone. First, it does have the 3G network which is amazing for super fast web browsing. I can't imagine going back to the old way. Everything loads within seconds. I love that you can rotate the camera, but that can be a nuisance if it was pointing one way & then you need to reverse the image to change it for later pictures. I was disppointed with the quality of the pictures though. I had better pics w/the Razr. I took a few pictures & sent them to a friend & he was only able to see 1. This phone has a lot of great options, but you have to pay for nearly all of them. For example, to watch tv clips from channels like TLC & Animal Planet, you need to pay $10/month; for HBO it's $5/mo. And those are only few minute clips-- not a whole show. For the radio it's another montly charge. You could easily rack up a bill for hundreds of dollars a month just to utilize all of these features on top of paying a regular phone bill. The ringtones were a big disappointment. Unlike the Razr where you can apply different rings to different things (i.e. vibrate for texts, ring for calls, etc), there is no way to have vibrate only. You can only do it before ringing or while ringing (or just plain silent) & if you have it silent, it's silent for everything--calls, texts, etc. The ringtones provided were awful. Before I got it, I checked out the other reviews & saw people wrote this too. I figured how bad could they really be?? They're bad. Bad! There's only one that actually sounds like a phone (it's called old ring) but even that's just ok. THe others are like weird, annoying songs. Very odd. I noticed the battery life is so so. I charge it about every other day & I don't even use the phone that much. If I were to make calls or use the internet, I'd have to charge it every night. I haven't gotten any dropped calls or weird variances in volume although I have found myself often straining to hear what the other person is saying. However, I've not found the calls to start out loud & gradually get lower as someone else mentioned. It's nice to be able to change the internal & external displays. You can have one image for the inside screen & another for the outside. They only provide you with 3 or so wallpapers (no screensavers) but you can use your own anyway. The screen goes black pretty quickly if you're not doing something every second. First the key lights go off & then the screen dims then goes black pretty quickly. I find that a little annoying. Storing numbers was a hassle as well. I liked the way the Razr worked in terms of this a lot better. It would show you distinguishable icons next to the person's name so you could just see what device you wanted right away. This one works a little differently & it's not as easily noticeable. All in all I think this isn't such a bad phone. I'm most likely going to get the Apple iphone when it comes out in June so just to use this phone for 3-4 months is fine. I'm sure I'll be over it by then anyway. If you don't need a ton of bells & whistles, then I'm sure you'll be happy with this phone.",neutral,neutral,0.10959830412042908,0.8146631586670438,0.07573853721252724

"This was a Christmas gift for my wife - her first bluetooth hands free headset. Very small, very sleek, very stylish - all the things an Italian woman craves - form over function. I liked the fact that it has ""military"" technology regarding noise cancellation. However, it is so tiny that the fit is diffucult for her to adjust, and the tiny little white rubber nub must be touching your cheek (or jawbone, hence the name) in order for it to have really good voice quality and to take full advantage of the noise cancelling abilities. Also, due to its sleek design, it only has two buttons that are ""hidden"" that must control all functions. This makes for a stylish cool look, but tricky to operate (although after a while with repeated use you'll get used to it). My advice: Buy this headset - but buy it with a good return policy just in case you find it too difficult to use. If you love style and techie things, and you will use this all day every day, then you'll probably like the product. Just make sure you buy it from a store that will allow returns/exchanges just in case it's not your fit. We also looked at the top of the line Plantronics headset, which came with a tiny little carrying case that had a built in battery for recharging. So you could carry it in your purse and the headset could recharge - very nice portable feature that this Jawbone does not offer.",positive,positive,0.04294467012615783,0.06966484119552828,0.8873904886783138
"My stock battery was really becoming a nuisance. It wasn't even lasting two hours.

"When I first read a review of this product online, I was quite impressed...finally, an iPod mount that would work. When I received it and put it together, I was disappointed. Allow me to elaborate...Griffin has a good idea here; instead of a goose-neck, it uses a ball-and-socket joint-type system of arms to position your iPod touch/iPhone. The problem here is that you have a limited amount of positions to put your iPod in. Second, the suction cup is not as strong as it needs to be; it's a good idea on paper (instead of a snap-down toggle like most mounts, it's a screw-down type that should hold the suction cup more securely to the windshield), but the suction cup is very difficult to get to stick to the windshield, and you have to really press hard against it while screwing it down, and even then it would detach from my windshield at the worst possible moment (driving down the Garden State Parkway at 70 miles an hour). Third, it will not work with iPods/iPhones in cases...I don't want to have to remove my iTouch from its case every time I want to take it on the road. Griffin has a decent product here that just has a few problems that prevent it from being a great one. If they address the suction-cup issue, and make a mount that allows for holding an iPod in a case, this would be a much better product.",neutral,neutral,0.09576113228946051,0.8951588166700711,0.009080051040468332
"This phone was troublesome in that it does not hold a charge as long as the previous version. I have to charge it every night. I have also experienced some dropped calls. The predictive texting is also annoying and time-consuming. If you click on the letter 'A', you may find that it puts you at several letters beyond 'A' and you have to arrow over to the 'A' and select it. You then have to fight multiple options of predictive texting and select each letter at a time among many, by arrowing over to get the predictive text that is pertinent. I have been unable to find out how to turn off the predictive texting because the manual does not mention doing that. On top of that, this phone's keypad lettering is in Russian letters in a very small font, with the English lettering below, and very hard to read in such small print. It takes forever to send a simple 6-word text.

"I traded in a Nokia phone for the KRZR a few weeks ago. The KRZR doesn't drop as many calls as the Nokia, but in the areas where the Nokia typically dropped calls, the sound quality on the KRZR is terrible. At least it's better than having the call dropped. The KRZR synchronized over bluetooth using iSync on my Macintosh without any trouble at all, so I was happy about that. I also bought a 2Gb SD card for it which I was able to load songs onto over bluetooth so I didn't need to buy a USB cable or SD reader. The Nokia had a nice feature where I could set the phone to beep once when it rang. This was good in meetings. Haven't figured out how to make this work on the KRZR yet. This phone is advertised as an MP3 player, but the adapter to connect regular headphones to it is not included. I see that I can order it from Amazon for abou $5, but none of the cingular stores I've gone to have it. A slightly annoying thing about the phone is that no games come with it. Or I should say, all the games are just trial versions which let you play for a minute and then ask you to buy the upgrade. I don't have a data plan with Cingular, so I have no idea how much it would actually cost to download games or music from Cingular since I believe you pay buy the byte when you don't have a plan.",neutral,positive,0.19150597588658672,0.35152639692390564,0.4569676271895076

"I ordered for rather silly reasons: the price and the color. The red headset matches my red Palm Treo perfectly. And the fact that it sells for under 50 bucks is nothing to sneeze at. But despite ordering it for all the wrong reasons, it works well. However, I do have some words of caution. First, it is so small that there is the danger of losing it which I almost did on more than one occasion. The fix to that is to make sure the headset in your ear snugly. Second, it shuts off after you charge it and you seem to have to hit the ""on"" button just right to turn it back on which is frustrating. Third, if you have a Palm, you have to re-pair it every time you turn the headset back on, which is annoying. Fourth, the sound quality is not the same as if you were speaking directly into the phone which is probably the same for all headsets, but there is no buzzing or static that is experienced with other headsets. A great thing about this headset is the range. I was using it the other day in the house and forgot to take the phone with me to the other room!

"I replaced a high-end previous generation nokia with this phone based primarily on its small size. The good: *Size. This phone fits easily in my pocket. I had a tiny nokia and this phone was the only flip phone at the Cingular store that was nearly as narrow. *Signal. I find the signal coverage to be slightly better on this phone than my nokia (despite cingular's advice to the contrary). *Battery life. I go a few days between charges. The phone seems to charge quickly, too. *Usability. I thought it would take time to get used to something other than my nokia but the menus were easy to use. The OK: *Camera. The camera is not great in low light, but is fine overall. One annoyance is the camera can be turned on using an external button. I've taken the occasional picture of my pocket. Also, you can't seem to get rid of the camera's shutter sound (I haven't looked that hard, but it wasn't obvious). *Sound quality. I think sound quality is lower on this phone than on my old nokia. I can hear people fine, but there is a little bit of distortion, like you might hear if you turned your stereo up too loud. It seems to help to keep the volume down a little and/or to tilt the phone slightly away from my ear. Like most phones there are volume buttons on the side of the phone so its easy to adjust. *Customization. I don't feel like I have as much control over ringing patterns, displays, etc. as I did on my nokia. Still, those are the kinds of things you get used to. The bad: There are really no deal-breakers for me on this phone. So far its been a good deal. Overall a very capable phone.

"This inexpensive little ""Switcheasy"" clip looked like a promising solution to holding the Nike plus sensor onto your shoe if, like me, you prefer running shoes other than Nikes with the built-in sensor pocket (I am a big fan of Asics Gel Kayanos). In fact, I bought two ""clear"" clips. I have a different pouch that laces onto my shoes, but it's hard to remove since you've got to unlace the shoe completely, so I thought this clip would give me an easy way to change between walking, running, hiking shoes etc. It IS very easy to switch. The problem is, it's too easy: it falls off. A lot. I read the directions and carefully tried to ""lock"" it onto my laces. But I lost two separate sensors...one while walking in my neighborhood and the other while on a cruise ship deck. I was always picking it up after it fell off around the house or on the street. I do walk a mile or two almost daily, but I'm hardly a ""power user""...I don't run much and I'm not hiking in the backwoods. THe clips are not expensive, but the Nike plus sensors in the sport kit or with the new Nike plus sportsband aren't cheap. It just doesn't make sense to use this clip and risk losing the sensor. The best choice: the velcro-driven Marware sportsuit sensor case, currently on Amazon at $9.99. Velcros right onto your shoe laces. Easy, secure. And no, I don't work for Marware. There is always some slight accuracy loss with all these clips, but they make so much sense because they allow flexibility with your workout shoe purchase AND what particular shoes you want to wear that day -- especially important if you wear waterproof/cleat walking shoes in the rain and ice.",negative,positive,0.041826696982377634,0.3030481715458029,0.6551251314718195

It does what it is advertised to do, but my experience with it only produced marginal improvements. So why the 4+ star review? Well, if you're in an area where you have only 1 bar and you get an additional bar, that could mean the difference between a call staying connected and a dropped call. Also, the booster (I'm no electrical engineer) seems to smooth out the signal (so whatever bars you have are also more consistent (? Again, I'm no engineer). Other reviewers noted an increase in data speed, but that's something I have yet to notice.

Installation is straight-forward and really quite simple: exterior antenna on roof (magnetic mount), antenna cable routed into car to booster cradle, DC adapter in power port, power cable to booster cradle.

As far as performance, I'm not sure I'm really seeing it.

At this point, if it works as well as Wilson products have for me in the past, I pretty sure I won't be disappointed.

Wilson manufactured the cradle up to its usual high standards and it looks good, so I'm very pleased there as well. The DC power adapter feels a bit cheesy, but that's really me being picky (btw, the DC adapter uses a non-standard USB cable to connect to the cradle which seems a bit strange, but it works). The adhesive tape dash mount option is not what I would choose to use, but is easily remedied (and probably with some items many of you already have from other installs). The antenna is a stubby one that attaches to the roof via magnet. If this is insufficient (e.g., you need more range) Wilson offers other antennas (such as their larger bumper- or mirror-mounted antennas). All in all, pretty happy. Sorry I can't provide more precise performance details. Other reviewers seem to be pleased with that aspect.

"Some positives - some important negatives: I purchased this because I wanted to be able to hear callers clearly and loudly. This headset is both crystal clear and the volume is excellent. On past cell phones, I max out the volume and it is still not enough. With this headset I have never maxed out the volume. I drive a loud two seat car, and even in that environment, I hear callers fine - with room the increase the volume is required (which I have not required). The unit fits comfortably in and on my ear. Negatives: EVERY caller complains about background noise - and I do not mean car/road noise. I can be sitting still at my desk and if I move around paper - people wonder what I am doing as the background noise it picks up is very annoying to them. As far as actually using in the car - any car - I can not. While I hear people well, they all get frustrated and say it is too hard to talk with me while driving due to background noise. The unit fits comfy - but it is a pain to put on. Definitely requires two hands - and if you twist the piece that goes over your ear the wrong way - you have to look at it to correct it which is not great for a hands free item (or fiddle with it a few times, which causes your call to go to voice mail or your caller to wait.... wait...). Don't bother using the button to connect/disconnect - the time required to press it is long. And if you hold it too long - you disconnect the bluetooth connection.

It does its job as a extender for the IPhone/ipad otterbox/griffen case. However the audio quality is very bad. You can't hear lead guitars on most songs/backup vocals only rhythm guitar and lead vocals. Also for music that has vocals overlaying an computerized beat/percussion/sounds its really soft.

No matter how long I left these on the charger, they would never indicate that the battery was fully charged. I could leave it on the charger for 2 days and it would never say charge complete. So, I sent them back and ordered the Motorola Karma. All in all, if you can get a phone without that problem with the charging circuit, it is a nice phone. I wish LG would get their act together in the Quality Control department.

"I spent about 4 hours doing online research on which BT headset to get my wife for her cell phone (Motorola SLVR L7c) She wanted something cool looking and had already expressed interest in the H500, but I wanted to double check and make sure there wasn't anything better for around the same price. So after a few hours of reading reviews on a dozen or so different headsets, I finally decided just to settle for the H500, I was really interested in some of the Plantronics sets, but she didn't care for the design.. I was a little worried about the H500 because the reviews are kinda so-so.. They're either good reviews or bad reviews. I got it for her so she wouldn't have to fumble around in the car with a phone so how it performs in a vehicle was going to be the make or break point with it. I'm pleased to say that the headset performs way better than I expected it to. Getting started is a breeze. All you have to do is charge the headset for about 2 hours (the LED light will go off once the battery is charged) once it's done charging you have to pair it up with your phone. All you do is press and hold the call button until the LED light stops blinking and stays lit, then you have your phone set to hands free mode and follow the simple steps on the phone (For us it was as simple as the phone finding the H500 and entering the 4-digit pin of 0000) The phone saved the settings and we were all set. Using the headset is no brainer basically. There 3 buttons; Main call/multi button & Volume up & down buttons. Pressing these buttons in various combos will yield different results like mute, hold, transfer, 3-way, etc. The retail package comes with a handy fold out that has all the functions and how to access them. The build quality of the headset is great as well.. The headset is about 2 inches from earclip to mic. Its very small and very comfortable to wear. The ear clip is removable to you can use it on either ear as well. The buttons feel solid as well. Now to the actual sound quality. The headset has performed great in all the scenarios we've tried so far.. Which has been in the house while watching TV, In the car with the stereo & windows up & down & in an office environment. I was most impressed with how it performed while driving, There is no static or any background noise at all and even with the radio and window down, the user can clearly be heard both ways. Again very impressive. The only environment we haven't really tried yet was at the store. I will update once I've tested that as well. I can't really comment on the battery life yet, because we've only had the unit for a day or so, but so far the unit has yet needed to be charged. So to summarize, great headset overall, feels & looks great, sound quality is super, voices are loud and clear. Performance in the car, home & office was excellent and the price Amazon offers is great compared to retail. I'm very very satisfied (and relieved!) that this unit performs as well as it does.",positive,positive,0.0020313263880537818,0.01616533046918782,0.9818033431427583

"I bought this to install in my ski boat to inflate tubes. Unlike the picture, this is NOT a single molded device. It comes in several pieces. A flat mounting panel, a cylindrical receptacle, a plastic cover with tether, and a plastic nut. As a result of the stack-up, it does not end up flush on the mounting surface unless you cut a much larger hole than would be required for just the diameter of the receptacle. On the one I received, the mounting panel was not molded properly; there is only a very tiny edge (.025"") of plastic holding the nut on the bottom. I imagine that a strong tug upward on a plugged in device might break that edge. The attaching hole in the plastic tether is too small to nicely fit over the receptacle; you can stretch it to fit but I suspect it will tear in a few years.

This works as expected and is no different from any other bluetooth headset. I've used this headset with my Motorola RAZR and Uniden landline bluetooth-capable phone. COMFORT/DESIGN The H350 has an earclip that easily pops off so that you can fit the headset onto either ear. The clip itself is flexible rubber and while it seems moderately comfortable at first, I find my ear starts to hurt after about 30 minutes. Ideally, I do not want to notice or feel that I'm wearing a headset. I definitely cannot say that about the H350. The speaker lightly rests over your ear canal. There are two volume buttons on the top and bottom of the headset to increase, decrease, or mute the speaker. SOUND QUALITY I've tried quite a few headsets out there from Plantronics, Motorola and Jabra to compare. Most of them have some deficiencies, and the H350 is no different. People on the other end of my conversations state that while my voice is clear, it sounds a little ""far-away."" I also think that the highest volume ability of the H350 speaker on my end is still too weak (yes, I have perfectly normal hearing). When you max out the speaker volume the sound becomes a bit distorted and it's still not loud enough to clearly hear the other caller while driving in a car, even with the windows all the way up. This is in stark contrast to the Plantronics 640-665 series which have jelly earpieces that comfortably squish into your ear canal for optimal volume and clarity. As a result, I can only recommend the H350 for home use where there isn't alot of background noise present. OVERALL At it's basic level, the Motorola H350 bluetooth headset works. You maintain a good connection between it and your phone within 10-12 feet (like any other functional headset). However, it's shortcomings in volume and mic quality cannot be overlooked. I only recommend this headset if you plan on using it at home or in the office, and only if you got it for a great price. If you need higher quality, you may want to open your wallet a little more and look into that Plantronics 640-665 line.",neutral,neutral,0.06366482350575661,0.8834895437463269,0.052845632747916545

"I didn't know much about GPS systems when I decided to buy this unit (my husband is the electronic guru in my house). I only knew I was sick of printing up mapquest directions when I needed to go somewhere as I got lost easily. I needed something simple to use that I could use in the car to navigate where I was to go. This Garmin 200 is perfect! The best and most easy to use basic GPS unit out there. If you're looking for something that is easy to use, this is it! It's basic, meaning that it doesn't have all the bells and whistles of the more pricey versions (no bluetooth, doesn't say street names, no text to speech, no FM option) but don't let that discourage you at all! It does the job JUST AS WELL as the expensive versions without all the junk you won't use. The only thing I would have liked more was if it said street names, but it's not necessary. It talks to me and tells me when I need to turn and I can visibly see the street name on the screen well enough. I have very few cons... my personal preferences really, but here they are: 1) only one voice, female. 2) No case. You have to buy one seperatly if you plan on not getting this dinged up in your purse/bag. 3) No A/C adaptor. Again, you must buy this seperate. Overall I gave this 5 stars because it was ready to use after I charged it, easy to figure out and most importantly... gets me to where I need to go. I live in a RURAL area of OK and it has back roads on the map I didn't even know about! You won't be disappointed! I am a wife and mother of 3... this is perfect and user friendly for all elctronic weary women like myself.

I have been using one of these for over a year. It is comfortable and fits very well. (much better than my other Jabra JX-10 unit) The shape of the ear insert helps the unit stay put when I am active. The small sponge over the mic blocks the wind and people can hear me very clearly on windy days. It works great in the rain with my phone safely tucked away. The ear loop quickly flips over and the unit can be used in the other ear. The included neck strap is convenient and I use it for my work ID as well.

"Be warned, this item is actually being sold by Tiger Direct. Mine looked like a refurbished unit and it was branded T-Mobile. The status on the order showed it was shipped on December 30th, but the tracking number (eventually) showed it was not really shipped until January 6th. When you put this item in your shopping cart, Amazon will probably recommend that you also purchase a CD with Motorola phone tools and a USB cable. I took their recommendation but that didn't work out very well for me. One of the selections on the phone tools software is labeled 'Update phone software'. That sounds like a good idea and harmless enough doesn't it? Unfortunately, if you select that item, your phone software will be updated to the latest version, but your phone will now be relocked and won't work until you enter a 'Subsidy code'. Tiger Direct phone support (9 - 5 PST Mon - Fri) is a good way to waste 20-30 minutes on hold (my average hold time). Eventually, they told me to email the IMEI number from the phone. After emailing TD the IMEI number and a few days waiting, they informed me they were not able to give me the code and I would have to return the phone (at my expense) for a replacement. Luckily, the Amazon guarantee allowed me to return it for a refund instead. I still have to pay the return shipping but at this point, I'm happy to be able to do that.

"The Motorola H700 headset is a decent piece of equipment, but I have a few issues with it still: 1) The battery is always dead! Why? Because of the fact that this device does not have any sort of neck lanyard (like the HS850), you have a tendancy to carry it in your pocket, purse, bag, etc. When you do this, it is very easy for the ""call button"" on the side to become slightly depressed. When this happens, the battery drains quickly. So, in order not to have your battery die, place the H700 in a location where NOTHING will touch it when not in use (i.e., when not on your head); 2) when answering a call on my Motorola V551 phone, if I try to transfer the call to my H700 headset after using the phone's handset, it doesn't work; the voice on the other end disappears--the H700 only works when I initiate a call with the headset on.

"Motorola razr pouch. This pouch looks good, feels good, fits the phone nicely, and removing the phone for a call is easy. It seems well-crafted of nice leather. A couple of drawbacks would make me think twice about buying another. 1. Adhesive that I suppose bonds the leather lining to the outer leather came off on the camera lens of my phone. Difficult to clean off. 2. The clip which holds the pouch on your belt is very tight--a good thing--but that makes the stitching on the leather covering the metal clip come loose after a couple of weeks of use--a bad thing.

"Griffin's new case for the iPhone is supposed to be a twofer; a hard plastic case and an internal antenna that improves cell phone reception. How does it perform? The ClearBoost case is a two-piece (top and bottom) case that snaps together, encasing the iPhone snugly within. There's never a worry about the iPhone sliding out of the case, as can happen with slot-loading cases, as the two halves snap tightly together. In fact, you need a small screwdriver or a quarter to pop the two halves apart. However, the hard plastic case material, while tough, is slippery. I was immediately struck by how smooth the case was; there was no sense of tackiness or grippiness to the material. I used the ClearBoost for a couple of days, and had it accidentally slip out of my hands more than once. Also, there is no belt clip, so the iPhone will have to live in your pocket or purse. The main selling point of the ClearBoost case is improved cell phone reception. That's the ""boost"" in ClearBoost. Inside the bottom case is an unpowered antenna that sits firmly against the back of the iPhone outer shell when closed. I'm not enough of an electrical engineer to know how the induction works to transfer the signal from the ClearBoost's antenna to the iPhone, but Griffin says there is a marked improvement. Part of the review package is a white paper telling reviewers how to access the iPhone's Field Test Mode to measure the cell tower signal strength. I tapped in the code (*3001#12345#*) and went to Cell Information. I live a bowl-like depression in the foothills of the Catalina Mountains, in the northern part of Tucson, AZ. ATT's cell phone coverage is usable, but just barely. The reported signal strength without the case was barely within what Griffin calls ""usable."" Oddly, the audio quality is fairly good, and ATT coverage is better than Sprint, my previous carrier. I first noted the signal strengths without the ClearBoost from the five towers (uniformly poor), and then strapped the iPhone into the 'Boost. Hmmm, the signal strengths were almost identical, and the apparent call quality was unchanged. I went back to the reviewers guide, and found that other data from the towers showed that, in my location, ATT was using the 1900 mHz band. Unfortunately, the ClearBoost antenna is designed to work best with the 850 mHz band. It may have some small improvements for 1900 mHz signal, but not much compared to 850 mHz signals. Griffin says that ATT uses the 850 mHz band in most parts of the US. But Tucson appears to be all 1900 mHz. I tried the ClearBoost at Nemo's house, about five miles due west of my location, only to find that his area uses the 1900 mHz band, as well. I spent twenty minutes on the ATT web site, trying to discover what parts of the US use 850 or 1900 mHz, and could not find any information. I suspect it's there, but I couldn't dig it up. Is the ClearBoost right for you? I'm not really able to comment on how well the antenna works in the 850 mHz band, so I can't say yea or nay. Antenna performance aside, the case is too slippery, and needs a belt clip. MyMac.rating 2.5 based mostly on the case's slipperiness.",negative,neutral,0.13469660040804332,0.8289376112394522,0.036365788352504445

"Great phone holder. I use it for my MyTouch 4G phone and it slides nicely in and out and the fastener holds it quite securely. It will also fit with my rubber phone cover on it too, but the tackiness of the rubber requires you to give it a good pull to take it out.

"I work for a company that sells refurbished phones and cell accessories and this particular item is a huge bestseller. The other day we got about 1,000 of these in and within 24 hrs, all but 2 were sold. We got more in and they also sold out. Recently, my father wanted one and my boss gave it to him as a gift and at $90 in the store, it was very generous of him to do so. My dad loves this though. He likes that it's not cheap and fits comfortably on his ear. We have since gotten Blue Ant's other models and while they aren't selling as quickly as this one, they are still a hot item but the VX1 gets my vote for it's pretty design (I like the ant picture) and for being small.

"First off, it works well. It is a solid, well-made piece that does it's job of charging the phone. It is easy to place the phone in and hard to tip the phone over once in the dock. Unlike some of the other reviewers, the unit I received was definitely silver and not pink. However, I decided to place this dock on the nightstand next to my bed at night as I'm sure many others plan to do. Unfortunately, the blackberry insignia on the dock shines an extremely bright white light. There is also no way to turn it off and it ends up illuminating the entire room. It is even lit up when the phone is not on the charging unit. For anyone planning on using this in another room rather than where they sleep or who have no problem sleeping with light in the room, it's a great device.

"I recently dropped my land line and went 100% wireless for telephone service; with this change, I wanted to make sure I didn't suffer from numb arm talking on the smaller cell phone for longer periods and wanted to use a hands-free approach. My previous experiences with that were not very satisfying back in the day of earbuds and dangling wires. But, with a new cellphone came Bluetooth wireless capability, which opened up a new world of options. I had played with a number in the store, but didn't get any real world experience with them. But, I really liked the design and feel of the H700. I did some research - much of it through reviews here on Amazon; this left me a bit skeptical as there were many unfavorable reviews written here - they mentioned negatives like poor sound quality, minimum range, and Bluetooth connective problems to name a few. But, I decided to side with some other review I had read and the positive reviews on Amazon. The bottom line is I am very happy with my H700. I have experienced absolutely no problems - the people I have talked to all can hear me fine, and I can hear them; I have had the H700 up to 7 feet from my phone with no reception problems; and the H700 was easy to setup with my phone (LG VX8300) and immediately connects whenever I turn the device on. Feature-wise, the H700 is great! The buttons are easy to use and understand and the flip mic is great idea...the phone rings, just flip it open (keep it closed to conserve power) and the call is answered immediately; flip it closed to end the call and it powers down as well. The H700 also features a button for answering and ending calls if you don't want to power down the unit.

"I've had this for two months, and while it is decent basic headset, there are major flaws. For reference's sake, I have this paired with a new Motorola L6 I got in May. The main power button is at best unreliable, and after reading reviews elsewhere I have come to the conclusion that this wasn't a faulty unit, it is endemic to the line--the power button is just faulty, twitchy, unreliable, whatever you want to call it. Additionally, I thought the AAA battery thing would be a great idea. Instead I've noticed that not only does the battery not last as long as advertised (assuming it's the battery and not the power button, which is not fun to determine), within six months of even theoretical normal usage the value over a charger solution vanishes. Batteries are expensive over time! In the end, you really do get what you pay for. The H300 is certainly cheap. But it also works like a cheap headset.

"After two major dissapointments with Seidio's ""skin and holster"" product not fitting my 8330 correctly, I decided to try Otterbox for the first time. THEY GOT IT RIGHT! Otterbox calls this unit ""Semi-Rugged"". They are too modest!!! The aptly named Defender not only fit my BB like a well-worn glove, it offers protection elements that Seidio ignores. Every part of the device is covered and protected with the exception of the trackball and microphone. I wouldn't have it any other way. Even the keyboard is protected by a very accurately formed clear cover. Pros - Superior fit and protection. Lightweight and stylish. Sleeper feature is a must for a BB to maintain life of the battery. Adds a little bulk to the device, but the protection factors are well worth it! Cons - Vibration feature of the BB is dampened severely. A little pricey, but compared to the damage I've done to past BB devices, the investment will no doubt extend the life of the unit and save me money in the long run. Bottom line - I'd do it again in a heartbeat! All things considered, this is the best buy out there. Don't like the yellow? Get the all black version instead.

"I received this product as a gift ordered from Amazon.com. I was pleased for the most part with the features and analog sound quality. Since the A2DP profile is not available for many devices yet, I cannot make use of the Bluetooth stereo connectivity that this phone allows. I have an LG VX8100 by Verizon, which is a great phone. I just wish I could find a great binaural bluetooth headset/headphone that works completely in stereo or at least provides a 3.5 mm to 2.5 mm adapter that would allow me to listen to the mp3s on my phone through the headset. I would have been able to live with the few limitations of the device until I realized that there is a design flaw that will no doubt affect anyone who purchases this headset. I noticed a hairline fracture on one side of the headset after less than two months of careful use. The single fracture became a dual fracture on the same side and I realized I needed to return them for a replacement. I figured this was a design flaw but I liked them enough to try another pair. Lo and behold, the same thing has started to happen again. I cannot give an otherwise very good product a formidable rating when there was so little emphasis placed on the design and durability factor of a headset that costs over $100.

"The concept of this Bluetooth earpiece is fantastic. However, I have returned this earphone and would not accept it for free. The package comes with multiple ear loops and ear pieces. This is a nice gesture on the part of Jawbone. I could not get the earpiece to fit properly against my face. This is crucial for the noise cancellation to work. Worse off, if you wear glasses or sunglasses, you will be completely frustrated at any adjustment you make to your specs as this will make the earpiece move out of place. This said, the noise cancellation will not be able to function properly. The sound is tinny at best. It is difficult to make out who is calling by voice alone. I did find that when I could get the earpiece to fit, the noise cancellation worked rather well. However, the louder the background noise, the more your voice to your caller sounds synthesized and will occasionally break up. The `talk' button is very sensitive. Any attempt to re-adjust your earpiece during a call in progress easily disconnects your call. This I found to be the most annoying issue with the Jawbone. For the noise cancellation, you have no idea if it is on or off until the other end states that they are hearing a lot of background noise. For the iPhone, which I know of, you have to answer the call using the Jawbone in order for the audio to come through the earpiece.

"My wife and I both purchased the BT350 on suggestion from a Verizon rep with our new phones. She got a Treo650 and I got the LG8100. Pairing the device was relatively easy, once you followed the written instructions. However, we've both had problems with the headset staying paired with our phones on a couple of occassions, and have to run the pair-up process again. When they work, the sound is pretty good. But most of the time, they don't work very well at all. And for the record, typicall my headset is with 3-4 feet of my phone - and I've had the same problems when it's less than 2 feet away with perfect line of sight. My wife and I almost never can call each other using our headsets and connect on the first try. Oh, it will call and we'll try to answer, and it will sound loud and usually clear - but one of us can't hear the other 99% of the time - at all. It's a series of ""hello-hello? HELLO?"" Forcing us to hangup and call again. Then we usually are connected. When we do connect, the sound typically has some static, minor digital echoing, and/or frequent dropouts such that you can't hear what the other party is saying. It's very annoying - almost like when you try to fake that your getting bad reception on your cell phone an...it...sou...ds..li..is. The one button feature is ok once you figure out what the various presses on it do. I've never had to adjust the volume buttons, but they are basically up and down. More annoying is the continuously strobing blue LED on the main button. When the headset is powered on, the button flashes. When you are actually using the headset (connected to a call) the button flashes faster. This confuses people when you are wearing it - because it appears to them that you must be using it since it's flashing. But it's always flashing! So if you are a person who uses it a lot and doesn't take it off very often, that can cause a problem. Even MORE of a problem is driving with it at night. For a week, I drove home in the dark with my headset, and found myself constantly turning my head to look for emergency vehicles as I kept seeing this blue strobe out of the corner of my eye. But of course when I turned my head, it was gone. I finally figured out it was the reflection of my headsets indicator light reflecting off the windows! That can't be good. On the plus side - it is very lightweight and easy to wear on either ear. It comes with an AC and a USB charger - which was great since I could charge it at work or with my laptop. It seems to hold a charge very well for long periods. I know I've gone an entire week without recharging. The range seem pretty good - though I usually never get beyond a few feet from my phone. Even though I can't take this headset back, I'm purchasing another one because this one is pretty much useless if the intent of it's design is to have a simple to operate, hands-free and safe method of communicating with your cell phone. The BT350 simply doesn't meet any of those standards.",negative,positive,0.14602764753465597,0.39800193809366013,0.45597041437168395

"This charger is great as an extension to a single outlet cigarette lighter. The USB ports are very useful particularly the 2 amp one for iPads and other tablets with higher current requirements.

I used this recently on a ski trip in Vermont and radio reception was terrible as soon as I plugged this into the cigarette lighter outlet. If I disconnected it, radio reception returned to normal. There must be a switching voltage regulator in this for the USB ports that is not well shielded and is 'transmitting' RF garbage that screws up radio reception. I should add that my BMW has the antenna embedded in the rear windshield. It is possible that this charger will not interfere with antennas mounted outside the car on a fender or roof.

In addition the green and red glowed their colors at night for easy identification. Pairing (connecting to cell phone): Both units seemed to pair about the same from what we noticed.

"I've been using Plantronics Voyager 510 for the last 2 months and I couldn't be happier. When I was about to give up on the whole Not-Yet-Ready-For-The-Prime-Time-Bluetooth-Concept here comes along that little gem. Everything I hated in each and every other model just done right here. Granted, it looks weird when you look at it for the first time, in Seinfeldish kinda This Is A Complete Opposite Of Every Bluetooth Headset You Has Ever Had. How in the name will that thick ear loop fit right? But if you think about it placing heavier part of the device BEHIND your ear will ensure that it will stay put no matter what you do all day long. This is a truly comfortable construction and the first one for me that I can wear for as long as I want without fearing for my big and floppy ears to fall off. My second biggest gripe for other models is the static. Gosh it was driving me nuts to talk and listen and ask again and again thru all of the crackling and whooshing. Plantronics Voyager 510 has ZERO static, end of story. Even outside with the wind and street noise you can hear perfectly well the other party and what you tell them. Another big frustration I've came across with other headsets is when it disconnects from your phone by itself when on standby. It just doesn't happen with Voyager 510. It stays connected for all day long securely waiting for that important phone call when your hands are full with something else. And then there is a battery life. I charge it once a week just because I get tired of waiting for that tiny red light to start blinking. Granted, I don't talk THAT much, but still it's a huge advantage over the competition. Of course it has its oddities. Placement of buttons a little unorthodox to say the least. They all are very stiff especially Power button. But that's about it. This little guy is as close to my perfect Bluetooth headset as it can be. Way to go Plantronics! Pros: * Loud and clear both ways, no static! * Good fit * No disconnections with the phone on standby * Good range, pairs easily with the phone or Bluetooth dongle for PC * Used with Skype gives you cordless phone quality and convenience to move around * Excellent battery life Cons: * Buttons are stiff, Power button most of them all * No easy way to switch on the fly from one paired device to the other",positive,positive,0.03731483314303479,0.09146249069166834,0.8712226761652968

"This bluetooth is just okay for me but not worth the money paid.

You cannot fit the earpiece around your ear and the other one in your ear at the same time unless you bend the one that goes around your ear. If you bend the one that goes around your ear, you risk the chance of bending it to the point where it hurts when it's on your ear and then you can't wear it for a long period of time.

"Palm should have retained more of the features of its plain PDA OS, rather than trying to copy stupid interface features from Microsoft. Overall, NOT a great job, really. The reviews are quite unhelpful about the PDA applications. And battery standby life is about half of the 300 hrs specified in the description. I used to like the Palm OS, but... The OS now used by Palm in the Centro (and 680)is a screwed up version of what they have in their PDA's. For example, in Contacts, there is no longer a compact, single line, listing form. Instead, you must view all phone numbers for each entry on separate lines in the main listing. No choice. This means you can't see very many listings per page. Also, if you are not careful about entries, and put a word description with a phone number, you may just get a blank line. It used to be that word descriptors were just fine, as well as helpful. Blackberry has the more flexible and compact entry format that Palm used to have. Also the amount of information you can now enter for each number is more limited. Two steps backwards for Palm. Also, if you press a letter, such as ""J"" to see all the last name listings that start with ""J"", in alphabetical order, you are out of luck. It finds every bloody listing entry with a ""J"", whether it is first name or last, that you have to scroll through. This means fewer helpful listings per page. It means you can no longer enter a letter to skip that far down into the alphabetical listing, and if you enter something as specific as ""john"" to get to Johnson, you will go instead to first names listed as ""john"", assuming there are any in your contacts before Johnson. Also don't try to be cute and enter several letters such as ""jaa"" to go to the start of the ""j"" listings. The PDA will complain and not even let you scroll further down. The plain PDA OS does it sensibly and returns an alphabetical listing of last names starting with ""J"" if you entered a ""J"". And you could scroll from there all the way to Z if you so desired. One bug in the Treo 680 that has been fixed in the Centro relates to the display of contact information. Suppose you click on a contact entry for which you entered a fair amount of information. That is, more than can be displayed on one screen (Given the inefficient way information is now displayed, that is not hard). On the 680 you will not find any cursor or arrows to let you move up or down the page to see additional information. But there actually is one that is invisible in the bottom right of the screen. On the Centro, it is visible. But did Palm fix this bug in the 680? No. Owners of that model are stuck. This is expected given the general contempt Palm shows toward its customers. You will also find stupid changes in the Calendar. For example, you could on a Palm PDA hit an entry for 9am on a particular day and it would let you start an appointment with 9 am as the default entry for start time. That is, while you were viewing other appointments you could select an open time for a new appointment. Now it doesn't enter that default (on the next screen). In my view, Palm has messed things up enough you might as well use some other OS. Like what Blackberry offers, although overall their PDA/PIM seems less efficient. Oh, and customer support says this new PDA platform is exactly what Palm intended for the PDA smartphone, even though they know it is different from their PDA's. So which do they think is better? If they think so highly of the implementation on the Smartphone, why don't they change their PDA's? Palm won't say, but I think we can guess. Palm's right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing, and anyone with good judgement has long since left the Palm development group.",neutral,neutral,0.1634876234539565,0.7623679025353299,0.0741444740107134

"I have used my new H700 for about a week. First off, beware of counterfeit units: I first went with a low priced unit and found it was counterfeit when I examined it using Motorola's handbook on counterfeit models. Performance was poor (lots of static). The second purchase yielded a genuine product and the performance is much better. (HOwever, even this unit came with a European charger. I had to call the vendor to request a US version. Man, internet vendors can be a real pain!) A comment on versions: I read alot of posts that described A, B and C versions with the C version supposedly optimized for CDMA type phones. But after a few calls to Motorola (the first tech support guy had no idea there were even different versions) and some emails, I found out that the only difference between the versions is some details in the pairing procedure. All are supposed to be compatible with any Bluetooth phone - no special versions for CDMA phones, etc. Performance of the headset seems solid: good audio quality for both sides of the phone conversation. I haven't really tested the Bluetooth range but it works fine while driving with the unit on my left ear and the phone about 4 feet to my right on the passenger seat. I don't have enough use to really comment on battery life, but the charger is SLOW. It takes over two hours to get a full charge. The multi colored LED on the headset is helpful to know what the unit is doing (pairing, charge progress, etc). My biggest gripe about this model: Motorola blew it in terms of ease of use. The unit is turned on by unfolding the boom mike from the headset body, (a big improvement over older moto headsets where you need to hold down the main button for a few seconds until it recognizes that you want to toggle power). However the headset must be off your ear to flip the boom out: the boom is facing your face and the ear hook is folded closed when the unit is turned off. In my opinion, it would have been much better if the boom hinge was on the outside of the unit. Then you could wear it on your ear with the unit off to save battery power, and flip the boom out when you hear the phone ring to quickly activate the headset to take the call.

"Let me first say that I really wanted to like this headset. The features were amazing. It has a LCD for caller ID, vibrate mode, and it's pretty small. However, as much as I wanted to like this headset I couldn't overcome the discomfort of wearing it. I mean, the wrap around plastic earpiece is pretty stiff and puts quite a bit of pressure on the ear. My ear would start to hurt after 30 minutes of wearing it. I think it's also very heavy. If they could have gotten these features into a lighter package, I would have loved it. I guess I'll have to wait for the next generation from Jabbra. A couple of other issues with the headset. You get quite a bit of static if you walk away from the phone into a room. The caller won't hear it, but you do on your end. Actually most people I talk to say they hear me very clearly with this headset. Another problem is it does flop if you move your head around b/c of the weight of this thing. I read the review and figured it's not going to be a problem with me, but if I lie down and try to talk to people, it flops away from my face and people complain I sound muffled or garbled. I'm going to return this and take my chances with another headset.

"Like the other review title says... it works. I actually paid the $8 shipping on it just to get it sooner and it did get here only a couple days after it was shipped. I have redone this review many times to try to get it more accurate as I have used it more. I put a link to a video which shows how to use this. You receive a link to it when you buy this, but obviously it would be good if you could see it before you buy it (which you can, but Amazon deleted it). At least in my experience that video is not totally accurate though. You should watch it to understand how to put the battery in, but as far as the steps go... it didn't work that way for me. In the video it shows pressing a button before ever plugging it in. Well it didn't seem to work thatw ay for me the first time. But now it DOES seem to work that way. So keep moving the metal prongs around until that left button does make a light come on. Secondly, it shows that a light flashes green when it's charging. It actually flashes red for me... And I took it out after a few hours and put it in my phone and it was mostly charged, so it apparently is working... while flashing red, not green. Like someone else who wrote a review on here... I bought this because apparently a pin in the phone got bent beecause the charger for my phone would not fit snugly and it would not charge at all. I checked out reviews for cell phones and went and looked at some and none of them impress me so I figured it would be worth $11 to get this charger shipped to me and then I can decide on some new phone later if I want. Anyway put the battery in like it shows in the video. Then plug it in. One red light will automatically be on to show the power is on. If the second red light does not start flashing then press the button on the right of the charger to flip polarity. Maybe even hold it down. If it still doesn't start flashing then you probably need to mess around with how the pins are lined up against your battery and then try again. I think some of these may be slightly different also. Someone in one of the other reviews on here said there is no english on the box. Well on mine there is english, but just not good english. Also like I said it flashes red, not green. So maybe some different versions exist. The more I use this the more I don't like it, though. You can't even tell if it's really charging! The first time I charged it, it had a flashing red light. Then when finished the battery lasted 89 hours before it even lost a bar. However THEN I charged it again and left it on there for more than 24 HOURS STRAIGHT. Then I finally took it out and tried it and it had not charged AT ALL even though that same red flight flashed as if it was charging! edit: Now it charged properly again. It charges properly if you do get that light to show up before plugging ti in. So in summary, if you have no choice but to use an external battery charger, you might as well get this. But it's not the most ideal thing ever. You have to be desperate if you resort to using this. I'm going to ahve to just buy a new phone because I can't keep dealing with something which flashes as if it's charging and isn't always even really charging! And if I take the battery out to test if it's really charging then it's hard to line it back up properly so it may not be charging the next time either.",neutral,negative,0.8415800696262637,0.1546415580785808,0.00377837229515546

"The phone was rated as a new product, yet it acts like a refurbished phone. The product is of a sub-standard material and will NOT last long. The back cover protecting the battery has not been able to stay in place from the beginning and consequently must be held in place manually in order to stay put. Already - after 1 week's worth of use - the letters on the keyboard are washing out and disappearing. The keyboard is squishy upon touch and the reception and transmission is poor. The phone is cutting out and has poor reception and transmission capability and is hyper-sensitive to ANY power source or wiring within 5ft. to the point and frequently disconnects calls.

"This phone arrived and I fully charged the battery, this only gave me one day worth of battery life. I tried again with the same results, one day or less of battery life and sometimes the phone just shuts down when the battery is near the end.

Also the phone is more plasticky than I am used too with prior Motorola Razors. (Prior models maybe?) But this also makes me wonder if this is a legit Motorola product or some knock off. Adding to this impression is the fact that some of the little plastic/rubber screw covers came off within a day or two of purchase and the limited documentation that arrived with the phone.

"This is now the 7th bluetooth headset I've owned and it is far and away the best in terms of quality of call. All the others I've used will start to crackle if I put my phone in my pocket; some drop quality if I hold the phone or place any part of my body between the phone and the earpiece. Because of its size the microphone on the Samsung WEP200 is set far back on the cheek. Despite this challenge, the unit still manages to pick up my voice clearly. I receive fewer complaints from those I call. Unfortunately, the compact design appears to severely affect the battery potential. After 10 months of moderate use, the serviceable charge time of my Samsung has dropped from disappointing to worthless. If turned on but not used, the battery will last up to 22 hours. If used to make calls, the charge my last as long as 8 full minutes on a good day. This translates to a maximum of about 2 calls per charge. Often, I have to switch a call back to the phone to avoid losing power and possibly dropping the call.

It's very small the same exact size of the V180, and there's nothing but an ugly poorly made leather pouch to put the little thing in. It's a beautiful phone to look at.

"I have had my RIZR from T-Mobile for a few weeks now after switching from Verizon. I was originally considering the Nokia 5300.

The phone is easy to program and a breeze to use. The display is bright, clear and very easy to read (even without my bifocals!). So far the sound quality and reception have been outstanding. The best feature for me is the mp3 player. With my new RIZR I can transfer mp3 songs directly from my computer to my phone with a simple drag and drop (the 128 MB card is not very large, but enough for my needs). I can then select the songs to act as ringtones. Being able to assign a song/ringtone to a certain phone number is a really cool feature, at least for me. The mp3 player included with the phone is very easy to use too. My only ""minor"" gripe is the screen goes black during calls.

"These of course work like they should. They're clear and NOT matte so that's a huge plus. I'm really picky about my screen protectors and when they come precut There's always one corner that's not being reached and it just pisses me off so I prefer these bad boys because I can cut them myself. The graph on the opposite side definitely helps when cutting and makes sure you're cutting straight. If you love little project building with your hands, you're going to love putting your screen protector on. Tip: Youtube how to do it. If you don't have patience, repetitiveness, or simple eye hand coordination, you'll hate these and should look for those precut ones. Don't expect to put it on without bubbles the first time. It takes practice. I've put on about less than ten screen protectors in my life and each time I get less and less bubbles. So expect them! And you'll see that you'll get bubbles no matter the brand. And with ten screens to go through at less than a buck each, you should have plenty of practice. Sadly, the only con to these is that they don't cover my entire screen of my Evo4g. you could get away with just covering the lighted part of the screen and leave the 'home, menu, back, and find' uncovered, but I like the whole thing covered. Oh well at least they weren't expensive. five stars tip: if you have dust in there use two pieces of tape to get it out. first one on top to peel the screen off slightly, the other piece of tape, sticky side facing dust, dab, peel off, done!

But as this wasn't completely painfull, the phone got locked once a week at least, sometimes I tried to make a call and it just didn't dialed until you turned it off and on again, like a soft reset, sometimes I was using an application and it just turned off and on again without hesitate or asking, I really NOT recommend buying this equipment nor Amazon or any other online or physical store.",negative,negative,0.7785836986040274,0.12583152461061817,0.09558477678535444

"I bought this without realizing it was 3g, not 4g (LTE Verizon) compatible - of which there are no current mobile 'multi-user' booster products available for the latter - yet. A competitor claims to have a product orderable March 1, 2014 and Wilson tech says 4-6 weeks. Wilson does have a single user 'cradle' 4G LTE Verizon compatible model. But we're planning a road trip soon and wanted a multi-user unit sooner than later so everyone in the vehicle can have some broadband while we're tooling through the hills and dales. Plus the unit was on sale, about $250 instead of the near $500 list - probably in anticipation of the newer 4g units coming available. There is no doubt this signal booster will improve voice call strength and likely less drops. A test call connected quicker than expected. But I am dubious of the 3g data speed. Reason: I conducted a speed test with smartphone app using the booster - about .28 MB download. I stepped outside the car without the booster and had about .40 MB download pure phone (very disappointed but I do live in a rural area but there is cloudy/rain inclement weather tonight). I would have expected the opposite download results, and closer to 1MB download with booster. The Wilson Tech (who seemed sort of irritated on the phone to take my call), stated best circumstance would be 3g speed of 2 MB max. Whereas their upcoming 4g (LTE) unit (model 460110 I'm told) might expect 2 MB minimum and up to 20MB max. The other aspect I am a little disappointed is you need to use both in-car and outside car antennas. The outside car antenna has a pretty small magnet, and is about 12"" tall - not as sturdy or as large as I'd hope for outdoors and to obtain a better signal but maybe that is the optimal size. Now, the indoor antenna is the bigger disappointment. The manual says the phone or data card must be within about 2 feet of the indoor antenna, and the indoor antenna should be vertical - and that means using the adhesive backing on what they suggest is the driver side seat near the vehicle center passenger compartment. Not sure how long the indoor antenna would stay mounted with adhesive - the other is do I really want to have adhesive residue on (cloth) seat? So if this is a multi-cell phone booster, everyone needs to be huddled around the indoor antenna within 2' else there is no connection to the booster. Not realistic if you're a passenger and hoping for a data boost. Or how about making a phone call, the indoor antenna needs to be pasted pretty close at shoulder height. I realize there are probably cell signal FCC regulations, but a 2' distance is not realistic in today's SUVs. I tried the booster for internet data, and really did have to get within about 1' of the antenna. How did I know? I had placed the indoor antenna on the backseat floorboard during installation and started testing and wondered why I wasn't getting any signal boost reading. When purchasing the device I thought the indoor antenna was optional, but obviously not since there are both indoor and outdoor antenna booster ports. I have not tried to use my Verizon Phone 4GLTE with mobile hotspot enabled but that would probably be the booster death blow if it doesn't work. Why? Because I pay for phone tethering and the intent is I am mobile and need to use my laptop/ipad connected to my smartphone and have a stronger data signal so I can be productive for IT 24x7 on-call systems support. Unfortunately, I may have to buy the 4G LTE version once it's available for my use (mobile and backup for home residential broadband failure) and give this 3g unit to a different vehicle just for voice. The Wilson tech did say 4G is not used for voice so I guess at the minimum that's what this unit will become... later after our road trip. If possible, I'll update these comments later after mobile hotspot use, highway/rural moving phone calls and our road trip literally through the hills.",neutral,neutral,0.04597916793130408,0.9285504938950431,0.025470338173652865

"My first phone when I switched to Verizon was the Motorola SLVR L7c, horrible little phone, very little about it was positive. My prior phones have always been Samsung so I went back and have not regretted it. This little phone is cool, compact, very functional, and fun to use. I love the dual hinges and the full qwerty keyboard. Yes, the keys are rather narrow and take some getting used to, but I love the functions. Easy to use, great phone, clear calls, compatible with Acura's HandsFree bluetooth too. My only complaints, my prior Samsung (SCH A900) had a message indicator light that flashed red, this one doesn't, you gotta wake this one up by pressing and holding any one of the side keys when it's closed to see its status. The other thing, don't know if it's a Samsung flaw or Verizon's weirdness, I can't assign different ringers to blocked and unblocked calls. I could with all my other phones but could not with the 2 Verizon phones I've had. Pro's: small but easy to use full keyboard slim profile Con's: no message indicator light Verizon's need to alter their phones' factory software/displays/setting options",positive,positive,0.03389438888646032,0.07823735979766308,0.8878682513158765
I got this for my non technically inclined brother so he could get good home cell signal. I walked him through the install over the phone and he cold not get it working. Next time I visited I spent 4 hours trying to get this to work. He lives in a marginal coverage area but it seemed to always be interfering with itself. I took it home where I have ok coverage and it did boost the signal marginally. I did get it to work well once I found the direction of the nearest tower and aligned it just right. The issue then was that the supplied cable was so short the booster and repeater were interfering with each other. So I went to radio shack and got a 50' cable and put the receiver in the attic and the repeater in the basement. I got good reception as long as I was within 10' of the repeater. Useless for my brothers needs. Overall I was not impressed. But when I wanted one for 4g I got a Wilson Electronics 815126 Sleek 4G-V Cell Phone Signal Booster - Retail Packaging - Black http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003NQ5NWI/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_hst_38 Its only for a single phone or jetpack but it works great!,negative,negative,0.840006650230622,0.09578203439187835,0.06421131537749965
"I had another less expensive brand heart rate monitor/watch. I don't need all the bells and whistles that many products offer. I was attracted by the design of this watch and the name brand for quality but it falls short of the simplicity I want in a heart rate monitor/watch. It looses connection often and I can't seem to the screen to remain locked on displaying heart rate while I'm exercising. This device offers more than I need it for so it may be excellent for others but I may return it and go back to my old reliable name brand device which sells for a fraction of the cost. Oh, and a MAJOR con for me is the ridiculously bulky charger that comes with the watch. I have to charge it often and the charger is this huge clip that you have to clamp the watch in to and then plug that in to either a USB or wall.

"I bought this for my wife for the convenience of having her hands free while driving, or in the kitchen, or working in the yard. My first bluetooth was this model, but when I used it people complained that the mike picked up too much ambient noise and had a noticeable echo. Other than that one complaint, everything else worked fine. The range was as advertised as well as the talk and standby time. The battery charged quickly and lasted for several days, depending on how much I talked (of course), and it paired easily with the MOTORAZR V3m. I upgraded to the H-700 because of its noise suppression chip, but was very disappointed with it. The range was horrible, and had to deal with a lot of static.

The Samsung WEP 200 - Headset ( ear-bud ) - wireless - Bluetooth is very clear and is very small. I like it. The down fall is that you must have a direct line of sight with your cell or else you start to get static immediately. distance with direct line of sight is good. One more down fall is that it does not have noise reduction so it picks up all of the noise around you really good. I had the Motorola H700 and that was good on the noise reduction.

"When I found out Virgin Mobile was coming out with a camera phone all I could say was ""hell yea!"". Finally a camera phone on a pre-paid services plan.

The camera again is my main reason for wanting this phone and after testing it out under many different conditions it doesn't disappoint. The quality wonderful for a camera phone, and the process of sending pictures to your friends is a snap. You can send pictures either to another camera phone, to your virgin mobile online account, or directly to an e-mail address (doesn`t work with gmail, I`ve tried). One thing that pleasantly surprised me was that you can even take pictures while the phone is flipped closed and the small external screen acts as a viewfinder.

"I have only had this a week but it has performed as stated in the package and in the write ups and reviews via CNET and others. My headset is paired with my LG Dare phone via Verizon. I hate to read on how to use and get things going. Literally, you get this out of the fancy tube package, charge it which takes maybe an hour. By the way it comes with a car charger, a wall plug and a all are USB enabled. I charged mine via my computer but I could plug in the wall to charge or in the car too. Even better since it is a USB plug I can even charge my LG DARE phone which has a USB plugs as well and really makes it easy and useful. After it has been charged I put it on my ear as you are advised to do, press the button and the device speaks to me to tell me waht to do to get myself connceted to my bluetooh phone. In a matter of seconds I was connected and able to do commands. I received calls, the ear piece tells me the number calling and asks me if I was to answer or ignore and you tell it and you get your call or ignore it. My calls have been very clear and you can adjust the volume right on the headset. Even when I rec'd text messages they were read to me by the headset. For me right out of the package the ear piece and the hook that goes over your ear were pretty basically a perfecet fit. Every once and while I might have to push the each piece back in but that is no big deal and with the hook over the ear it won't fall off your ear especially if the ear piece with the silicone piece comes out of the ear. It is a very small headset, smallest I have ever used and I have big fingers and hands so it was hard for me at first but again it does it for you, tells you who is calling, you state what to do and it does it. If you have things programmed in your actual phone it can follow some of those commands as well. In this case I have not read into the booklet in order to see how that works or how to set it up. For me this will primarily be used when driving or if I had to be out and about for an extended period I would probably have this on my ear. I would never use it in the office being you are actually have a converstaion with someone on the phone so speaking allowed would be no good in my office setting. Like with anything you get through Amazon, check the return policy, usually 30 days with Amazon, sometimes 14 days for certain products. Test it out, I'm sure there are many variables as you see in other reveiws so take all that into account. For me in New York City and in NJ and NY state I have had no issues and am very pleased with this device. Oh and it does have a big blue ant which is the main button on the unit. It does flash on occassion when the unit is on. for me I don't care I think it is funny but some may not think a light/button in the shape of an ant is cool.

"One thing for sure, the service of Amazon is not what I had expected. Initially the when the order was placed, Amazon cancelled the order in about 4-5 hours, the reason gives was ""Cingular cannot process your order on the information given, since Amazon does not have the requirements that Cingular wants, we are cancelling your order"", Awww C'mon Amazon, if you cannot communicate with Cingular, I guess then you guys should not be doing business with Cingular, or there should be a statement somewhere stating that the Order can be cancelled for any reason (the prime being ""Cosmic Radiaton""). So I tried placing the order again, it was processed after about 4-5 futile attempts, and the information that was provided was the identical as the first time.

"Quality: The improvement is not as big as I originally expected, but there is a noticeable improvement in the quality of the system. For those of you that still use a Wii, if you can get a good price for this item (anything under $7.00), then I would say it's worth getting this item. It's called ""HD"", but it's still far from the HD you see on television or other systems. It still, however, sharpens the experience. Usefulness: The cable is short, so if your Wii and TV are far apart, then don't expect to be able to use this. They have to pretty much be on the same shelf. It is shorter than the original cable that comes with the system, so you may have to make adjustments to the location of your Wii and/or TV.

"I had Tmobile earlier and swtiched to verizon just bcos i was fascinated with the features this phone was offering...but once i got this phone today...i m totally displeased..The phone is BULKY..its fat and long with a longer antenna. I had v300 earlier and I thought it was thick but this thing turned out to be thicker. Silver/Black combo ..doesnt suit my taste atleast ...more or less looks similar to v600. Features are pretty decent,1.2 MP camera,mp3 player..which i haven't tested yet. As others say Bluetooth is just an exageration,thanks to Verizon. The best part is its screen,its biiiiiiiiiig, but the sad part is you(at least I) cannot press the * and # keys easily as its tooo far for your thumb. The outer screen shuts off in 5 secs ruffly..you cant even see the time as in v300 or v600. Infacct you have to press one of the buttons to see that. Verizon doesnt ship it with ANY GAMES AT ALL...I spent an hour searching for games which weren't there at all. I even tried the Motorola Mobile phone tools with the USB, sadly,even that was not able to transfer pics and ringtones in and out of phone, as was poss in v300. I seriously don't understand the problem with verizon,why it crippled it to an absolute NOTHING!. The flip opens and closes with force...ie it doesnt open up easily and smoothly.it just pushes on you( might not be a big deal but you do it for 10 mins and you minght end up injuring your thumb). I seriously doubt if it will fit in my jeans pocket..its so damn long, I only wish people don't misunderstand such a bulky thing in my pocket for something else...:-? Its a average peice,nothing awesome about it,but if you are a newbie to camera phones, this might be just for you. Think once before you buy! MOST IMP THING!!! Make sure your contract ends on your old service before porting number to the new service,or else you might end up paying a termination fee.

"I am a Cingular Blue customer, i.e. former AT&T customer rolled into Cingular billing, but with my old AT&T sim card. I bought this phone a couple weeks ago. The phone did not work out of the box with my AT&T sim card, it kept booting to a screen that asked for a password. That was a bummer, as I really wanted to keep my great AT&T calling plan. So, after a little research, I found a non-branded cell phone store (privately owned, not T-Mobile, Cingular, etc.) where they did instant unlocking for a very reasonable fee (around twenty bucks). That did it! After 5 minutes and pocket change, my phone was unlocked and worked with my AT&T sim card. And, now I can put *any* sim card in the phone, not just Cingular/AT&T. So, for example, any European or American pay-as-you-go sim will work. Very cool. As for the phone itself - I love it. I have been using cell phones since the early 90's, when minutes were measured in dollars, and this phone is the *best* phone I've had. Great size, great features, great reception. Bluetooth. Speakerphone. Highly customizable interface. MP3 ringtones. Compact. Huge, bright color screen inside, and nice color screen outside. One of the easiest to open foldable phones. For example, the seam between the two halves lets you slip a finger in to flip the phone open quite easily. I loved my old V60 years ago, but my main complaint about that was you *had* to use two hands to open it. When it was closed it was too smooth to flip open with one hand. The Razr allows one handed flip - very cool. Don't worry about the battery life warnings. My phone easily goes a couple days with regular use, and many days with just a little use. I mean, I suppose charging once every two weeks would be fun, but practically speaking just plugging it in every couple days without thinking about it works fine for me. My only real complaint is there is no headphone jack! The *only* port is a little mini-USB type B port, which is for charging, data transfer, and headphone plug. But no standard 2.5 mm plug. Of course, it has bluetooth, so any bluetooth headset will work. In fact, I use the Jabra 250v and love it. It works really well. But sometimes I like the simplicity of a *wired* headset, without having to worry about batteries, and that's the only area where the Razr stumbles. I have yet to find any way to adapt a standard 2.5 mm plug to the mini USB plug on the phone. And the only headset available with a mini USB plug built in is Motorola's, and they only offer one, which is the little dangley earpiece kind with a dongle on the wire for the mic. I really don't like those. CONCLUSION: Love the phone. Love the features. Love the reception.

"Purchased this after a lot of amazon reviews. The sound quality is as described (positives) in most of the reviews, and very happy with mine in all situations (street, wind noise, driving highway speed noise, and even in my convertible top down at city speeds). Jawbone ""Fit"" problem that most people report could have easily been corrected by treating the ear-loop as an adjustable eye-wear and hand-adjust for a good fit. I had a initial problem also -- the ear-loop wire was too close to the top of my ear and was uncomfortable to wear after a few min. Here is a simple guide. 1. Take the ear-loop off. 2. Find the ear bud that fits your ear, both comfortable and would actually hold the unit on without the ear-loop. That size would provide both the tight enough and comfortable fit. 3. Put a ear-loop on. Start adjusting the top so that there is no to little pressure to the top of your ear. I found that ear-loop sizes makes very little difference (included large, small, etc sizes are too similar to make a difference anyway). 4. Then bend the ear-loop toward to unit so that it provides support on the back -- but no need to go for a exact or tight fit. If you had used wire-frame eye-glasses, you should be familiar with this process. 5. The key steps are the #2 and #3 above. Should not take you more than a few minutes to get the comfortable enough fit you need, and forever to get that perfect fit (just like eye glasses). ======== Not related to ""fit"" problem, but Quality of my unit ==== - Update after 2+ weeks of use. - Too bad I cannot change the 5 star rating down to some lower # based on this updated experience. The fit (as adjusted above) and sound quality has been great. The Problem with my Unit: My unit shuts down randomly, almost regardless of the battery status (I have hade my unit charged near full, since I was not traveling during this period). Most often during a call, and seldom during standby. Once the unit shuts down, it behaves as if the battery has run down and would not turn back on, for up to 15 mins (did not try after that). But after an hour or two, the unit could be turns on and operates for a few more hours (and for even 1 hour conference call). So this is not clearly run-down battery problem, but something else. Now for the Aliph (the MFGR) Customer Service: Called Jawbone directly, and they insist that the problem is my phone dropping the call. Now I explained that yes, this could happen if you have the phone in your pocket, and some keys could be pressed..., but it does not explain the case when I had the phone on my desk, nor explain why the unit would not turn back on (not just dropping the call, but shutdown), yet operate properly after a ~ few hours. The Customer Service insisted that this is not a problem with their unit -- would not even recognize the logical disagreement in the evidence I provided and their explanation. This problem happened about every other day with normal business use (~ 1 hour talk, ~15~20 calls, 6+ hour standby per day). BTW, I got to a live person to talk to in less than 1 min -- fairly positive and frankly impressive when I now normally expect menus, menus and more phones menus and no live person interaction for 10~20 min. I am returning the unit for replacement -- still like the sound quality and the fit. If the replacement behaves the same way as my current unit, I will be giving up on this unit and seek alternative. ============= Quick update on replacement -- the replacement unit (new) works flawlessly. Perhaps the quality problem discussed on this forum is true for this manufacturer for now...",positive,neutral,0.39318308825391124,0.5913371413628772,0.01547977038321166

"I had the Nextel i730 for 8 months then i just couldn't take it anymore. To be honest the phone is a easy phone to get attached to. But recently i upgrade to the i850 and iam very very happy i did. The i730 is a phone / radio. The color screen is on par with all other free phones that are usually FREE. So basicly the screen is not impressive at all. The phone comes with features, but to be honest it took me about 2 months to figure out how to use all of them on,( NOT USER FRIENDLY AT ALL) and by that time i had lost faith in the phone itself. It's heavy, very heavy, and thick. On the good side, it' sorta stylish and its very durable, this is what i loved about it. I dropped the phone so many times and it has very little exterior damage. I look at this phone like, a army tank, versus my newer i850 which i just upgraded to, and thats more like a convertable BMW. The i850 is a phone that you just have to have a leather case on it, because it looks so good, that you don't wanna risk it gettings scratched, this on the other hand, there's no need to case it, because the exterior is that solid. I'm a 23 year old male out of atlanta ga. As far as reception, the calls on the i730 are very clear, the speaker phone is awesome, you can almost set the phone in one room and talk at a leisure tone on the other side of the room and the caller will hear you fine, which is cool. But to be honest i can only say this phone would fit someone who is not looking for alot bells and whistles, Not a person between the ages of 16-21, bad idea. This phone is for people who want a phone that can handle just about anything, ie construction worker. Another good thing about this phone is it'is nearly impossible to lose, due to its weight. When you have the i730 on the hip swivle thing, it feels like you've got a gun on ur hip, or a flash light, its that heavy. Plus with it being 2006 and all, this phone is getting very dated, by the end of the year this phone is going to be classified as a dinosaur. If you can get it for free, go for it, but if your paying money, trust me, dish out a few extra bucks and go with the i850, the i850 is the honest to god best cell phone ive ever owned, and ive had 15+ cells.",neutral,neutral,0.10504746250899576,0.5484489155827624,0.34650362190824174

"I had this case for 7 months now. It was great for the first few months, until I noticed slight discoloration along the leather edges (it turns blue/green) from rubbing. The leather stitching is also frayed on ALL sides. I however wore this case inside my front pocket. If you wear it like it's intended (hanging outside your pocket), it should maintain its new appearance for a long time. Because I like to wear my Blackberry Curve phone inside my pocket instead of letting it hang out like a fanny-belt, I decided to get an OEM BB slim case that usually comes with a new Curve phone.

"The speaker has pretty decent sound for its size. It supports wired (via 1/8"" TRS cable, included) or bluetooth operation. (The iPhone 3.0 OS update includes the A2DP profile for all iPhones. I've tested it with an older model iPhone, and it works perfectly well.) The speaker has a bass boost feature which I've never been compelled to use -- the bass sounds fine without it, and, to my ears, gets a bit muddy and boomy with it on. The speaker seems pretty well constructed. I have two complaints about this speaker. First, it has a very quick auto-shutoff feature. This is enabled even when the speaker is used fully wired -- plugged in to an A/C socket and receiving the audio signal by cable. This is undocumented by the company, and there's no way to bypass it. The upshot is that if you use it with your computer, it does not behave like a regular speaker. Occasional sounds -- an incoming message, an application notifying you of anything -- are never heard. Instead, the speaker just pops as it comes on, and then moments later, shuts off again. My other complaint is that, often, when used with bluetooth, the sound crackles intermittently. It doesn't matter if I have the speaker 3 inches away from my computer's bluetooth antenna, or several feet away, the crackling is the same. I've not been able to find a fix for this. Keeping the speaker is a difficult decision to make. When it works, it's lovely.

"Whenever I get a new portable device, one of the first things I do is buy a screen protector, then I have my husband apply it. When hubby got a Blackberry, I ordered these right away.

"In December 2007 I renewed my AT&T contract and got a Motorola Q9H. Yesterday (Feb 2008), when unplugging the phone from the charger, the charge socket on the phone came right out of the phone - it appears that it is held on by a small amount of solder on the junctions, and the solder joints are dull and look dry. I called my local AT&T store and they said, no problem, there is a 12 month warranty, and I need to call a 1-800 number and they will send out a replacement. So I called the number. They tell me that they will send out a replacement, and I must send in the phone, but should they determine that this is due to ""physical damage"" they will bill me $399, and there is no way to get the old phone back. I asked why I can't send the old phone in without them shipping out a new one and have them call me to tell me whether it is covered under warranty (which is should be; I did not mistreat the phone) and if not, give me a quote to have it repaired. They can't do that, they said. My only options are to decide up front to send it for repair (and pay for the repair), or gamble $399 that they will do the right thing. Obviously the phone is ""physically damaged"" but that is due to a defect, not abuse, so this doesn't sound like a good gamble to me. So I'm left with a broken phone less than 3 months old.

"Bought it for my Samsung Galaxy S II for AT&T. The phone has a micro USB port, so you need a micro USB plug to charge it. The a97 is iGO's attempt at a micro USB phone charging plug but they failed IMO. The unit shipped to me was in a small plastic bag shipped in a padded envelope. When I opened the package it was scuffed from the shipping process. This is minor and it doesn't bother me too much. However the fact that the a97 plug that I received will not stay securely in the USB port does bother me. The a97 plug fits in the phone and the phone will charge, but you have to put something up against the cable to make it stay inside the phone. I am fine with having to jerry-rig a charging cable after months of constant service. I am not fine with having to jerry-rig right out of the padded envelope... I bought this tip for $6.40 because it was half off what the local RadioShack was selling it for and it was being sold by iGO themselves via Amazon. Normally I am always satisfied with my Amazon purchases, but this time I had to learn a little $6.40 lesson. FYI: I am thinking these might be ""factory second"" tips from iGO (hence the half off price from the iGO themselves) or mine got severely bashed (more than is externally visible) during shipping Being frustrated I went ahead and bought another a97 tip from RadioShack and viola, the tips fits into the phone snugly and charges without problems... so far.",negative,negative,0.5600142105492562,0.085385018898655,0.3546007705520887

"I've used 5 or 6 of these from various manufacturers, and this Manhattan Model 433556 is the best I can find. I use them for installing combination floppy drives / memory card readers. This one is plastic, but sturdy enough to do the job. It allows a standard floppy drive to fit through the hole in the faceplate. The hole in the front is slightly over-sized, so it is also an easy flush-fit for some of the larger FDD / memory reader combination units that have a slightly over-sized form factor. These are often difficult to fit through other brands of mounting bracket face plates. So if you are looking for a flush fit at the front, this one can do it. The mounting screw holes on this one line up better than those on the Bytecc Bracket-525. They could still use a little more slotting to make it easier to do forward and aft adjustments, but overall the holes are acceptable. Also see my review of the Bytecc Bracket-525, which I consider second best. It has a slightly smaller front opening hole that fits the standard floppy drives a little tighter, but still allows them to fit flush. Mounting screw hole alignment is the main disadvantage of the Bytecc Bracket-525. On the Bytecc, they don't line up for a flush fit, and adjustment is almost impossible. The Manhattan is better. The main advantages of the Manhattan Model 433556 are the slightly larger front opening and the better, although not perfect, mounting screw hole alignment.",positive,neutral,0.005420545112922799,0.6283488598912015,0.36623059499587574

"What ever you do, DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!!! From a Long Time PALM User Let me first start by saying that I am a loyal Palm-Handspring-PalmOne-Palm user. I have owned the folowing; Palm IIIe, Palm Vx, HandSpring Visor, Handspring Visor Delux, VisorPhone (a Handspring Phone Add on), Treo 270, Treo 600, Treo 650, and am now the SAD owner of two completly useless Treo 700w's. I really was loving my GSM treo 650, but my wife wanted to upgarde to a Smartphone and was on Verizon, so that coupled with the lure of the high speed internet led to the worst $1000 purchase of our lives. It is unfortunate for Verizon and Palm that I bought two of these and was able to see that all of the crashes and problems that I was having were not isolated to my phone, becuase my wife's was doing the same exact things. It is one thing if you run into some bugs with the more advanced applications, but when you are locked into a two year contract for PHONE service, then PHONE part better at least work. On the Treo 700w it does not. Here are some of the problems with JUST the phone application in the device, I will not even need to mention the more advanced issues. 1)Horrible call quality 2)Constant dropped calls 3)Often, the phone can not swap between calls without disconnecting. 4)Can not hang up on second caller (so you have two calls going on and on and on, which I am sure verizon is charging you for those mins). 4) Phone randomly dialing calls when it is sitting uninterupted on the desk in front of you 5)Phone calls your voicemail when you dial another person. 6)Bluetooth headset disconnects EVERYTIME you walk more than 50 feet away and only a 5-10 min series of soft resets and resyncing can get them to connect again. 7)Phone rings and the ansewer screen will not come up, so you can not ansewer the call. 8)Voicemails apearing 10 mins after someone called with no indication of call arriving prior to that 9) Worst of all. The phone will somtimes appear to be working normally and I will go for an entire day without a call. Then late in the day I will try to check my email or make a call and neither will work. I do a reset and then the horror kicks in. Bing, Bing, Bing, Bing, you have 24 voicemails and 8 text messages....WHERE ARE YOU! All of our old phones rang when someone called and allowed you to ansewer and hang up on people. Is this too much to ask? In genreal I would have to say that the operating system on this phone is in ALPHA phase. It is nowhere near ready for the public market that it has found it's way too. I could also go on and on about the horror of trying to get PALM and VERIZON to own up to this fact and give me a different phone...ANY Phone. I asked for a refurbished 1999 Audiovox, because at least I know I can make and recive calls. They will not even do that for me. Because of my positve history with the PALM operating system, I am still going to give PALM one more chance, but I am going back to the PALM operating system with the TREO 680.

"My Sony-Ericson HBH-DS970 has worked fine with my Treo 650 for more than a year now. The problem is it keeps failing. I keep exchanging it under warranty but it's a hassle and I'd like to find something more reliable. I use my headset while riding my bicycle and need something like the DS970 with earbuds. Cans and bike helmets don't mix. Much of the time, I just leave the earbuds out but set up my Treo to auto-answer on the 2nd ring. All I have to do then to take a call is stick an earbud (either one) in an ear and say ""hello"" once it picks up. My only other complaint about the DS970 is that the battery life isn't long enough when I'm listening to music or a book on tape. When I'm on a long trip and won't be jostling the ever so fragile headphone jack on my Treo, I plug in a wired headset. When I can't do that and want to be able to listen on and off throughout the day, I've learned to power down the headset at times when I can just as easily answer the phone without the headset, i.e. when I'm not driving or riding my bike. I really like the way it pauses the music when a call comes in. The music quality is acceptable for what it is.

"I use this with my BlackBerry 7290. My primary motivation for buying the Motorola HF820 was that it would serve both as a car handsfree device while I was driving, and as a regular speakerphone for my blackberry 7290 at other times. Having used it for a couple of days, I would say it works satisfactorily but is not great. The voice quality could be better. You don't get a whole lot of controls other than basic volume and on/off buttons. One thing you might want to know: When your box arrives, you have to charge the device for 2 hours before you can start using it. Okay, you say. No big deal. Well, the annoying part is there's no wall charger included. I ended up buying an iGo charger ($29) from Radio Shack.

"I have never had a Bluetooth headset before the 510. I use it with a Motorola i870 Nextel phone. The headset works great, sometimes it disconnects for a moment and I just press the button on the side of the headset and it reconnects. The talk time is awesome and I have gotten almost 5 hours continuous talk time out of the device. The range isn't too bad I think I can get about 30 feet from my i870. If only my crappy Nextel phone could keep up will the quality of the headset. Since my i870 battery goes dead in like 1 1/2 with the extended batter pack I have to plug it in to charge. However, while it's plugged in I can still use the 510 and wander all over the house and still talk on the phone. It almost replaces the phone if I could dial from it. The best part is that when you get too far away it gets a little static so that you know to come back closer and then the sound quality clears up. Everyone I have spoken with on the headset says it sounds very nice and clear.

"I really wanted to like the N78 - filled to the brim with all sorts of features in a very attractive case - but it was just too buggy to live with. Being able to set the phone up as a wireless access point using the brilliant JoikuSpot download was incredible, and certainly one of the things I'll miss most as I repackaged this and ship it back to Amazon. I feel (or at least hope) that my unit was just defective, so take some of the issues I had with a grain of salt - it may not happen on all devices, but here are some of the things I experienced: 1. Camera zoom stopped working after the first picture taken. It's a digital zoom, so not the most critical thing in the world, but still annoying when you want to frame a shot and can't. This was fixed when performing a factory reset using the *#7370# combination, however once I tried re-importing contacts, the camera zoom would break again. 2. I kept getting the phone's welcome message - about twice a day - no damnit, I don't want to see an introductory video on how to use the phone, leave me alone already! 3. Browser would crash and freeze constantly. 4. Phone would randomly restart - like right after going into Contacts to make a call. What I liked * JoikuSpot. One of the primary reasons I bought a Nokia - the ability to have a 3G based wireless access point on me at all times is really powerful and useful. * Screen. Bright, crisp, very nicely done * Design. Obviously very subjective, but I enjoyed looking at it in my hand - not something you can say about most Nokias * Predictive text. Coming from an old Motorola, I hadn't realized how horrible I had it. * Internet radio. I don't use my phone too much for music, but having all those internet radio stations has come in handy a few times and it's a pretty handy feature. What I didn't like: * Sluggish interface. This is my first Nokia smartphone, so I was expecting to see it fly based on all the reviews comparing this to previous Nokia models. There was a noticeable lag in everything I did. With fewer than 20 contacts on my phone, it took 1-2 seconds to load my list of contacts - meaning I couldn't just press ""Contacts + first letter"" to start filtering names right away - I had to pause for a second or two. * Menu-laden UI. I know there are plenty of shortcuts for this, but really, somebody needs to be taken out back and put out of their misery for the ridiculous number of menu options put in this phone. How often do people really make video calls - does that really have to be a default option when d-padding a contact's phone number? * Slow default browser. Opera Mini was orders of magnitude faster, but links from emails still open in the default browser, so having that suck still makes things frustratingly slow * Lack of camera lens cover. Not having it makes me nervous about ever putting the phone down on a hard surface Overall, I gave it 3 stars because I really liked the form factor, the screen, and just the sheer power of what it could do. If I could be assured that a new N78 wouldn't have the obvious issues mine had, I'd probably give it another go as there's really nothing else out on the market that has all this has for those in US 3G territory until the Xperia X1 comes out.",neutral,neutral,0.3514443548989828,0.5429412597396869,0.10561438536133029

"I have used just about every major brand Bluetooth headsets. Comparatively, this headset stands somewhere in the middle of the crowd. Pros: 1) Light weight and comfortable to wear. I love the soft gel type ear-tip. I wear it whole day for close to 12 hours and can honestly say that at times I don't even realize that I am wearing a Bluetooth headset. (However, this ""light weight"" leads in to a short-coming as we shall see later). 2) Easy to charge unlike my other Plantronics Discovery/Explorer headsets (that I have purchased over the last 2 years to last 2 months range). Plantronics headset button-type charger mechanism is very fragile. Gentle touch is sufficient enough to stop these headsets from charging and requires some ""playing around"" to get charging process going again. However, this BlackBerry HS-655+ uses a mini-USB, type B connector. As a result, charger plug establishes a solid, reliable connection, that is not prone to such contact problems. Once you connect charger cable to the charging cradle, just insert your headset properly and forget about it. Contact problems are virtually non-existent in this headset/cradle combination. 3) Stylish, matches my Blackberry. 4) Sound quality is extremely good on both ends (though doesn't even come close to my Jabra BT5010 or Nokia Bluetooth headsets). 5) Volume level is loud enough for most occasions and purposes. 6) If your phone supports it, you will get notifications of incoming emails, text messages etc. via this Bluetooth headset, when paired successfully with your phone. 7) Pairing was a snap. It successfully pairs with my 2 phones (Samsung and BlackBerry) every time. 8) Quick connect and disconnect (unlike my Motorola and Jabra bluetooth headsets). 9) Supports call mute, last number redial and voice dial feature. However, voice dial feature never worked with my phones. (Jabra BT5010 works like a charm when it comes to voice dial). 10) Easy to carry around with charging cradle that doubles as a shirt clip-on carry case for this headset. Cons: 1) Dismal battery life. Battery needs to be charged every day, invariably. Even with modest use (say 80-100 minutes talk time everyday and rest in standby mode), you will end up charging it every day. 2) Voice dial feature may/may not work. 3) Power/Call connect/Disconnect button is somewhat hard to press, especially when you are wearing this headset. 4) In order to change the Right ear to Left ear configuration (or vice versa), you have to physically remove the soft gel ear tip, then remove the ear hook, then install them accordingly in the reverse order. Little tedious, not a big deal, but I guess I got used to Plantronics Discovery headsets (swiveling pivot type mechanism), where this interchange is addressed smoothly. Overall, it is a mixed bag when you own this headset. However, if you are getting it for (almost) free after MIR, you won't be sorry with your purchase.",neutral,neutral,0.04747491695336731,0.7238237757661953,0.22870130728043744

"What all can you expect for five dollars? My friend and I like to drive around and play Pokemon go, but she gets disconnected a lot. I work in remote areas, so I was looking for a way to get cell signals farther out anyway. I know some radio dudes, and they all told me there was no way this thing could actually do anything I tried this thing out, and it seemed to help... maybe... in one spot in town, but we decided it wasn't really doing anything. I mean, it wasn't hurting, so I left it on for a while, but there was no way it was actually doing anything, right? Turns out it was hurting, because the spot I put it in meant that when I tried to wash my windows, there would be a big squeegee drip going down the middle of the windshield... Time for this thing to go. I ripped it off, and pulled up the tape on both sides. Turns out there is some sort of circuit board with a lot of coiled wire on the inside one. That's... well... if you were going to make one of these so they did something, you'd need that... I picked up my friend, and we drove around to play our game. half the spots we'd found since I got this antenna suddenly didn't work for her at all, and were a lot harder for me to connect with too. I guess it was working. On the package, they note that if there is no cell service at all, this antenna will not be able to do anything, and even in areas where there is coverage, it supposedly will only add half a bar. I guess it was adding half a bar in some places around town. A lot of users got this for their homes, since it says that it can be used there too. The package I got said ""For Vehicle use only."" I'm not sure if ones for home use only exist or not. Antennas like this, if they can do anything, need to have their inner part and their outer part placed a specific distance apart. Auto glass tends to be a thin single pane of 1/16-1/4 inch thick. Home windows tend to be double-pane, with 1/2 to 2 inches between the panes. If you live in an old house with single pane windows, the ones for automotive use might work there.",neutral,negative,0.8565676750938238,0.11694025593488312,0.026492068971292953
"On the plus side, it has excellent voice quality, good ergonomics, and is easy to use. Thankfully the detachable ear bracket isn't necessary except in active situations (exercising, etc.). The included accessories (unique ""micro-usb"" neck lanyard, carrying pouch and extra ear gels) are a nice bonus. Generally it's a good headset but on the negative side, I've noticed it is prone to annoying static when used outdoors. This occurs frequently but never when used inside the car. I have experienced this type of interference with older Plantronics sets as well. Range is average at best. My previous LG headset had much stronger reception towards the fringe of the 30' radius. I purchased the unit primarily for communication, however the ""stereo"" feature is certainly convenient. That said, if you're into ""quality"" audio, even the cheapest wired earbuds will sound better. Overall, I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend this unit.

"I previously had a regular cell phone with Cingular. Though I was quite happy with Cingular's service, I was really attracted to the idea of the Sidekick, since it could do web and had (or so they promised) both AOL and Yahoo IM which is only available through Tmobile so I switched. That and the qwerty keyboard, ..I never could enter stuff easily on a Palm, and forget trying to type actual words on a regular phone pad, maybe I""m too old for that. This looked easier. So its good good and bad points...the phone itself is pretty nifty. The keyboard is very easy to use and I can type pretty fast on it. Not 80 wpm but not bad. You will see people complaign that the ALT key is not backlit which is true, but it hasn't been a problem so far. Its not a nice little notepad and calendar feature. The screen is nice and clear. Its really cool having all this stuff in one phone. And oh, they don't mention it anywhere, but it makes a darned handy flashlight. The screen is pretty bright, and you can also press =F and get it to just be a flashlight. The down side is the marketing makes it out to be much better than it really is. Browsing is..so so. You can get to a lot more sites than I expected, but it doesn't do Javascript, which a lot of sites rely on to work. For example I can read posts on a popular blog site but not update. Most of the time browsing is slllllow. I wasn't expecting T-1 speed, I know its a phone and all, but was just hoping for the speed of my old 56 modem, but its not even that fast. Its - go and get a cup of coffee and come back - speed. But, I got a little majong game on it, so I enter the page I want, and to play majong till it blinks that its ready. Its not fast, but being able to look up the address of a restaurant from the parking lot of Target is pretty darn handy. And oh its got its own email acct too which works okay. No bells and whistles but it works. The camera sucks..I mean I wasn't expecting much at all, but its so bad I could do better with crayons. Seriously tanks. But hey I didn't buy it for the camera. What I DID buy it for though, and the reason I gave this a 3 despite the niftiness of the phone, was YAHOO IM. I was *told* by t-mobile both on the phone and in person at the store, that sure, it had yahoo IM, you just have to download it. It advertises this on their site and on the box. 90% of my friends are on Yahoo not AOL. Well as it turns out you CAN download it, but then..trying to actually IM on it is nearly impossible. It disconnects you VERY frequently with no notice or indication whatsoever for about 10-15 minutes. It disconnects easily every 5 minutes. If you check the sidekick forum on the hiptop danger site (the people who make the gadget) you will see its a very very common issue. Despite this issue being so common I've tried to contact T-mobile repeatedly and they were utterly unresponsive, and insisted they could not help, it was not supported by them I had to contact yahoo. They gave me no info to do so. I kept telling them THEY said it was included but they say as it wasn't preinstalled its not supported. What?? So I finally found a Yahoo help email buried in their site and emailed them, and now THEY say its not supported either!!! (and more to that effect). That the only thing supported is the mobile.yahoo.com site, which doesn't quite work either. So even though its advertised and what I paid for, it works well only maybe 5% of the time and neither Tmobile or Yahoo want anything to do with resolving the issue. THe AOL IM works fairly well, but not yahoo. But I don't know anyone on AOL so that doesn't help. MSN btw is totally not available but at least that I knew going in. As far as signal strength goes, its so so. The phone is fairly consistently all the bars where I live, but it still is more staticy and cuts out more than cingular did (on the old network not the new one I had an OLD phone). The data service is spotty. It works maybe 75% of the time. Doesn't work in my house at all. But luckily its the 75% of the time I need it to work so its good enough on that count. And oh..its a bit bulky for a phone, but not bad when you get used to it, and its got a handy speaker. THe speaker has a bit of a delay, but the sound quality isn't bad. SO the sidekick in theory is really neat. I'd love to see where this type of gadget is in a couple years. But right now..ARGH.. its still got some bugs and Tmobile apparently does not care one bit about its customers and trying to resolve these things. THey have their 200 and me in a contract, so I guess that's that as far as they are concerned. If I had to do it over again I'd probably get a regular Cingular phone and one of those Ogos for the IM. Its *got* to work better, cause on the Sidekick it doesn't work at all. If you just want basic web, a phone, and aol then get it. If you want Yahoo IM, definately look elsewhere.",neutral,neutral,0.06419195709494768,0.9295096495281956,0.006298393376856771

"My recent purchase of the Mobile Office Tools for Motorola RAZR 3 was everything I had anticipated. After reading previous owners' review, I made the purchase. Yes, it is a very basic tools package, but it is the best ""bang for the buck"". One feature that is worth the price of admission has been the ringtone editor. Although it may not have many all the bells and whistles other higher price packages have, it is well worth the $9 spent on this software. I've been able to create my own personalized ringtones from my extensive music collection and I'm not locked in to ""others"" idea of what part of my music makes a ""cool"" ringtone. Plus, the USB cable alone is worth the amount paid. I still have to work with the other features, but I've saved a bundle on ringtones alone.

"I have two of these. One of them works the other has a very hollow and tinny sound. People constantly complain they cannot hear what is being said. So I called BlueAnt technical support, twice. This was after trying to deal with them by email. The first time when we got to the point where I said I wanted a replacement unit the support guy hung up on me. The second time I was told I needed to go through a process that would take about 30 minutes. At the end of that process they might have me send the unit back and they would try it with other phones - I guess the iPhones (3 of them), the Motorola and the Nokia I had tried were not good enough - then decide if they were going to replace it. So basically I would send it to them and they would send it back and say it was fine or working to their spec. From other comments here there are many people with the same problem and judging by some of those comments there are a large number that have had trouble with their call center. If the product works it is OK, not stunning but does its job, but if it does not work or if it fails beyond Amazon's return window then you are in serious trouble. My experience saw a 50% failure rate. ANNND this is with a fairly simple piece of technology, how reliable is their more complex stuff likely to be.

"The Bluetooth itself works very well. Clear loud and easy to use. Everything you could want in a Bluetooth device. However, just like the other Blue Ant Bluetooth devices.

They don't fit in their ear properly, not quality of the product. 3 out of 5 is a pretty bad ratio! If it was not for the ear buds I would have given this Bluetooth 5 out of 5 stars.

It also creates a long (1 second) tone whenever the first button is pushed when making a call or when already in a call. I think this is due to the same reason that makes it slow to navigate. It's like it gets hung up on a command for a short time. It could use a faster processor or whatever it is that cell phones use. It's more annoying than anything, and cuts out the audio when the 1 second tone is sounding. i actually sent back the first one beacuse of this, but the replacement still did the same thing.

"I purchased the Garmin 200 after reading a lot of positive reviews on Amazon. It was a great product - simple design, easy to use. Unfortunately, it started to malfunction after 3 months. For example, it would just shut itself down even though it was plugged into a running car. Then the connection between the unit and the charger AND the charger and the car began to weaken. I say both because the red light that indicates the charger is plugged in doesn't always turn on, and if it's on, the unit doesn't always charge. I have another cigarette car charger that works just fine so I know the problem isn't my car. When I was able to get both connections going in my car, the unit would display that it was trying to read the connection to my computer. For something that is over $100 and was only used 3 times (once a month on average) for approximately 2 hours at a time, it should last more than 3 months. For those who are wondering, I didn't leave it in a freezing cold or oven-hot car and kept it in a drawer in my desk when it was not being used. When I contacted Garmin to get a replacement unit or charger within the warranty period, I was told that the unit had to be completely dead to qualify for a replacement. As most people know, electronic items often exhibit problems well before they fully die, if ever. If my unit starts to malfunction when I'm driving 65mph down the freeway, it's ""completely dead"" to me because I can't fuss with it and safely drive at the same time. Garmin's ""has to be dead"" policy is a pretty poor stall tactic to run out the warranty period.

"I just got this at my local Radio Shack store for 30 bucks. Activating on Virgin Mobile USA's website gave me $2.50 in starter airtime.

Even checking balance (by pressing the ""up"" key on the navigation pad) takes 30 seconds, vs. 5 seconds or so on my 7-Eleven Speak Out Wireless-running RAZR. Sometimes, even pressing the End key to return to the standby screen takes a full second, which is really slow for such an easy operation.

It's available aftermaket only. 2. The trackwheel is undersized and difficult to roll accurately. 3. Because BlackBerry contracts to info-secure government agencies, the bluetooth doesn't support any data transfer whatsoever. Forget using salling clicker or any other fun/useful bluetooth application. 4. The plastic casing is thin and seems inadequately flimsy to house such versatile, rugged software.

"Oh boy, I hate this phone today. I have had my phone almost 2yrs, first year was just fine. After that my phone wouldn't stay charged for very long and reception got worse, also the screen started to fade. So first I got an internal antenna, it didn't help. So I went to a t-mobile store to get a new battery, the sales person told me they didn't have any for my phone in stock and told me to buy one from another company online that they were just as good. I did, holds charge even less time then the old one. Well this morning, for the second time my phone turned itself off while charging and dumped all my wallpapers, ALL, I don't even have the ones that came with the phone, I have a white screen. It also dumped all my purchased ringtones. And now after charging all last night my phone is dead, it died around 2:00pm.

"Admittedly, when this first became available, it sounded like a fabulous concept. Over a six month period, I purchased three Bundles, and subsequently bought many different adapters. I was highly annoyed, BTW, with the absence of the iPod adapter (IPDA-0001) from the Bundle, as others have written here. None were used in a mobile environment; mine sits on my desk, my wife's on her desk at work, and my step-daughter's on her desk at college, where they are not subjected to stress or abuse. Then the adapters started to fail. The first two iPod adapters split longitudinally along the plastic housing and died. The 3rd iPod adapter just croaked, period. And therein lies the story of the next two-and-a-half years, failure after failure: Two generic USB adapters (CHUA-0011), one mini-USB (MUSB-0001), one Plantronics (PLNA-00001) and two others. What is the problem? I'm convinced it's poor and shoddy manufacturing. Most of these adapters arrive out-of-the-box with the two ends out of sync, forcing the user to twist them in order for the charger hub and device-to-be charged to lie flat together. No matter how little force you exert, it is still too much for the obviously flimsy wiring connections inside the connector housings. I also noticed, as I replaced them, different wire lengths between the two connectors, especially on the iPod unit (they have also now changed the housing on that adapter, obviously due to the shell-splitting problem I mentioned above). That's another sign that whoever is producing these is not adhering to a specification, or Callpod changed suppliers, or both. Remember, all of this was just from simple desktop use, never detaching the adapters. I cannot imagine the failure rate if one were to utilize this system in a mobile application, where the adapters would be subjected to constant attachment/detachment cycles from the hub. The tines on the herkin' AC adapter do not fold into the housing, and, astonishingly, the tines on the optional ""mobile"" AC adapter don't either, so both are pretty much useless for travel, unless you want to damage items inside your case, or the case itself. I'm sick and tired of returning and replacing these adapters. I'm going to sell all three of the chargers and revert to outlet strips and multiple chargers. I strongly suggest you avoid this product... it was a great concept, but ownership is an absolute annoyance. September 2010 update: iPod adapter #4 R.I.P.

That one was probably made in China (the included battery said so) but the case was not airplane aluminium and the keyboard was definitely not like the original. The metal was a lot thinner.

"I love the Otterbox holster for the protection it provides my phone. However, the spring will wear out after nine months or so of use. I had to take the spring out and adjust it so it would work. But it only lasted for a few weeks before the clip was loose again. This model (for the Black Berry Curve 8330) has the ability to swivel (which apparently all of their holsters do, I am told). Again, after nine months or so of use the holster will swivel much too easily. I don't like the ability of the holster to swivel so I fixed that with some screws. I used a screw to fix the clip as well. Customer service from Otter Box is certainly lacking. I contacted them with the following message: Hi. I purchased my Otter Box Defender on May 24, 2009 from Amazon.com LLC. Recently, the belt clip that rotates on the holster is so loose that it rotates on my belt too easily. The spring on the clip itself is so weak that I have had my phone drop off of my belt and land on the floor. Is there any way to replace the rotating belt clip? I love my Otter Box and the protection it gives my phone. I don't want to give it up for something with less protection but has better components. Thank you. The following was the only response received: Update for Case #93443 - ""Holster clip"" If you send me your name address and phone type that we are carrying. Thanks, [name of customer service rep] I don't know what they were going to do to resolve this. I thought that by asking for my name and address they would have sent me another holster.

We have had this amplifier for about five years now with no troubles. The time when we purchased this we had no cell service in our house at all and were lucky if we could make a call outside. Installed the amp and bingo you can talk any where in the house you want. It seem like alot of money but if you use your cell phone and not your land line it will pay itself in less than a year. These amplifiers are the best money one can spend if you don't have very good service in your area.

"I've been impressed by the windshield lock-grip of Garmin Nuvi units and even by the effectiveness of a 9-dollar silly-looking gooseneck that not only held my iPod in place but charged it and served as reliable FM transmitter to boot. This latter item item didn't score well with other Amazon customers--proof that you can't always trust the ratings. In the case of this ""Universal Car Vent or Dash Mount Holder,"" you can trust the consumer ratings--in fact, they may even be a bit high. The device is branded as a ""Cellet"" universal mount in the title, but in the description it's referred to as a ""Luxmo"" universal mount. No matter. A poorly designed piece of plastic is--by any name--a potentially useless piece of plastic. The idea here is that you can, if you choose, unscrew the base and toss it so that it's not in the way of the bracket, which you then are supposed to insert in any convenient ""vent."" Unfortunately, my air vents were either too narrow or too wide to accept the bracket, or ""Vent Mount (non)solution."" So it was on to Plan B, the ""Dash Mount"" solution (at least it's a versatile little fellow). But the base for this kitschy piece of curious clutter is no more than a single square inch. Moreover, I had kept the unit for over a year before deciding to give it a try. So not only was the sticky substance spread over too small a foundation: it was no longer sufficiently sticky to hold in place my iPod Touch even if the surface area were a whole foot! Here's where I was spared the worst nemesis of every neophyte--i.e. making a bad thing worse by trying to make it better. In other words, I was about to get out the Crazy Glue and muck up my otherwise clean dashboard when it struck me that maybe I ought to see if this ""adjustable"" guy actually would clasp my iPod as advertised. Upon pressing the button for releasing the spring and extending the gizmo's right arm, nothing happened. His right arm was jammed (and the left is clearly non-adjustable). Since he obviously needed a helping hand, I gave him one. Unfortunately, my gentle tugging pressure was enough to snap off that piece of plastic on the right side of this holder with the (non) ""Adjustable Grip."" Mercifully, the experience came to an end before I'd given this low-(but over)priced imposter a chance to show its stuff. But even more fortunately, I can now put this review to rest. May the next buyer have a happier story to tell. As for me, I'm back to my original clunky and unsightly but effective mount with the gooseneck:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/GSI-Super-Quality-Wireless-Hands-Free-5-in-1-Dock-Mount-Charger-FM-Transmitter-Car-Kit-with-Goose-neck-Mount-for-Ipod-IPhone-4-3G-3GS-MP3-MP4-CD-DVD-Players-Includes-Remote-Control-Audio-Cable-LCD-Display-Cigarette-Lighter-Plug-In/dp/B003U4R42K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">GSI Super Quality Wireless Hands-Free 5-in-1 Dock-Mount-Charger-FM Transmitter-Car Kit, with Goose-neck Mount for Ipod, IPhone 4-3G-3GS, MP3, MP4, CD, DVD Players - Includes Remote Control, Audio Cable, LCD Display - Cigarette Lighter Plug-In</a>.",negative,negative,0.6572419001726828,0.3297890773475407,0.012969022479776389

"Probably a 3 1/2 star vs 4, but since I had to choose, I chose 4. Here is the lowdown: 1) Did tons of research, mostly online but also at a local Best Buy. The best buy only had one pair of blue tooth stereo headphones period, and the sales kid (I do stress ""kid"") told me ""This is the only pair we have in stock right now and these are the only ones on the market...no one else even sells one"" of course theirs were $149 and they would not let me try them out. Also considered motorola, HK, samsung, and others. 2) According to C-Net, amazon, bizrate, and others these were consistently the best performers rated for bluetooth headphones...amazon had the best price, even over bizrate, ebay, etc. 3) Got the headphones in a very timely manner (it helps to live within one day delivery for supersaver shipping...heh heh heh) and set them up very easily for my wife to use with her new samsung cell phone to listen to tunes from the micro SD card. 4) SHE LOVES THEM....they work well in high-noise environments (the gym) they have enough volume, intuitive controls that are easily accessible and the bluetooth connection is strong. One of my worries was the fact that they were rechargable and how long a charge would last. She used them until they literally died before recharging and it resulted in over 10 days total - turning them off when not in use, then with a solid 4-5 hours of playback time, about 1 hour a day every other day. I imagine if you kept them on all the time and/or used the playback constantly it would likely give you 7 hours+ of playback time at relatively high volume. Good performance. 5) Here is the downside...they only fit medium sized people (if that is the right phrase). I am 6'2"" and large-ish (ok, 260 lbs). The behind the neck band, which works great for my supermodel-ish wife only works for me if I keep my head down, staring into my lap. If I move my head or look up (or even straight ahead for that matter) the neck band pulls the ear-pads off my ears enough to mess with the music. Not a good thing. Someone needs to come up with a neck band that is adjustable and will work for larger than average sized folks. 6) #5 above and the fact that the headphones lack a very broad dynamic range (somewhat tinny highs, muted mids, not very low lows) is why I downgraded this to a 3 1/2 to 4 stars, but really the music quality I would rate just below Very Good and the fit and comfort, for my wife at least, is exemplary. Nice job Cardo, now fix the head band and get a stronger driver and you will have a perfect set of headphones.",positive,positive,0.017345653451120623,0.2972442945860795,0.6854100519627998

"I upgraded to this phone nearly 2 months ago, and overall I like it a lot. I have not taken advantage of all the features on this phone, so I will only talk about the things I have experience with: cell-phone quality, camera, and audio/video player ability. There is a silver version available, but I was more partial to red. First off, the cell phone is sleek and smart looking. The not-too-slim profile fits easily in any standard shirt or pant pocket. The 2.2 inch screen is very generous for a cell phone, and is easier on the eyes when watching videos, surfing the web, etc. You can receive calls without having to open the phone and thankfully the audio quality of the calls is very good. The 2 mega-pixel camera is good for a cell phone. The pictures taken are crisp and lack the fuzziness that some other cell-phone cameras have. The zoom is not all that great, but certainly it is better than having none. However, when taking pictures, you cannot zoom in when your resolution is set to the highest setting. You can also take pictures on the fly without having to open the phone to access the camera. Good enough for still photographs, but pretty useless for anything fast. Pretty much what I would expect from a cell phone. I am not that impressed with the video-capturing option, though you can use zoom during filming. My old cell phone was not able to do that. I am very happy with both the audio/video player functions. With a 4 gig microsd card, you can play a lot of music or videos on the shine with little noticeable skip between different songs/videos. With the ear-buds, music is surprisingly crisp and clear. This can function as a good audio player. You can create folders on the microsd card, which can be similar to playlists. The video quality was clear in the small portrait view, but suffers in quality when the larger landscape view is used. Although, it is not so bad that you cannot tell what you are looking at. For me, the landscape view quality was adequate (not good or great). However, what is great is that if you find a good converter for the .gpp video file extension, you can play full length movies fairly well. You can find a .gpp converter for free on the internet. The skip forward function is useful because it speeds after a little while (good for long video files), but takes some time to get used to because of the joystick navigation. And speaking of the joystick navigation, it does take time to become proficient in it. But it does not detract from using the phone at all. There are two negative things about this phone that I want to mention which prevent me from giving it 5 stars: I can see how this phone would not be a good text-messenger phone, since the keys seem a little squished and can be difficult for people with big fingers. While I like this feature a lot, it can be argued that the landscape video quality is poor. I wanted a phone that could play music and videos, have expandable storage capacity, and looks good. The LG Shine fits the bill very well.",positive,positive,0.003789327041095296,0.4506995007010706,0.5455111722578341
"Earpiece is small and fits nicely. Price was a good bargain. Good features. It was marketed as noise canceling, but people on the other side of the line have complained about background noise.

"The 1st time I used Our Signal Booster it worked great. Cell phone went from 2 bars to 4 bars for both voice and 3G data (Verizon). Laptop Verizon AirCard went from about 500 Kbps to 1000 kbps download speeds. Very nice! However, the second time I used it, I tried pointing the high power antenna out a window on the opposite side of the house to see if there was a closer cell site. I followed the directions, including making sure the low power antenna was greater than 20 feet away and pointed towards the high power antenna before turning on. This time, it initially showed a green light, then a red light and the light faded. I moved the low power antenna further away from the high power antenna and tried again. This time the light didn't come on anymore. I tried moving things to the way everything worked the very 1st time, but no light would come on. It was using power, because the low power unit was getting warm. The coax connection point was also getting really warm. But, it was no longer boosting the signal (no change in cell phone bars). It seems to have gone dead! We contacted the company (who seems very nice)and they said they will do a warranty replacement of the amplifier. We will update with details! I would have given the product 4 stars had it not failed us so quickly. <a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wilson-Electronics-801247-Desktop-Cell-Phone-Signal-Booster-for-Home-or-Office-For-Multiple-Users/dp/B0014KOB6Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wilson Electronics 801247 Desktop Cell Phone Signal Booster for Home or Office - For Multiple Users</a>http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014KOB6Y/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title",neutral,negative,0.4856551864886665,0.18074064412254,0.33360416938879345

"I bought this unit about a year ago, mostly because my sister had one and thought it was really good. Also liked the fact that it can't be turned on accidentally. When it arrived I tested it, and even though I could hear on it the person on the other end could not hear me. I tried turning it off and on, tried muting and un-muting it - nothing fixed it. Perplexed, I called Motorola customer service. They said they'd send me another one, but I had to pay to ship back the one I had - with a company that tracks it (way more expensive than regular USPS). The second one arrived - and had the same problem! I happened to notice on the paperwork that it was a refurbished one. So I called customer service yet again, and this time I insisted they send me a brand-new, in original packaging one. Once again I had to pay for the shipping myself, but at least the 3rd time was a charm. This one worked! Now, about a year later, suddenly the mic has gone out on this one. I handle the thing very carefully, it's never dropped or abused in any way. I have to say DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT!!!

The replacement for this phone works well, but has defects on the paint. Another phone shuts down automatically after 3 months use, but works well without the MicroSD. Again the MicroSD works great on the other CU920. Even re-calibrated, the precision and consistent sensitivity of the touch screen is far from iPhone and iTouch. Dial someone in the contact list is fine, but if you dial through the pad for some codes and phone numbers, you are very likely to mistype or double type digits. Today I found one pin of connector of the earphone was bent. The tiny design of the connector is prone to damage.

"I have owned one cardo previous to this it was the 500 series. I had purchased the 500 series at my cell phone store when I got a phone upgrade and payed $80 for it. Then I decided to shop on line and found it here for much cheaper so I returned it only to buy a different model the 700 series cause I figured the newer the better. Boy was I wrong. The 700 is very muffled on my end and every one says my calls were staticy on there end and then to top it off When I was getting in my car I bumped it pretty good on my door frame and now it works for sh@t. So newer isn't always better. The 500 had good sound on my end and my friends said it sounded normal on there end.

"This was my first bluetooth headset and after using it for a week I was very disappointed. The phone I used it with is a brand new LG Venus.

My other gripe was with the sound quality. It's subpar at best. The sound was fuzzy and unclear even with my phone on my desk two feet away. On full volume the sound also became some what distorted.

"....but not at first. When I received my meter and started working with it I realized that it was out of calibration. (The instructions tell you how to check.) I called the manufacturer and they said that either the (included) battery was run down or it was a defective meter. They offered to replace it immediately, but I opted to try battery replacement first, which didn't work. The next day the manufacturer sent me a new meter via Priority Mail, and included a stamped, self-addressed box with which to return the defective one. Such a pleasure to do business with these people, especially since the same Amazon shipment included a defective Panasonic phone which I'm having to return at my own expense, and only after they receive it will they send me a refurbished phone in exchange, and in the meantime I'm not able to fax out or receive messages. And the meter is great. The Hazard Thresholds marked in red on the readout agree with the research I've previously done on the subject. It's the perfect instrument for household/consumer (as opposed to professional) use, and it's a very reasonable price for the level and kinds of fields it measures. I'm glad I got it--I've been reassured about many potential sources of dangerous EMFs in my environment, and thoroughly alarmed about the magnetic fields emanating from the florescent lighting in my kitchen and my husband's shop.

"This product by no means really lived up to the others in its league, in fact if not for the simple design flaw, I will say it is arguably the king of 'behind-the-ear' bluetooth headsets! I have so far pre-Cardo, used the following: Motorola HT820; Nokia BH501; Blu-Ant X5 (the most rubbish product and a total waste of money - see my review on Amazon.com) and somewhere else. Now I am not a novice in this bluetooth headset design and usage - electronic design engineer and avid user of advance technology- so I am in good stead to qualify this product, and here I go... Bought product while in US about a month ago from Amazon, delivered with speed from Amazon.com (you guys are by the way competitively the best out there!). I was simply impressed with the simplicity but detailed transparent RRP box, on it, is a quick info on all buttons on the Cardo S2 so no need of reading huge user guides/manuals! On carefully opening the box, the slick headset was made with what I considered to be high quality rubber-like/plastic material which is highly flexible and friendly to the skin. Has a bit of charge in it to test it but manufacturer's recommended advice is charge for 4hrs before initial use - good advice. Lots of futuristic and practical functions and features e.g hold /lock switch which prevents accidental button push by ... your hat or head bandanna ;) ; integrated thumb-operated wheel rotate to enable your PDA's media player play, forward, rewind, pause... this feature is soooo cool! Another cool feature is it goes to sleep when phone is disconnected but once paired with any device (at least with my T-Mobile AMEO phone/pda), it always connected as soon as phone available without any action from you! this is the coolest feature for me. The quality of music is as loud and bassy as Nokia's BH501 (the best for this) but not as crispy-bassy as Motorola's huge (only downside by the way) HT820 - this is best for durability, longevity..mine is still going strong after 3 years of use, and speech through in-built non-protruding microphone, is better than the two best competitors - Nokia BH501 and Motorola HT820 - I stopped hearing from people's general complains of I can't hear you clearly... To the flaw...and yes there is just one but not unique to this product: Cardo's lower part of the thicker plastic that holds the speakers snapped! First encountered with Nokia BH501 disappointingly. If you look very closely where there a fine line (by design) across the ear hook, as you take the headset on and off, with unavoidable pressure always applied at these point, within a short time the stress becomes greater and ....crack goes the handle!!!! I have engineered this in my little lab reinforcing the 'bridge' with metallic object (embedded with soldering iron) to hold it firmly, going well so far.... S2 deserves 5/5 but for this design flaw, I believe they should re-visit this part of the design. In comparisons to others in its league then it is a force to be reckoned with. And it indeed has a good value for money. I will buy another shortly.",neutral,positive,0.09597373561182451,0.2029672310216294,0.7010590333665462

"Excellent product, this is my second purchase I have put this to a stressful test. I weld for a living and am under a constant shower of debris. These are rugged, light weight and the quality of the sound is superb. As an added bonus they have 3 preset equalizer settings, but without any way to distinguish which is which; only the 'beep' is heard when switching. My biggest issue is that the length of the flat cables are maybe an inch short, so if you have to turn your head too far you end up pulling on the cable where it connects to the neck piece which is likely the most fragile point of the whole thing. The thick rubber elastics holding the cable to the device broke on my first pair, after continued stress eventually the sound died in one side... although this was after a year of almost daily use for 10 hours at a time. The battery life is better than advertised. I work 10 hour shifts and I usually have to let the device continue to run for another hour or two (depending on standby time) to drain the battery completely before charging. Range is surprising when signal can get through. At work I can be over 100ft from my phone (obstructed by a lot of aluminum and steel) and still experience no lag, no difficulty controlling the track or play/pause features. At home however I have difficulty when i'm 30ft down the hall getting almost any signal; pesky walls. Could use a 'previous track' button and more support around the flat cables connecting points.

"The first Motorola Krzr K1M(white) I purchased from Verizon lasted less than 3 weeks before many of the functions ceased to work. I was instructed to cycle power on the phone--this worked once. Then many of the functions on the phone ceased to work altogether. Thought I had a defective phone, so Verizon replaced it free. I love the appearance of the phone and its functional setup. With my new phone I was able to transfer music files to the microSD card for about a week. Then the phone would no longer connect to my PC. I reloaded the USB drivers many times and swapped in known good USB cables--all to no avail. My computer would recognize the hardware connect as a Motorola K1M/L7c, but refused to interface with it. I called Verizon and they gave me a software fix via download. This worked for about 3 days, then back to the same thing--whenever I attempted to connect the phone in ""sync"" mode, I would get a ""connection failed"" message on the phone. This appears to be no fluke--2 brand new phones of the same model plus a (known to Verizon, hence the downloadable fix)software glitch. I love the phone--it works great. The video and still camera works great. But the music transfer system is abysmal.

Attempts to get the problems resolved on the phone failed (we can't do that here), attempts to return it to the store failed (that was sent to you by our phone sales group, you can't return it here), and a final desperate attempt to resolve it through Cingular's Office of the CEO was meet by ""you shouldn't have tried to transfer your service from AT&T to Cingular"" (i.e. it's your fault) and ""you're trying to order the most expensive phone we have, what do you expect us to do, give you a free one?"" (i.e. you're trying to cheat us). My experiences can basically be catagorized in the following fashion: * You're an AT&T customer, you'll need to call Cingular for that. * You're a Cingular customer, you'll need to call AT&T for that. * You're a corporate customer, we're the retail group. You'll need to call business services for that. * You did that over the phone, you'll need to take up that problem with telesales. * You did that in the store, you'll need to take up that problem with them. * That can't be done over the web. * I don't know how to do that. I think the crowning touch however, was the retail store that refused to sell me the phone because my account is tagged as a ""sponsored"" account that gets an equipment discount. The manager wanted to sell it to someone who would pay full price! Good luck! ...msg",negative,neutral,0.24130881793593964,0.7149459710660615,0.043745210997998885

"The case is well made, but I guess I was a little rough on the belt clip. This case comes with a really nice belt clip that has a flap that actually clips over the belt clip, making sure this case does not come off your belt. It is a rather ingenious little design, However, After about 2 months, the flap detached at the seam, and then the piece of leather sewn to the pouch to hold the belt clip in place, came off. Basically leaving the case useless for wearing on a belt. I bought this becasue the $25 case I bought with the phone began to wear out and the metal rivet holding the belt clip on to the case began to chaffe the touch screen on my phone.

"I previously had the LG Shine, I really liked the phone but my 2 yr old broke it. It didn't break my heart because I really wanted a phone with a qwerty keyboard for texting, and I was eligible for upgrade. Since I was very pleased with the Shine, I decided to stick with LG and go for the Vu. I am VERY displeased with the camera on this phone! Everything is blurry, unless you are able to be perfectly still and in perfect lighting. I have adjusted settings, nothing seems to help. If someone can offer tips, it would be appreciated. The Shine had an excellent camera, that even had flash. Having a toddler, I love this feature, it assures I don't miss any special moments just because I don't have my camera with me. The touch screen works fine and reception is good. Which are the most important things in a phone. Battery life is a little less than the shine, but the screen is bigger, brighter and the keyboard vibrates I would assume that would take more energy. I am also very disapointed with the ringtone capability on this phone. Ringtones that I was able to use before on the Shine, are too large to be used as ringtones on the Vu?!! Why would LG do this? Overall, it's a phone. It's good for talking and texting. If you aren't interested in the camera or having a wide variety of ringtones... this is a really good phone. It just seems that instead of improving on what they already had right, LG took a step back with the ""features"" on this phone. Can't quite understand that. This will probably be my last LG phone.",neutral,positive,0.00256678638823913,0.25061442258298644,0.7468187910287745
"Undoubtedly the best Bluetooth headset I have ever owned, everyone I speak with has told me that it sounds like I am on a landline. Easy to use and holds a charge longer than my previous headset (Motorola 700). I work from home and am on my cell phone most of the day conducting meetings. The conference call sound quality is incredible, I have had multiple office locations linked through my phone (Cingular 3125 Phone) using this headset and everyone could hear me crystal clear. Some have said the on/off button was difficult, however I find it to be and intelligent design. It is in a location that makes it nearly impossible to accidently turn it off, while on a call. The volume control is easy to use and the over all sound and volume quality is excellent. The only down fall is that it is so comfortable to wear that you forget it's on your ear, I nearly wore it in to the shower. It also has a wind reduction feature that works great outdoors.

"Maybe I just received a dud, but I purchased this specific headset because I used previous models (H850 and H700) both before and was fairly pleased.

"I originally ordered a nuvi 600 series, and I fell in love with the product for its bluetooth capability. However, I recently changed careers and needed a treo phone for my work. When I tried to sync the nuvi with the treo 700wx, I was unsuccessful. In calling Garmin they said that if I was patient, they would probably be releasing some software to deal with the issue in the coming weeks. Well, when spending that much money, I'm not that patient. So, I purchased a car with bluetooth capabilty and decided instead to purchase the newest nuvi 200 for its simplicity and small design. When I got the product, it worked well for the first 24 hours. It then repeatedly locked up. I spoke with Garmin, and they instructed me to do a hard reset, which I performed. The product worked for about 2 hours until I parked in a parking garage. When I left the garage, it took about 10-15minutes for the nuvi to find any satellites. I have dealt with this same problem for the last two weeks. I am now sending the nuvi back to purchase a better unit with an antenna, the most likely problem with this nuvi 200.

As far as the advanced functions, I would definitely not recommend buying the product simply for those. I've tried using a few of the advanced functions.

"Yes, this phone is sleek. The buttons are hardly raised, and the ports on either side (for charger/earpiece and memory card, respectively) are covered by thin strips of plastic held on by some sort of elastic material. If you carefully look at these, however, they seem easily broken! Be careful lest you snap them off. Other reviewers have raved about the form factor, but personally I find this phone TOO slim! I feel I can't get a good grip on it while I'm holding it next to my ear, and I am quite afraid I'll drop it into one of the sewer or subway grates that pepper the sidewalks of New York - or worse, an elevator shaft! (A friend of mine did this with a flip phone!) Suggestions to buy a protective case should not be taken lightly. Battery life: I pulled the new phone out of the box, charged it fully, then used it normally (about 10 calls a day, some Music Player usage, Bluetooth on for 1/2 hour, mostly standby). I got a low battery warning less than 60 hours later. It died in another 12 hours of standby. Not very impressive at all, although it might take a couple of cycles of full charges and discharges to reach normalcy. Update: After a week of full charge/discharge cycles, the battery life has not improved at all. With normal usage, I get at most 72 hours out of a discharge. I can imagine someone using this phone to make more phone calls would experience an even shorter battery life. Thumbs down! Mac users beware! YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SYNC YOUR CONTACTS OR CALENDAR ITEMS. Just because it has ""Bluetooth"" does not mean it's compatible with iSync. As of this writing, no Samsung phone is compatible with iSync. This is due to Samsung's refusal to support the open-source transfer standard iSync uses (instead of a proprietary one), and not Apple's fault. OS X's built-in file transfer app will function just fine, but the phone does not give you access to the all-important contacts and organizer files, so tricks that work on other Samsung phones (like vCard splitting your Address Book items and transferring to the phone manually) DO NOT WORK ON THE T519. Be prepared to spend several hours importing your phonebook manually, or try saving to your SIM card from your old phone and retrieving contacts that way. Forget about using the organizer, it's trash, and mostly useless if you're used to the visual luxury of iCal to enter your appointments then syncing to your mobile. On the menu: although some essentials are truly buried (O alarm clock, where art thou? hint: menu-6-5-1), nearly every single menu item has a reference number! So, for example, by pressing Menu-9-5-1 you can quickly turn on or off Bluetooth from the main screen. This is similar to the old Nokia phones, whose easy-to-use interface I have long admired. The new-text-message and silent-mode features are also available at one click from the main screen (L and # keys). An annoyance: the dedicated T-Zones button on the main screen, although it's an issue with many T-Mobile exclusive phones, is still a user nightmare. It can't be changed to something more useful (in fact, no menu items can be changed), and clicking it loads the browser app, (which can take a few seconds to dismiss), taking you straightaway to T-Mobile's bill-gouging downloads center. Stupid. On the MP3 player: this seems like a late addition to the T519's software. It's feature-poor, and the phone itself gives you very few options for playback. Furthermore, you can use the phone for playback, but that's all it will do until you close the player app: messaging and playback, for instance, are mutually exclusive. And there's no headphone jack! Forget about plugging in your favorite Grado Labs or Sennheiser cans, you are forced to go with the included earpiece, meant for phone calls - and what a P.O.S. this thing is. It's one-eared (and thus, mono, obvs.), and the quality is terribly poor. Are you thinking of buying this phone for the player? Better you didn't. (Also, Samsung customer service could not name any compatible bluetooth headphones, and if you want more than a couple songs on the device, you need to purchase a memory card.) This is not to say it doesn't work well as a phone! But an iPod it's not. In sum, the T519 is a sleek little phone that should have been great but isn't. As with other Samsung phones, the presence of Bluetooth connectivity is misleading for Mac users, who are unable to use it with iSync. The Organizer and Music Player apps are feature-poor, but if you just want a phone, this is less of an issue. Menu complexity is not necessarily a problem if you take the time to learn numeric shortcuts for the things you use often, and a few oft-used items are one click away by default. To the reviewer who complained about the pink menu highlighting: this might be a T-Mobile branding issue rather than a gender-bias issue.",neutral,neutral,0.43047678906593717,0.5421193425125733,0.027403868421489536

After reconferming my address (which was correctly placed in the original order), I checked the UPS delivery website and with Amazon.

"I have been using the Q for about three months, and have been very disappointed with its ability to function as a PDA-replacement. It's not a good product, and Motorola took a lot of shortcuts with the interface. Things that annoy me about the Q: - Number lock. It doesn't automatically turn on the number lock when in a field that would typically have numbers (i.e., fields for telephone numbers, dates, and times). You have to manually switch from letters to numbers on the keyboard. - New numbers. If you want to add a phone number to an existing contact from your call log, you must manually scroll through the list of names, rather than typing in the same (and having the device search your contacts). - Lack of Notes. It doesn't have the Notes program that is standard in MS Outlook and other Windows CE-enabled devices. I use Notes for tracking lists of restaurants, books, and wines so that I have them when I need them. Not so with the Q. - Navigational functions. It's hard to get to the desired program quickly. For example, if you want to get to your e-mail, you have to go through a menu that lists all messaging functions (i.e., text messaging, multiple mailboxes). - And, just to reiterate, the battery and keyboards also have problems. Enough people have covered those issues already, so I won't expound on them. Some might think I'm being nit-picky, but I think these omissions in programming are unforgivable. Given the level of sophistication in PDAs/smartphones these days, you shouldn't have to work this hard to perform basic functions.",negative,neutral,0.39636428429306303,0.5234509405835154,0.08018477512342158

"Pros: *The product proved to be designed to tight dimensions, so your HTC Kaiser/ATT tilt will fit snuggly with no gaps. *case has a nice black paint job with a glossy clear-coat added. *The case is made of hard plastic, relatively sturdy & thin, yet it still remains ""pocket-able"" when snapped on the tilt.

This can someone be an eyesore & will be frequently commented on when you let other people use your phone. *using a usb/headphone adapter also offered by amazon has been somewhat of a challenge, the plastic case does not leave enough room for proper insertion of the adapter leading to the adapter to fall out if not held firmly & your music will start playing out of the phone speaker(this problem does not occur if the the phone has no case) *the seller of the item(so far only 1 seller is here for this case) took 4 days longer than the last arrival date stated by amazon. In other words it took over 2 weeks from order completion to receiving the product in hand.

"Purchased two Blueant Supertooth 3's for my Camry and Passat. Sound quality from the speaker and what the caller can hear was decent, although since this is my first bluetooth speakerphone, I'm not sure how this stacks up against the competition. Cruising on the freeway, a caller knows you are on a speakerphone, but can still hear relatively clearly (at least in my vehicles). Setup was a breeze - took me less than 10 minutes to sync my contact list with my 2 phones - a Verizon LG Chocolate 3 and Verizon LG Dare. You have a choice between 2 English voices, and a few other European languages. Automatic pairing works as advertised, provided that the last phone connected is the one to be paired next. I also liked the magnetic visor clip - a nice touch when you need to detach to charge. Package includes both an AC and DC charger, which is nice. Unusual for an electronic product, the unit comes with a 2-year warranty, although I have not used it yet (and hopefully never will) to test its true usefulness. Now the cons. The biggest one for me is the inability to automatically pair if the phone was not the last one connected. This is not an issue if you are using just one phone. But if you have 2 phones (you drive one day, your wife drives another), this is a major inconvenience. Even if the last phone connected is turned off or out-of-range, and another phone enters range which was previously sync'ed, it will not find the phone. You have to manually connect through your phone menu. Another major setback is the inability to consistently announce the contact name if the contact has more than one number. So one number will result in the contact name being announced, and the other will result in the number being read. Why doesn't Blueant know that a contact can have multiple numbers? There is a possibility that this is a phone or carrier specific problem - again, I have a LG Chocolate 3 and LG Dare both on Verizon. Minor gripes include a 2-3 second delay in announcing terminated calls after pressing the red button, and the lack of customization when it comes to the voices and alert sounds. After living with the units for a few weeks, I would give them so far a solid 3 stars.",neutral,neutral,0.201455189670217,0.4820080622421739,0.3165367480876091

"I was hoping for a little more when I upgraded my old Motorola headset for this one. Here are the pros: - Fits snuggly in your ear with two different sizes of earpieces and a comfortable ear hook - Pairs easily with my phone and I like the one-touch auto pair feature - Volume is good and clear - Looks very professional And here are the cons: - Battery life is way less than advertised. My motorola can go days without needing a charge and it seems like a day of the same amount of talking with the BlueAnt eats up the battery - When the headset is running out of battery and you are using it, it lets you know it is going to die by beeping and dying a few seconds later. I would have liked a little more notice. - The noise cancelling for wind doesn't seem to work that well. I was trying to use it while cruising on my bicycle and the person I was talking to said they couldn't hear me at all. All they could hear was the wind. All in all, I like the product mostly because it fits better and is more secure than my old headset. But, as far as performance goes I don't think it is any better.

I'm pretty disappointed in my Hardcase SE... Two major complaints: 1. The case isn't that hard. It is plastic and feels pretty cheap. 2. The palm must be removed before syncing.

"Overall, I would recommend this product but it could certainly be much better. I've found it useful enough times that I'd bet you'd get your money's worth out of it. Just be prepared to get frustrated on occasion. Pros: 1. The sound quality is better than I expected. It's not amazing and other reviews have given accurate assessments of the sound, but there's only so much you can expect out of a little portable. It's certainly good enough to have around the pool or campfire. 2. Sturdy and nice looking form factor. This isn't some cheap little plastic thing with mismatched parting lines and flimsy connectors. Cons: 1. Annoying to pair. I'm really sick of critical functionality being buried inside of a single button. Changing the action of a button depending on how long you press it and what intermittent feedback you get back is just dumb. Charge a few extra dollars and put dedicated buttons. Oh, and label them for the hard-of-thinking (ie, make sure you've got it working before you break out the drinks). 2. The case has no spot for the cable. For any real length of time, you're going to need to have the ac adapter plugged in. Unfortunately the form fitting bodyglove-ish case has no way to store it. I've left it in the wrong bag, rendering it useless, at least 3 times. 3. Short range. Perhaps I really was pushing the useful limits of blue-tooth for streaming audio but I felt like you could only have it as far away as you might with an audio cable you might have lying around. Of course, you would then have a cable running through what is likely to be a high traffic area... so I still prefer the wireless option. 4. Annoying to use on Windows Vista.

The H710 cost twice as much, but seemed well reviewed, so I opted to grab one, and I am very seriously regretting it. The whole thing came in unsealed generic packaging, with no motorola logo or name anywhere on the outside, though it did have a manual and the earpiece has the logo. I wasn't exactly filled with confidence that this wasn't some sort of knock off (though it would certainly explain my experience). First off, the sound quality is only marginally better than the H670, but the range is equally bad - if the phone is anywhere farther than 3 feet away, the signal gets pretty bad. The microphone seems to be better, but the too-clever flip out design makes it a pain to shut off the earpiece while you're wearing it. To make matters worse, it's small, far to small for my comfort. I wear the default size earpiece for the H670, and the 710's earpiece is basically the size of the small, so it's very uncomfortable, and it offers no means of adjustment or alternate clips, so I basically had to bend the plastic to make it fit. Lastly, it uses a flattened version of the USB charger, rather than true mini-usb, so my existing chargers were rendered useless. Frustrating and disappointing. I had been really, really pleased with the bang for the buck I had gotten from Motorola's cheaper headset, and that had earned a lot of goodwill for the brand. This headset has, I'm afraid, pretty well obliterated that goodwill and sent me back to my old headset while I look for a better option.",negative,neutral,0.15048588188988377,0.8250274282904431,0.024486689819673255

"I got this so that my wife could talk to family after having our first kid. I knew that she would want to talk to her sisters and parents a lot, especially when I have to go back to work. I also know that while the baby sleeps, she will also. Therefore she had to be able to talk and take care of the baby at the same time. Not easy with one hand! The wired headsets would not have work well, as infants will grab and pull on anything they find. So far we are both very happy with this headset. Voice quality for the other caller is better than with our RAZR phone. We just took off the ear hoods and use the boot shaped ear piece and it stays in place well enough for our use. Overall we are very happy with it. EDIT: After using this headset for a while longer, I would no longer give it such a high rating. It sounds fine still, but quality and comfort are sub par. The little rubber ""feet"" that fit into the ear tend to come unglued from the earpiece, witch makes it hard to keep in place. Since purchasing this headset for my wife I bought this one for myself: http://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Bluetooth-Headset-Retail-Packaged/dp/B000WJ8P38/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=wireless&qid=1246038598&sr=8-1 Both my wife and I like this one much better. It sits on top of your ear instead of in it, and the quality is much better. The sound is about the same as the Jawbone. It also turns itself off whenever you close the boom, so the battery lasts much longer than the Jawbone.

"I upgraded to the N75 from the Nokia 6230; I'm a big fan of AT&T service on Nokia phones. In general, I'm happy with the N75. It is certainly cram-packed with features; bluetooth, phone, mp3, fm radio, some organizer features, a scaled-down version of adobe and real player, external memory card is hot-swappable and very easy to access. Many phones require you to open up the device and remove the battery to access the memory card which resets the internal clock and date. I haven't experienced a poor battery life the way some other reviewers have, maybe I'm just lucky. This phone has just about every feature you can think up without having to go to a blackberry-type form factor, and I really wanted a flip phone rather than a bar phone. My main complaint is the processor speed and performance; whenever you want the phone to do something, there is a noticeable delay, up to a couple of seconds, and there is a slow reaction to the keypad buttons such as transitioning from phone mode to camera mode, etc. If there was a faster processor in the phone so that it responded more quickly I would have no complaints.",neutral,positive,0.05119443692821014,0.3599135350094902,0.5888920280622997

"Finally I now have wireless audio streaming from my phone to my car. I will say that if you have the option an aftermarket radio with built in bluetooth support would probably do a better job, but if you can't or don't want to buy a new radio this is a great solution. I have used this device with two phones, a HTC Touch Pro (Windows mobile) and a Nexus one (Android) with very different results. # The Nexus One works extremely well with this device. Both music and navigation both play over the speakers with very high quality, you can even stream Pandora with it. I would assume calls will play over it and the remote works because they are both in the device specs, but I have not used those features. # The Touch Pro was a completely different story. The dynamic range of the audio from the Touch Pro was absolutely horrible, if I had to compare it to something I would say try listening to a 28kb/s mp3. After hearing the quality I gave up with this device, other users with the same or similar phone might have varied results. I would say this device is made extremely well, it can receive high quality audio and it has a convent USB port for charging your phone. It has a very short (about 3 or 4 inches if memory serves me correctly) audio cable with a nice woven exterior and a matching extender, in case you need a longer cord. If your cigarette lighter port turns off with the car when you turn the car back on it will automatically turn back on and sync with the phone in 2 or 3 seconds. And it is very easy to set up and use. But, you should be warned that depending on what phone or device you have the audio quality could be anywhere between amazing and horrendous. For every review you read about the device having poor audio quality I would note what device they were using, most likely that device has problems with audio quality over bluetooth. I have personally seen how two different devices (both good quality devices) can have extremely different audio quality while streaming to the LiquidAux, and I would imagine that the problem would apply to any bluetooth receiver. All in all, if you need an external bluetooth audio adapter for your car, look no further. I highly recommend this device.",positive,positive,0.044451762194852536,0.2473382716503224,0.7082099661548251
"In February I purchased a Blackberry curve and wanted a bluetooth headset. Unfortunately I can't use the small ear piece blue tooth sets or the ear buds since they won't stay in my ears. After looking all over the local area for an over the head bluetooth headsets and not finding one I checked Amazon and found the Motor Trend MTBT09 Max 4x Bluetooth Wireless Headset, I called the Amazon mobile phone assistance group and checked on the headset to make sure it worked with my phone and the went a head and ordered it. I have a large head and the headset is too small for starters, the band that goes over the head was barely long enough. Once I had it on it the metal arm of the set felt like it was stretched and going to spring off My head any second. Sound quality for me was fine, but half the people I talked to either couldn't hear me well or I sounded like I was in a 50 gallon drum. The headset it self has an cheap plastic kids toy feeling. The one thing I didn't have problems with was talk time or stand by time, that was fine. Until about 2 weeks after I got it and then it refused to charge... I can plug it in and the charger is lit up, but the headset fails to respond. When you plug it in the small LED on the side is supposed to light up red, but nothing...

"I went from a first-generation Razr to this phone, so it was a definite upgrade for me. I don't know if I would buy it again unless it had a few more items for the same low price. But I love the color and QWERTY very much. Being an avid texter, that keyboard is great. I love the fact that you can put in a micro card and get your items without paying a data transfer fee (I refuse to pay $1.99 per image). Since no card or USB cord comes with the phone, I bought them here from independent sellers (unfortunately, the USB cord isn't recognized by my computer and the San-Disk card had a bad adapter, so I'm 0 for 2 with sellers here). The pictures are really promising but the video quality is just as bad as my Razr. The alarm has a mon-fri setting, weekends, daily, etc. Definitely nice. But the volume on the alarm is the same as the volume for calls and you can't change it just for the alarm. I have a loud volume while at work, but that same volume sounds like a nuclear weapon when you're asleep at 6am. And on that subject, there is no ""quiet"" ring. It goes from loud to vibrate, to off. Since when does the lowest setting still mean ""loud""? The book included is practically useless. I still cannot figure out how to answer call-waiting without hanging up on both people. The little symbols on the screen have no definitions, so I have no idea what they all mean. It could be telling me I'm on hold with Pakistan and I'd never know. After hating on the book, I realized that what ISN'T in there is stuff you CAN'T do (novel concept) like changing the time. WHY? Why can't I decide to program my phone 5 minutes fast, or exactly the time of my child's school bell? Irritating. I almost returned the phone for that exact reason. No speakerphone with the clamshell closed. And the speaker will stay on afterwards unless you manually turn it off- closing the clamshell doesn't turn it off. It is easier to make a peanut butter sandwich while driving than to make a hands-free call at the wheel. I haven't found the shortcuts to calling someone while the clamshell is open (see ""useless book"" above), so I use the voice command. That little feature does work well. So on that note, USING SPEAKERPHONE WHILE DRIVING. Since this is apparently not only my bane, but others too, here's what I do: push the CLR/microphone button on the keypad (you can hear the voice command with the clamshell closed), tell it whom to call, and then after a second or so, open the clamshell. I'm sure there must be a better way, but the book... well, you know. The keypad lock is very poor. You need to push the OK button to unlock the phone, but this button is in the center of the keypad and the same height as all the others. My dog laid on the phone one day and managed to call people. I'm afraid to put it in my purse or back pocket lest it call Pakistan without me knowing it. I didn't have to enter a password when calling my voicemail with my Razr, so having to do it now stinks. You have to press # after the password, which requires more than a few keystrokes with the clamshell open. So checking voicemail via speakerphone is terrible. I think LG wants to get all people hands-free whether they like it or not. Whomever positioned the camera lens where it is needs to go back to school. My finger is in so many pictures I feel like a painter. But the camera does come with different settings that are very nice (the nighttime setting made a huge difference on some of my photos). I pretty much wanted a QWERTY and good picture quality. I got both of those. The sound quality is good, so overall I like it ok.

"Searching The Internet for details on Bluetooth wireless headsets with microphones, I ran across a ""You Tube"" Bluetooth Audio Radio Interface--a review by ""Randy,"" an amateur radio operator whose FCC Call Sign is K7AGE. Video and audio show how well it performs. K7AGE reveals how it sounds to other ham operators compared to his radio's regular microphone. I heard no difference. I ordered the B250 via Amazon as a result of K7AGE's demo. It came from an outside merchant, Payless Distributors, and was a smooth transaction with fast delivery. J&R Music World now has them, & my experience with J&R also is super. It goes back to the 1980s when I ordered a huge Sony console TV from them that arrived quickly and perfectly. I rate both merchants & Blueparrot with the top score whether your need is sophisticated, as in FM, AM and SSB communication used by hams; commercial application on two-way radios with PDs, SOs, fire departments, or for wireless connection to your cell phone. Handsfree may mean the difference between life & death. I've ""come close"" several times in my 40 years as a ham radio operator because it's dangerous to hold only one hand on the steering wheel, the other on a microphone, & divert attention from road to radio. Many states may outlaw mobile cell use that is not handsfree. That's probably a good idea.(Look up JABRA A-210 if your device has NO Bluetooth capability.) I rate both highly, and the K7AGE ""You Tube"" show allows you to see & hear it in action. I've not tried the Blueparrot on my Apple Iphone because it & my Dodge Magnum SRT-8 already have BT. If it works great through K7AGE's & my ham gear, too, there's no reason that it shouldn't be equal or better via cell. Blueparrot's most keen feature for the price is its ability to null background noise. That quality often is limited to expensive pro microphones, such as those made by Heil Sound, one of the top names. It's unique to find an inexpensive microphone-headset combo that performs this well, let alone one that also contains Bluetooth circuitry. It's even safer because it covers only one ear.

"Ok, let's get this straight. Just because a phone drops calls/won't dial successfully, doesn't make it the phone's fault. Cingular may claim that they have the least dropped calls but most of the problems occur when Cingular won't even let you dial out. Call QUALITY is based on the phone, not dropped calls. PROS... The phone is aesthetically built, and looks very nice. I like the functions available to the user without even opening the phone (flip style).

I have to agree with a previous 1 Star review. I purchased this so that I could use a 2.5 headset with my Tour. You can barely hear a thing even with the volume turned to max.

A few quirks: I can't feel it vibrate. I can *hear* the buzzing, but I can't feel it. That's inconvenient and annoying. Also, as someone else mentioned, you have to 'unlock' it if you wish to use it without sliding it open. Now, that's good for avoiding accidental button-pressing, but it should be user-configurable. Lastly, there is a limited number of menu items that can be assigned to the 4 user-defined keys. I wanted to assign one of the keys to To-Do application, but was unable to do so.

"I researched this headset quite a bit before I bought it and read that it is about the best bluetooth headset out there. So far, I think the headset is good but I have had some serious problems with it. I am using this headset with a Motorola Razr V3. Firstly, it loses connection for no reason about once or twice a day while the headset is on my ear and my phone in my pocket. I keep it charged so I don't think that is the problem. It's weird because I can almost walk to other side of my house away from the phone and not lose connection. Second, it does not work that well outside if there is even the slightest breeze. People say they can't hear me so I cup my hand over the headset and that seems to help. Third and most importantly, the clip that holds the gel earpiece broke yesterday and I have only had this for 37 days. I have contacted support and am waiting for a reply.

"I bought this at the smallest ""top of the line"" Bluetooth headset, not have used a BT headset. Before. While it was comfortable and I could easily navigate the features, I had two complaints that made it impractical and useless. 1) My primary complaint is that it does not stay synced with the V3. I am not sure if this is an issue with other phones, but I will say that with my wife's v551, there seems to be no problem. When the headset is not engaged in a call, it disconnects and reconnects every minute or so, giving me the annoying static in my ear every time it connects. I didn't think this should be a problem, since both products are made by Motorola, but even with tech support the issue could not be resolved. This is why I say in the title that it is not good for the V3. It might be fine with other phones, as my wife's v551 seemed fine. 2) The boom is too close to the ear speaker. I was told by many people with whom I was on the phone that they could hear themselves ""echo"". I could resolve this by turning down the earpiece speaker. That is fine while I am at home in my office, but if I was in the car, where there is more ambient noise, turning it down led to ME not being able to hear clearly. This is a problem that I had when I tried it with my wife's phone as well... so this is not really a ""fixable"" problem, as far as I can see. Both of these conditions were eliminated by purchasing the Jabra BT-250. While it is not as small and convenient to carry, it retained all the great features of the HS850, without the annoying problems listed above. Again, this may not be the case with other phones, but I have to give a VERY negative report with the Motorola V3",negative,neutral,0.25657691456437964,0.7264535532171658,0.016969532218454618

"I got this product in the mail quickly and charged it up. With a computer it charges fairly slow, but in an wall outlet it's pretty quick.

"The Palm Centro is my first PDA phone, although I have owned a couple other standalone PDA systems in the past. The Centro is not quite as convenient to use as a standalone PDA, but its small size and ""all-in-one"" concept make up for that. Overall, I would have to say that the value is excellent considering the low contract price (and price is important when you are a poor college student like I am), and I would recommend it for the most part. Pros: PDA with almost all functions I would want at a low cost Small size, can fit in most pants/jacket pockets easily Charges very quickly (to 80% within an hour) with original charger Palm OS synchronizes with PC Cons: Short battery life that runs out in middle of day with heavy usage Screen a little smaller than I would like Some people say that the keyboard keys look small, but I have had no problems whatsoever typing with it. It takes about one or two days to get used to. Not a problem at all. There are compromises for everything in life, including phones. The small screen and small battery come with the convenience of having a small unit. Obviously, you are going to get a smaller screen if you want the entire unit to be a convenient size. I solved the short battery life problem by buying an extra battery to get me through the day if the first one runs low. However, the pros greatly outweigh the cons for me, mainly because you get a real PDA (not some useless piece of junk like the BB or iPhone) that can sync with a PC. I can live with the slight inconveniences you get that make the phone a more practical product in general. In my opinion, this phone is better than the overpriced iPhone that can't even have synchronized documents, calendars, appointments, etc. with a PC. In the unfortunate event that my phone is lost/stolen, all my important information will still be backed up on the PC. That's what a REAL PDA phone does, not some cheaply made but well marketed phone that only seems better due to more attractive advertisements (BB or iPhone). I even bought a keyboard for this so that I could take notes in class with it without needing to bring my bulky laptop to class every day. I can just go back to my room, hit the hotsync button, and voila! I have the document on my laptop. Try doing that with an iPhone! (Sorry for the rant, but I believe people should do their own research and buy the better products instead of the more marketed ones) Conclusion: The Palm Centro is an excellent value as well as a highly versatile system. It has all the functions of the more expensive and desired phones, if not more. Unfortunately, Palm just does not seem to be as good at selling their products.",positive,positive,0.011842030875044292,0.48563325453886574,0.5025247145860899

The phone is great with two exceptions; the volume out of the built in speaker on the phone is too low when you are driving with your windows down or sunroof open and the phonebook accessibility is not great. I upgraded to this phone from an old Nokia that had decent volume and the phonebook was accessible by using the keypad to type the first few letters of someones name. Motorola does not allow that with this phonebook. You put in the first letter of the name and then scroll through the names until you get to the number. Not the most efficient method when you have over 200 names in your phonebook. I have been syncing the phone using OS X iSync (Address Book & iCal) over Bluetooth with no problems at all. It works great! All my names and numbers show up on the phone as well as my calendar which is a very nice upgrade over the Nokia which would not sync with OS X. I am going to get a Bluetooth headset and that should solve the volume issue.",positive,neutral,0.14326876868379973,0.4386328278860027,0.41809840343019755

"Product seems to be OK. As for probelms others have had, well chalk it up to internet buying. The clip is stiff and not easily accessible, but is does work.

I can deal with it since it was not very expensive, but it makes me think this is actually a knock-off or clone to a body glove.

1. The USB ports on the sides are spaced far enough apart that I can use all the slots. And the one in front is great for the thumb drive. 2. The lights are cool 3. It works great 4. It stands up most of the time! when I came into the office this morning it was on it's side but no biggie. I righted it and it was fine all day. The weighted base does make a difference and I think they made it as heavy as they could without taking away the portability feature. 5. Did I mention it works great. My laptop had no problem going to sleep. It was instantly recognized. All the devices I've put on it have been recognized 6. I don't know what one reviewer meant by it making noise. Mine is absolutely silent. 7. I agree you need a scissors or knife to open the clamshell packaging no biggie.

"Have no problem with reception, good clear reception. I do not like the way the center keys are in black which makes them hard to read. The bluetooth seems to cause other problems when it is on, outgoing calls connect but neither party can hear each other until I turn the phone off then back on to reset system. This happens fairly regular when bluetooth is turned on.

This is the second Motorola HS850 headset I have purchased and both stopped working after a short period of time. The very first Motorola HS850 I had came from a local office supply store and it worked for a very long time. These two I ordered through Amazon have been terrible. They both started out ok and each one stopped working. The latest one lasted one month. I can hear on my end but the person can't hear me. I won't buy another one. I will fork out the money and buy one from the store.

"I've had this up and running for about a month. It works somewhat as advertized - it seems to work really well at giving your phone a ton of bars (1 to 2 prior and now 4 to 5), but the call quality doesn't seem to match the signal strength. There are spots in my apartment that used to be completely dead, but now I'm able to at least place calls. The call quality seems to be only as good as where the antenna is place - not necessarly ""boosting"" the signal. Everything you need is in the box, which is a plus, but should be expected if your dishing out $300/$400 for something like this. If it wasn't so expensive, I'd probably sing a different song about it, but for the money, it's only OK.

I have an Ipod 120g and I bought this hoping that it would fit. Well as it turns out it does fit. I am so impressed with this product because I drive a truck for a living. I use the holder and an fm transmitter to keep me going when the radio gets too boring. This product is put together solid. The suction cup adheres to the window then you actually tighten the hold by twisting the base. The other thing that I really liked about it was the fact that it doesn't shack my Ipod. I could actually watch a movie on it in the holder and not have a problem seeing it. Like I said I drive a 10 wheeler truck that shakes and rattles a lot. Over all I would recommend this product for anyone who might even think that it will hold their Ipod,positive,negative,0.4612400680826743,0.26305960283987634,0.2757003290774494

"The sales transaction was smooth and effortless. Thanks! But the problems were with the manufacturing of the case. First the case's snap-on plastic covering didn't snap together with all of the latches catching. Two of the latches were not coming together--no matter how hard I pressed them together. I was afraid I might crush the iPhone internals if I continued. Second the rubber outer covering didn't fit properly into the plastic covering's side holes. One side was fine, the other side awkwardly and crookedly fit into the side hole, deforming the rubber casing. I returned the product to the manufacturer (at my expense) and they're sending me a replacement. Hopefully this was an isolated manufacturing flaw and the next one will be fine.

"Here is the lowdown on this product. I have no landline and only use the cell so I am limited to that use in this review. The good: The phone synched easily with my cell phone (LG Dare). Call quality was very good. Not noticably different than just talking on the cell phone. The handset has all the bells and wistles of a good cordless phone. The handset placed and recieved calls through the cell phone perfectly. No issues at all with that functionality. Worked flawlessly. Also the base picks up the bluetooth signal from up to around 25 feet from what i can tell so the cell just has to be nearby but not next to the base. The bad: Once its synched up with the system if you try to place a call (using the cell phone) without pushing the button on the base to unlink it the call will make the wireless phones ring and you will have to pick up one of the handsets to talk to anyone otherwise the person you are calling will not hear you and all you will hear is the remote handsets ringing. Also if you happen to be using your phone and you get within range of the base unit it will ""transfer"" your call to the handset and they will start ringing and you will not be able to continue on your cell phone (really sucks when it happens). Basicly once the bluetooth connection is made to the base your cellphone is only a conduit and cant be used for calling unless you manually hit the button to turn the base off for that particular line. You would then need to push it again to have it connected to the base. Also the manual is not that great. Something else started happening today. If I touch anything on my cell phone the handsets ring and to get them to stop I have to answer them, otherwise they ring in perpetuity. This happens if I go to check a text message. Even just going to turn off the bluetooth makes the handsets ring. I would not recomend this phone if you use your cell for anything more than calling. Summary: If you don't mind having to push the base button to use your cell phone separtely its fine. It would be a fantastic system if it allowed you to make and recieve calls from your cell phone or remote phones without having to manually turn the system on or off when the cell phone is within the bluetooth reception range. If you are content to set your cell down and do all your talking with the handset then this is perfect for you. If someone knows a way to keep the system from calling the handset when you use the cell phone without hitting the button to unlink it from the base then please post it here. Its driving me insane.",negative,negative,0.8045387347540963,0.1405998893537606,0.05486137589214303
"I bought this product expecting it to protect my Sansa, in addition to allowing it to be arm-mounted while running. In reality, the rubber is as thin as can be, and does not stand up to repeated use. After a couple weeks of using this product, the loop on the back that the arm-strap uses started to tear in the corner, and the small tear grew into a massive split almost overnight. Moreover, the rubber is extremely thin, and does not offer any real shock protection, let alone screen protection for the Sansa.

"I have had this phone in NYC area for about 3 months now. My wife has Cingular (RAZR) and I was going to get that phone as well, but then saw this one available at the Cingular store and figured I would get it for the looks, and Cingular said they support the phone so I thought all would be good.

Also, I just went on a trip up to northern Vermont, and my wife's phone never dropped a call or lost service (Cingular), and I had no service for the whole trip (Cingular), which was very frustrating trying to do business from the road.

"I have had this phone for one day. AT first I wanted to throw it in the trash. Here are my complaints: 1. The ear peace socket and the wall/car charger socket utilize the same port. For those of us who use an ear piece that is not bluetooth, you can not charge and talk at the same time. A big disappointment for me. 2. In order for me to save more than one number under a contact name, I have to switch the numbers from my sim card to the phonebook. Also another disappointment when I never had to do this before. I had the samsung e315 previously and this was never an issue. I never had any phone numbers stored in the phone book, only in the sim card. 3. Once you switch the numbers to the phone book to save into groups, all the phone numbers will not store in the group; only the first number that is stored under the contact. The good things: 1. The phone is very cute and very lightweight. 2. The sound is great. 3. The picture/screen resolution is crystal clear and very bright. 4. Once you figure out how to use it, the phone is great. 5.

"I thought I would post my experience with orderig this phone through amazon. I had many doubts, so I hope this helps a few people out. Here we go: I was a verizon customer, with an expired contract. I wanted this phone, so I switched to cingular. I also wanted to keep my number, but I wanted this phone more than I wanted my number, so I ordered it knowing I might not be able to keep my verizon number. It turns out I WAS ABLE TO KEEP MY VERIZON NUMBER. It is true this phone comes ""activated"" and they even sent me my new cingular number in an email before I get the phone in the mail. As soon as I got this email informing me of my new number, I called cingular, explained the situation, and there were able to assign me my old verizon number. They also said Amazon will NOT charge me to do this. Things were looking good. I anxiously watched the tracking information and I was pretty upset because it didn't update for three days. On the 17th of feb, I ordered the phone. On the 20th it said USPS was notified of a package, but hasn't got it yet. On the 23rd, it updated and said my phone was in my city on the truck. So the tracking is pretty lame, but in the end, my phone came in the mail two days BEFORE the expected arrival date, another bonus. I opened it up, popped in the sim card, and within 10 minutes, I was able to make calls. Accessing the internet is another story. I called tech support and they were really nice. We tired everything known, and after an hour I was told to take it in and get a new sim card. Great. I took it into cingular, and they worked on it for about an hour. It would work with the sim card from the store managers cell phone, but not with mine. We tried two new sim cards, and nothing. Finally, another person came to the rescue, recognized that it wasn't authorized somewhere in the system. We had to call a special data technical service and they activated it. It now works great. So after about three hours, I had my phone and I was ready to go. First thing I did was install google maps, everything worked great. I don't know if the problem was becasue I got it from Amazon, but it eventually got fixed and the phone works flawlessly. I have never had a treo before, but I really like this phone. The camera is weak, but everything else is very functional. I would give this phone 5 stars except.............. Next up, email. The push email client was very easy to setup. The problem is that it drains the battery life like crazy. It is essentially useless becauase the battery only lasts about 8hrs with minimal use (10 minutes, internet, 20 minutes talk time, 10 minutes playing with the contacts/scheduler) This won't even get you through the day. If you leave your house at 8am, your phone is dead at 4pm. Not cool. I did some searching, and it turns out the push email client drains the battery because it is constantly connected and sending information back and forth. Disabling this feature should increase battery life tremendously. Apparently the 8125 runs the same program without a problem, and because this is such an issue, they will come up with some kind of software patch. I am going to charge the phone tonight, turn off push email, and see if it makes any difference....i will update with results. UPDATE: Sorry about not updating, I forgot because my treo's battery is absolutely fine now. It turns out many people jump the gun and freak out about the battery life during the first week. After using it for a week and barely getting through an eight hour day, it seems the battery gets stronger and stronger. I also read to keep it plugged into the charger whenever you get the chance. It seems letting the battery run dry and then charging it is actually worse, so keep it charging as much as possible. After a week or two, I was able to get 24hours easily without charging. Just last night, I noticed my battery was about to die, but that was because I hadn't charge my phone in about 40 hours! So, bottom line: The battery will suck for the first couple of weeks, but stick with it and you will end up with a pretty sweet phone.",neutral,neutral,0.3956547080946685,0.5433286505570366,0.06101664134829484

"Beautiful, stylish, sleek phone. It's mis-marketed as a high-end phone, however. The camera is wonderful and the 2 music players superb. It's an American media phone. That is, heavy on the music & games, but not so great on the Internet. Motorola should've placed an operating system on this puppy. Nevertheless, the memory card is priceless. American carriers have found that Americans are willing to pay $20-30 MORE per month for a PDA so they needn't offer smartphones anymore. So, all of the so-called 'high-end,' non PDA phones are only high-end in the media department. The thing is, T-Mobile offers unlimited web browsing for a flat fee which makes smartphones a better buy than PDAs. High-end phones are media-rich and net-rich. This phone is only the former and, at that, has no FM radio. This is one of T-Mobile high-end offers, but isn't quite high-end. Anyone who wants a phone which is high-end in the media and Internet fields, but doesn't want to pay $20 extra for a QWERTY keyboard should stick w/ T-Mobile and purchase an unlocked smartphone from AMAZON. It won't come w/ an American service plan because Americans are forced to pay the extra monthly fee for PDAs, but you can do everything a PDA-er can, sans the keyboard. In fact, the Nokia N80 does tons more than ANY PDA on the market right now.... but it's 360 bones. This is a great phone for teens... stylish folks who want good reception and media.

"I like the idea of this phone but I'm questioning the execution. It works well...when it works. I recently bought a house and instead of installing a land line, I decided to give this a shot. The audio is decent, but the caller on the other end sounds ""distant"", even with local calls. The person on the other line was impressed on how well the call sounded from their end. Getting the cell phone to connect initially was easy. Not long after using the phone I started to notice that the connection would drop and reconnect a number of times throughout the day. The auto connect sometimes connect but most of the time it takes a long time before connecting. It would occasionally disconnect during a call. I've tried a number of different configurations (phone near base station, far away from the base, phone plugged in, phone not plugged in, all other bluetooth devices turned off, etc) to no avail. The cellphone I am using is VX5300. I will be contacting GE to discuss a resolution or get a list of compatible devices. As of writing this review, I would not recommend this device.",neutral,negative,0.780417527871409,0.20359427355646398,0.0159881985721271

"New Trent IMP52D charger is sleek and well designed. The smaller size makes if convenient to carry in a briefcase, purse or ""go bag"" for emergencies or daily use. It would be well suited for the business traveler with the onboard laser pointer and the white LED. Don't be fooled by the smaller size. This charger does the job intended. I have owned and used a Mophie in the past and found the New Trent much quicker and longer lasting than the Mophie. In addition to the good looks and size the IMP52D charges quickly with a wall charger and does a great job extending the battery in my iPhone. I am in the first duty cycle and finding the IMP52D adds about 1% charge to my iPhone per minute. As expected the IMP52D takes additional time to charge my iPad, but with the extra amperage draw needed to charge the iPad the extra time is not unreasonable. The iTorch has a great hand feel.

"Upgraded from a Razr v3 to this. It was a good move. The handling will take some getting used to (slider vs. other). You'll have to change the settings around to make the phone easier for you. But it has alot of capabilities. Drawbacks is theres a button for ""music"". What? It's great that it has MP3 capability, but I'll use my phone for a text message before music. I wish that button was for text or camera even. The slider is smooth. The phone is pretty solid. I have a feeling you can bang it around a little and still have it work properly. Battery life seems strong. Reception is fine so far. Buttons are smooth, although one big pad instead of seperate buttons. Overall I think this phone is very good. Once you get past the initial setup (IE setting your address book, hot buttons, text style, ring tones and volumes) and once you get past the sliding action (i'm used to a flip phone) this will be a seriously powerful and fun phone to use. lots of extra stuff like mp3, video and camera for those who like the tech stuff. but fully functional to use just as a regular phone like I do.

"We've had the Sidekick II for about two months. Although my 11-year-old likes it for its buttons and Gee Whiz value, I find it very awkward to use as a phone. It doesn't have a normal keyboard, so you must flip the screen up to press the keys, then flip the screen back down to listen and talk. When you get into a voicemail situation, you have to keep flipping the screen up to ""press 1 for English"", etc. Very annoying. You also must pay an additional $20 per month if you want to browse the Internet, use Instant Messaging, or even Download Fun. Otherwise, all you get is phone calls and text messaging (which is also extra). Even the non-sidekick phones let you get T-Zones for Instant Messaging as a $5.00 option. Another gripe is that the phone is falling apart after two months of not very rough usage. The screen no longer slips into place when flipped open and the letter ""A"" has fallen out. It occasionally just freezes for no reason. The first phone I received froze up the first day and had to be replaced. The battery is built into the phone, so you can't take it out to let the phone reset itself. No such thing as having an extra battery on a trip, for example. Internet browsing is cool, but so slow you think it stopped working. I think some of the fault is just the slow connection, but the other part of the fault is that the phone seems to take a long time to actually build the web page it's trying to display. Oh, yeah. Another problem is that T-Mobile expects you to pay $9.95 to set up your album on its web site, then 29 cents for each photo you upload to it. The phone is too large and heavy and has poor quality voice reproduction. You can't use wallpaper and the ring tones sound terrible.

"The capabilities of this phone are amazing. It will do just about anything you want it to. I recently upgraded to a nokia 8gb n95 from a blackberry pearl. I was worried at first because I was used to the versatility and functionality of the pearl but the nokia did not disappoint. Strengths: 1 Camera (if you are used to a bit slower image processing speed) 2 Video capture 3 Menu organization and capability- they are well organized and after a bit of getting use to are easy to navigate. Also the option tabs actually allow you do things, justifying its ""multimedia computer"" title. 4 wireless lan- made very very simple 5 Video player (real player)- can easily put multiple movies on the phone after they are properly encoded (hand break works very well, especially the mac version. 3gp converter and DVDfab platinum work well also. you just need to use the presets for Ipod not pda or phone as you would imagine) 6 battery life- is much better than I expected. can easily go all day with heavy use. after reading some reviews I was worried that it would not last long enough, but as long as you are not using the wifi connection and bluetooth all day long you should be ok. 7 radio! -I did not think I would be impressed with this feature but it works well and is easy to use. The only problem is that you cannot play the radio through the speakers of the phone unless you have head phones plugged in??? that didn't make sense to me but i guess its a small price to pay. 8 speakers- the sound that this phone can make is amazing considering the size. much better than any other phone I have heard. 9 NES and SNES emulation!!! I like to show this off to dorks like myslef . took a bit of reading but vnes works well. Vsun was a bit more challenging to get working and it also does not emulate sound=( but oh well. 10 screen- is very large and crisp. video and pictures look great. 11 Ngade games look good for a phone, but they do not play too well. If you want to play games on your phone, you should get something else. 12 TV output- comes with the cable, just plug it in and it works no matter what menu you are in on the phone and looks decent on a standard definition television, HDTV...watchable, but not really. 13 no touch screen!!! touch screens are a joke for anyone who types a lot on their phone. I had an Iphone, and i went back to my blackberry in a 3 days. buttons and functionality are much more useful. The internet did work well on, ill give it that. mediocre: 1 The web browser- is not as good as other devices i have used. Does not scale the page to fit the screen, so to read some pages you are constantly jerking the cursor from right to left in order to read a sentence, making it very difficult to read a respectable amount of material. The multiple page system is cool though. The history saves the whole page to memory so as long as you don't exit out of the program you can quickly jump back to pages past with a birds eye view of the whole page. 2 Speaker phone- is great when you can turn it on. the problem is that when you get a call and press the answer key there is a 3-5 second delay to when it gives you the option of turning on speaker phone. This poses a problem because every time you use it (I use it a lot) the conversation starts out awkward because the other person says hello (wondering if someone is there) before you. I guess you could just answer it normally every time then turn on speaker, its just that talking on the phone while driving is illegal in my state, so its more of a problem for me. Weaknesses: 1 camera lens in not protected 2 operating system seems buggy and somewhat unstable. The phone freezes at times when connecting to a computer, with the only way to fix it being to remove the battery. Randomly you are kicked out of menus and sent back to the home screen, although this does not happen often. Also it can be rather sluggish. browsing through image/video gallery can be very annoying because it slows way down, and skips around a bit. Transition from one screen to another is not very smooth, for example when the phone is idling and the screen is black it tells the time, but in landscape mode for some reason. When you open up the phone or get a call it will flash around a bit before showing you the main screen. I feel that the opperating system is the phones biggest drawback. Its just not very solid (crashed on me 3 times in the first day). 3 included nokia software- is garbage. difficult and cumbersome to use and don't even bother trying to encode video with it. It made updating the firmware fairly difficult. Even something as easy as plugging the phone into the computer via usb cable can be frustrating using the connect software. you have to deal with it though if you want to update the software or install any third party apps. 4 data transfer speed- is agonizingly slow. takes upwards of 15-20 minutes to transfer a 700 MB file, even longer if you use a mac. 5 GPS- is slow, does not work very well and not as intuitive as other GPS devices. It helps to be outside but it can be difficult to get a lock on at times. also you only get a 3 day trial of nokia's voice directions, after that you have to pay a monthly service charge. I did not read that anywhere before I bought the phone. 6 Email client- is not very good compared to blackberry. You have to manually go into the mailbox and tell the phone to receive new messages. You can have the phone do it automatically as often as every 5 minutes but it does not work in my case because I have to hit the acccept button every time it searches for new mail because the phone says it does not ""trust the cirtificate"". Lame. so what I end up doing is checking my mailbox periodically instead of only when I have a message. Some people may not have this problem but I do with an owa (outlook) account. all in all, the email client is overly complicated. Cant they just make it as easy as beeping when you get a new email??? 7 keys- Key pad is a little small for my fingers but I'm sure I will get use to it. It would be better if it was a qwerty keypad but I am sure I will get over that as well. Over all I am very happy with my purchase. It is very expensive but if you want the best you don't really have a choice right now. The bottom line is that all the features this phone has to offer is amazing, and even though it has some quarks it is still a great piece of hardware. You may not want it to replace all of your other standalone gadgets (GPS, Ipod, FM tuner,and camera) but it certainly makes for a good substitute if you don't want to carry all of stuff around (or if you just want to make your friends jealous it works pretty well too) What is exciting about a device like this is that it gives you a glimpse at what the future of phones has to offer, and from where I'm sitting its looking pretty bright.",positive,positive,0.05500689327344683,0.2830829464875672,0.6619101602389859

"I got this for $50 plus tax at Target on sale. It does the job as advertised. Hooked up to my cellphone via bluetooth and has been stable for two weeks. This allows me to set aside my phone but still can receive calls anywhere in my house, very convenient. One glitch I found is that the touch tone sent using my home phones does not seen to be delivered correctly over to the recipient end, thus company voice mail boxes and other automatic phone services won't work.

"PROS: - Small body - No protruding antenna - Nice big screen - Plays MP3's and allows you to make playlists - Voice Commands - Looks cool - Good signal so far, drops fewer calls than my last phone - Memory card expansion slot CONS: - Of the 100 MP3's I tried to sync, only half got transferred... and the rest generated generic errors. There doesn't appear to be any rhyme or reason for the failures. - The ""OK"" button is small and even after I've gotten the hang of the ""touch"" buttons, I frequently need to push ""OK"" 3 or 4 times before I get it to register. - Screen is unprotected. There isn't a rim around the screen edges or any other type of protection for keeping the face of the phone from getting scratched.

"The Motorola HT820 Bluetooth headset is a great product. Audio quality is surprisingly good and pairing with multiple Motorola phones have been simple. Range is also good as I have been able to walk around my living room and kitchen (~30ft) with no loss in signal. The button locations on the left and right side of the headset were great and actually very useful especially in answering calls and changing tracks when listening to music. There are a few things that I would like to comment on though and may be something that Motorola should consider. There is no audio adjustment (bass, treble, etc)and the unit borders on ""bulky"". Also volume is controlled not through the phone, but through the headset so maximum volume is somewhat limited. I was able to hear audio fine in the house, but it is very difficult to hear lower frequencies when riding in some cars.

"Comfort: My main problem with this headset was that it is not very comfortable on my ear. When I first got it, I couldn't wear it for more than 5-10 minutes. Now that my ear has become accustomed to it, I can wear it for an hour or so. It just takes getting used to. However, I wish I could rotate the headset without rotating the earhook like some bluetooth headsets. In order to have the headset have a tight grip on my ear (and not fall off), I have to rotate the headset so that it points upwards towards my eyebrows instead of downwards towards my mouth. It's not really an inconvenience per se, but it looks pretty uncool. Perhaps I have misshapen ears. Audio: The sound is fantastic. Only sometimes does it get staticky in my pocket, and not often enough to notice, at least on my end. Ease-of-Use: This headset was easy to pair with my Motorola KRZR and the main things I do (hanging up, answering calls, and adjusting volume) are simple and intuitive. Only problem is that if you don't hold buttons for the correct length of time, it can perform the wrong function. For example, pressing the call button once activates voice dialing, for 1 second redials your last call and 3 seconds turns it off. I've done my share of accidentally redialing. Battery: I was disappointed when I learned the battery wasn't rechargeable and it instead uses a AAA battery, but the lifetime is very long. It's supposedly 30 hours or so. I can't verify that, I just know I've been using it for two months now without replacing it, and it's just a regular Energizer battery. Durability: I carry this around in my jacket pocket most of the time and it holds up well. I do find myself accidentally turning it on when I lean against something, but I just need to be more careful.",positive,neutral,0.09770095226787485,0.6672086030955869,0.23509044463653817
"I recently made the upgrade from the i730 to this phone. I got tired of the i730 because almost every Nextel customer has this phone and it was hurting my eyes looking at it.

I like the new feature where you no longer have to go on the internet to send and receive text messages. What I like most about the phone is its internal screen.

"I'm a computer professional, and use a lot of other wireless technology for a variety of things - so I finally decided to get a BT headset for use with Skype (which I'm using more often these days). I've tried using this kit with Win XP/SP2 and Mac OS X 10.4.4 - and have toyed a little with it in Linux. I got suckered in by this kit in a store (headset + dongle), and figured I'd give it a shot, after checking out many favorable reviews of the H500 online. Unfortunately, the reviews I read were all about how it works with BT cellphones - I should have dug deeper. The headset itself works fairly well - sound quality on my end is decent, volume is usually fine (depends on both sides of the call, of course), and battery life so far has been great. However, every single person I've talked to has complained of a background ""buzz"" that sometimes makes it difficult to hear me. Also, they note that every once in a while the sound ""hiccups"", and they hear a repeat of something I just said (ie they hear the same bit twice in a row...and then it skips forward a few secs to catch up with me). I've tested it out a bit with the Skype test account system (""Echo123""), and heard the problems myself... Since I've been using Skype for a couple of years now (with wired headsets) with no trouble, I'm fairly confident that it's not related to Skype itself or my computers... I originally suspected the cheap USB dongle (Moto PC850), but my Mac laptop has a built-in BT card, and it has the same problem - so the trouble must be either with the headset itself, or how it all works together with Skype. So it's back to reading reviews for me, to find another solution. I definitely recommend against this ""2-in-1"" kit - save yourself the time/hassle and grief and get separate (better quality) pieces.",neutral,positive,0.22306635482516118,0.2240307315339123,0.5529029136409265

I resewed it by hand to make the repair, but I redid the top seam too because the stitching from the manufacturer was also pulling loose and is only just adequate instead of being stronger than necessary.

"I've only had it a couple of weeks, but it's been so nice to not have to worry about my battery dying mid-day anymore. I can go two, two-and-a-half days now on a charge. I use my phone mostly for texting and web-browsing, some email, some Google Maps and Sky Maps, as a flashlight, a few non-intensive games; not a lot of phone calls. But with my old battery, same usage, I felt like I was doing pretty good if I still had 20% battery by the end of the work-day at 5ish. The phone is now heavier, but not by a great deal. I tend to carry it in my front shirt pocket, which tends to cause my shirt to sag (but for me, function tends to outweigh form), but that was true of my old battery, too. It's also a little thicker, too. So when I bought this battery, I also bought the case ($7-8-ish) that fits it, which I use some times, but I still tend to keep the phone in my shirt pocket a lot. With the battery came a back cover (that does not have the NFC antenna in it, so NFC doesn't work; I really like the NFC feature, but don't find it easy/convenient/practical enough to use it enough to make its absence noticeable to me, at least so far), and a ""case"" that covers the back and sides of the phone. I was surprised to find that included; I guess I didn't notice it in one of the product pictures, even though it's there. If this battery lasts, in good condition, for as much as a year, I will be completely sold on this product, and will likely remember the name ""PowerBear"" the next time I need a battery. I offered to buy one for my wife, but she doesn't want to lose her cute pink case (for her, form tends to outweigh function - pfft). So while she wears out charging cables (and then taking mine - arg) fighting to keep her battery charged, I just go about my day, smug in knowing that I'm fine with whatever charge I have until I can manage to get to a charger later in the day, or maybe even tomorrow.",positive,neutral,0.020955316728262466,0.6741604506412793,0.3048842326304582

"I had this phone for six months before I had to throw it (metaphorically) against a wall. The phone has all the pieces to be a great device but seems carefully designed annoy. Caveat: I'm kinda a power user; if you just want a camera phone with a moderately useful addressbook, this product should do you fine. The biggest annoyances: * the location of the camera button. Inevitably, every time I took the phone out of my pocket it would be in camera mode, often with a couple pictures of my pocket. This means that every time you want to use the phone you first have to exit camera mode -- which completely negates the convenience of the little spring-loaded lid. * the interface. Nothing is consistent. Configuring one-touch dialing is completely separate from the address book is completely isolated from setting the ringtones. Having figured out how to configure something, it always took many minutes to remember how to change it. * synchronization. Don't use this phone if you have a computer. Not only was it painful to set up (I'm pretty technical, and synchronizing this phone with the Mac is not for the faint of heart), but the phone actually changed some data (moving addresses into the ""notes"" field). Seeing that was when I decided the phone had to go. This phone is marketed as a low-cost competitor to things like a BlackBerry or a Treo, but anybody who really wants an organizer on their phone would be poorly advised to use a Nokia.

"I am very disappointed in this case. Having previously owned Body Glove products and accessories for my phones, I automatically purchased this case for my Voyager. After 2 weeks, the rubber coating on the front part of the snap on case started to peel off, then a week later, the coating on the back half started to peel off as well. Not only that, I noticed wear marks on the phone itself on the hinges where it comes into contact with the case when I open the phone. This is unacceptable as I believe a case is to protect a phone not damage it in the process. Another complaint is that if any dirt (I live in the mountains and take my phone with me while I horseback ride) gets underneath the front cover, it scratches the surface of the phone.

"The reason I bought the new trent charging device is because of the inability to typically charge my device while at work. I am an airline pilot and use my phone quite a bit to call operations and dispatch as well as the internet to check weather and gate status and anything else that is pertinent. Often times as the day gets extended due to weather I find myself with a dead phone near the end of the day and no way to communicate easily. In the plane there is no way to charge the phone so I needed a solution which is why I bought the New Trent device. 1. Devices charged with power pack: I charge a dell streak cell phone and occasionally an ipod touch. I recently bought an ipad but I have not used the new trent for the ipad yet although I am confident it is easily up to the task. 2. Number of charge cycles my power pack supplies: Since I only use this as an ""as needed"" charger I have charged my phone completely from zero to 100% two times. In addition to that I have plugged it in to charge my phone back up enough to continue its use. That has been probably 5 times or so. I have also charged my ipod touch from zero to 100% one time. 3. Frequency of usage: As mentioned it is an as needed basis when I find my phone is dying or has already died. It is not my primary charger for my phone but more a back up. I find that I use it maybe one time per trip at work which works out to maybe once per week or maybe a little less. The charger is the primary charger for the ipod touch. I use the ipod touch to record my flight times for my personal records and it sits in my flight case and when it dies the new trent brings it back to life. I find that I am able to rely much more on the new trent as I have used it and gained confidence. 4. Overall satisfaction with the product: Overall I am very satisfied with the product. One thing that I failed to mention above which is most impressive to me is the lack of charging that the new trent seems to need. When I bought it I charged it completely on the first day. I have since used it over the last few months to complete the charges mentioned above and the new trent still shows greater than 50% charge without having been recharged. This is a huge asset to me since I can simply leave it in my bag and not worry about. The product would be useless to me if I needed to worry about it being charged as much as my phone. I simply reach into my bag and grab it and know its ready to go. I am to the point where I am going to charge it just for the heck of it since I don't want to forget about it as it appears to never need charging. Granted I only use it as an emergency back up but I am still very impressed. Another thing to add is that out of the box it can NOT charge a dell streak. I do not hold this against the device but more against dell. Dell has a very unique charger on their streak and although it has a USB end it simply is not plug and play. When you plug the USB into the new trent it will do nothing. After some research on a dell streak forum I was able to get it all going. I bought a 4"" USB extension online and followed the instructions per the forum. This got the new trent charging my device perfectly. This is not a negative against this product at all. They provide a nice array of choices for charging heads and dell streak is very unique in their charging situation and I could not expect them to cater to that one device.",positive,positive,0.049982473413078626,0.13222061037512506,0.8177969162117963

"We have used our Nuvi 200 for the past six months travelling in our motorhome and in our Jeep. My wife (The Navigator) and I decided that on balance, the Nuvi has been a negative to helping us navigate. Many times, the Nuvi is spot on, and we glide to our destination. However, there have been enough ocassions where the gadget is wrong and misleading, delivering unwanted surprises and just plain erroneous information so that, at the end of the day, the negatives outweigh the positives. We cannot trust it's route calculations without double checking with Microsoft Streets and Trips and with the Highway Atlas we got at Walmart. A good example was a recent trip thru Houston from a campground west of there. The night before we left, the Nuvi said we should bypass Houston via the Sam Houston Toll Road. The next morning, the Nuvi had changed it's mind and directed us to take I-10 through the middle of the city instead. We hadn't moved the motorhome during the nite, so we can only assume the Nuvi was suggesting the change in route because of the positioning of the stars, or maybe it knew something about gas prices that we did not, or maybe it just felt like seeing some different scenery along the way. The Nuvi has tried to send us down two track dirt roads without warning, which might be ok if we are travelling in the Jeep, but certainly not in a Motorhome, and I would not have wanted to go down those roads with a regular car either. We have been led down narrow, winding streets in search of an address which turned out was a mile away on the opposite side of the Interstate. Perhaps other Garmin Navigators are better and more useful than this one, but based on our experience with the Nuvi 200, we aren't planning to spend the money any time soon to find out.",negative,negative,0.475265998480414,0.325721939407424,0.19901206211216196

"I've had this phone for about 2 weeks now, and I'll have to say that I've been very happy with it. I've recently switched from SprintPCS to Tmobile, where I was using the sanyo 8100, a very similar flip camera phone (another excellent phone). It's a real eye catcher, very sleek and stylish. The user interface is easy to use and understand, and navigating from one screen to the next is pretty quick compared to some other samsung phones. Although the screen on this phone is probably the best among all the samsung phones, i feel that it is inferior to the screen on my Sanyo 8100, where the colors were a little more bright and vivid. The camera is excellent expecially with the flash, brightness adjustment, digital zoom, and all the other available options. One thing that my sanyo did that my new samsung cant do, is edit photos after they have been taken...but no biggie, i can live with it. The E715 is small the slim, and is hardly noticable when in my pocket. I love that there is no antenna, and the included head set is just as attractive and functional. The Self Portrait feature comes in very handy, and is great feature. The infrared port on the phone seems to be useless, so getting a data cable is recommended (it's cheaper to get them on ebay as apposed to getting them at large electronic retailers such as best buy or circuit city). The battery life right now is not that great (probably due to the juice draining features...camera, flash, etc.) but if u charge every night, you'd be fine. I'd recommend getting a car charger (try and find a retailer who will throw one in for free). But let's wait and see how the charge holds after a few months of use. The polyphonic ringer on the phone is excellent they sound clear and sharp, but too me the included ringtones attract a little too much attention...i wish it came with a little more ""normal"" ring tones. The E715 is a light show you can fit in your pocket. You can change the service light to be various different colors, or have it not blink at all. If you hold down the side volume button while the phone is closed, you can use the flash as a flashlight (It's been very helpful several times trying to get around in a dark room). The service light will also change colors in rhythym with the ringtone melody. Text messaging on ths phone is easy all though, I think Samsung could have made it easier getting to comma's, exclamation, and questions marks on the key pad. The included message alert tones are fun. Over all this is a fantastic phone, probably one of the best on the US market right now, especially if you are more concerned about form over function Summery - Pros: Small and Sleek Great Camera and camera options and settings Easy User interface and quick (enough) navigation through screens No Antenna Great sounding ringer..nice and loud. Strong Vibrate Lot's of included memory ( 9 mb ) Fun lights Cons: Useless infrared port Not the greatest battery life.

It probably works as well as any over-the-ear unit, but it was not sufficient for me. I replaced it with a Bluetooth that uses an earbud earpiece and I get along fine with that unit. If hearing is a concern for the buyer, I would not recommend the Motorola HS850. In every other way the unit performed as advertised. It was simple to pair to my phone and it picked up calls and transmitted my voice just as I expected it to. If I could have heard the unit, it would have been fine.",neutral,neutral,0.07412480326039413,0.8937781965750553,0.0320970001645505

"There aren't many case options available for the Lumia 800. I purchased this to replace the previous case I lost, merely looking for something better. I was to say the least, disappointed, and ended up removing the case after a few days and re-buying my previous case. Pros: Looks good Cons: Extremely hard to put on. If you have a full body shield on your phone, it can peel off while removing the case. Too hard, I can't imagine this case absorbing much of the shock if the phone was dropped. Buttons become excessively hard to push, also due to how hard the case is. Conclusion: If all you are just want to prevent scratches, and you don't mind buttons being hard to press, this case might work for you, but if that's the case, I would buy one of the <$2 (shipped) silicone cases. If you want something that actually protects your phone, I felt much more comfortable using the Tire Tread case by igadgitz. Not only is it a thicker soft rubber that will protect my phone if I drop it, the tread design makes the case extra grippy so it doesn't randomly slide out of my pocket or off a table.",negative,negative,0.8536285592610044,0.1075651888558329,0.0388062518831627
"After using this case for three months, I have to change my opinion. While the case does protect the Iphone, it also requires frequent cleaning and scratches my crystal cover that I put on . Overall, I'd say there has to be something better out there. I will keep looking . My original review: I wanted something to protect the Iphone and found the acrylic case to be fantastic. The clip is another story, it is awful. The slightest movement can send your beloved Iphone plummeting to the ground. Luckily the acrylic case works! When I contacted Contour Design, it turns out they redesigned the clip. Needless to say the new clip is not much better. Also, the acrylic case will not work with another holster.

"I purchased this at the local AT&T store as I needed a headset immediately when my two year old Motorola finally died. After purchasing two replacement Motorola H700s that worked for 3 weeks each and died, I was up for a change. A friend had recently purchased a Jawbone and told me her friends picked up her call from an airport, and they said it sounded great. That was appealing to me, so off I went. The 1st Jawbone was dead on arrival out of the box. It wouldn't light up to charge. AT&T cheerfully replaced it a few hours later the same day. 2 weeks later, the wire earloop, about the diameter of a paperclip, snapped where it goes through the main body of the Jawbone. They ship 6 in total, which are either right or left ear only. The second failed about two weeks later. The issue seems to be that the loop material is either too brittle, or to small in diameter in the name of fashion. The shape of the Jawbone is a little awkward to carry with you when it's not being worn. In a computer case, it can't really be flat, so the pressure from the side of the bag snaps it. The same thing happened when I put it in my jacket pocket. When I put on the seat belt in the car, it gently rubbed against the coat and number two was toast. The third one snapped in half when I was putting it on. One more thing - bring a friend or a mirror when you go to look at one. It pulls my ear funny, so it sticks out, which never happened with the Motorola. I am going to try the Blue Ant next, and see how that one fairs. For now, the Jawbone looks like a future good product, once they re-engineer the ear loops so they aren't so fragile.",neutral,neutral,0.2233392220035486,0.7670374673682662,0.009623310628185312

When I saw the demo video of how the Jawbone blocked out all of the outside noise I was impressed but skeptical. I along with 2 other in the office figured we would give it try.

"I got this phone as an upgrade from the Samsung e317 about a month ago. Overall I've enjoyed using this phone. It's solid as a phone, music player, and it's thin. The phone fits in my pocket nice and easy. Battery life for me has been average and the camera is ok. I like Samsung for their applications and ease of use, especially how easy it is to put it in silent mode. This phone continues with that tradition. It's easy to customize contacts with ringtones, photos, and change shortcut buttons. What makes this phone really better than my old one is the microSD. It's really easy to add photos, MP3s, and video clips to the card. I just use the adapter, that's included, to turn the micro into a standard SD card, and plugged it into my computer to add the files. Once the files are on the card it's easy to find them. You can tell Samsung focused on audio. There is a button specifically for the music player, which allows you to create playlists, search by artist, and albums. The phone comes with an adapter that allows you to use standard headphones but it's awkward, it does come with Bluetooth stereo capabilities, but I haven't used that yet. On the bottom of the phone is a speaker that I thought didn't work until one day I closed the phone while music was playing and suddenly music came out of it, which was a nice surprise. Also that speaker does playback MP3 ringtones and message alerts when phone is closed, I have no problem hearing the phone while it's in my pocket. When I first got this phone and saw it could play videos, I wonder what it would be like to watch videos on a cell phone screen. It turned out to be pretty neat watching music videos, movie trailers, and sport clips on it. It's great showing them to my friends. Battery life for me has been average when compared to my old phone, lasting about 3 days between charges. Perhaps that's because I use more of the multimedia functions like listening to music and watching videos. Also it takes forever to charge the battery. Another thing I didn't like was the camera and its rotating camera lens. It feels the camera responds slower then on my old phone and makes it difficult taking pictures of kids, who never want to sit still long enough to prevent blurry pictures. Once the camera snaps the final photo doesn't match what I thought was initially shown on screen. I tried to use the external screen as a viewfinder like my old phone, but I couldn't, so I'm stuck having to keep the phone open to use the camera. The problem with the rotating lens is that when it's rotated to face away from the user it reverses the image when the image is upright. To prevent reversing the image you have to take pictures upside down which is really hard to do. The up button on the side of the phone allows you to change the perspective of the lens.",positive,positive,0.003764170037115705,0.07692009513848667,0.9193157348243977

"I've used the Plantronics Voyager 510 for a few months and have been quite satisfied with the length of the battery charge, reception, volume, and ability for others to hear me speak clearly. The size of the headset is large compared to other headsets on the market and this is the only downside to this item. Other headsets may look ""sleek"", ""chic"", or more ""cool"", but if good earpiece volume and clear transmission of your voice is critical, this is the headpiece for you. If the size of the headset the goes behind the ear was slightly slimmer, I'd give it a full five stars. The interchangeable earbuds are somewhat tricky to remove once installed. That's the only other downside to this unit. Otherwise, a great headset. I enjoy mine a great deal. Update to my previous review (August 2010): After using this headset for over two years, I'm still fairly satisfied. The only problems I've had was one of the earbuds was broken off after I mistakenly put the earpiece in my briefcase with several items the pressed against it. Fortunately, there are two other earbuds included with the headset and I easily replaced the broken one. Also, after a period of time, I've noticed the foam cover for the earbuds tends to split at the seam. If you're purchasing this headset for the first time, it may be worth your money to buy and extra earbud/foam covers set. Another problem is the headset momentarily disconnecting with my cell phone, then connecting back. At this time, I don't know whether that is a result of problems with the headset or the phone. Otherwise, it has served me well and I've yet to have had anyone tell me that my voice was difficult to hear or understand while conversing in a variety of noisy conditions. Considering how long I've used this headset and it's performance to date, I can still recommend it to potential buyers. Another update to my previous review (September, 2010). Since my last update, another issue has arisen with this headset. The rubber material that houses the wiring and is the part that bends over your ear, has cracked in two areas. One is closer to the top (near the on/off switch), the other is at the end of the rubber ""tube"" just above the earpiece. At the latter location, the rubber is literally crumbling to pieces and exposing the wire cord within. This is a very recent development and seems to be a part of decay based on age. I realize after 2 1/2 years that no Bluetooth headset will look like new, but if this deterioration keeps up, a significant portion of the wire that runs from the battery to the earpiece/mic will be exposed. When taking the construction into consideration, there's no way to replace this portion of the headset. Short of wrapping the rubber in electrical tape (which would only give an unsightly and temporary fix), the only other solution is buying another one. But, that doesn't make sense since the item is still in perfect working order, has a great earpiece with clear sound, and I've yet to have anyone complain about the quality of my voice through the mic, even when I was in a noisy environment. Final update to two previous updates (September, 2010). The problem I wrote about in my last update has made me decide to never consider this model again. The rubber portion that fits over my ear literally crumbled into several pieces two days ago. Not only did this make the earpiece useless, but the wiring broke off from the circuit board that's in the piece that goes behind your ear. Long story short, don't buy this model and expect to get several years of use. If you're lucky and VERY careful in the way you carry, store, & use this item, you'll be lucky to get two years of use out of it. Otherwise, I can't recommend it since there are so many other models that are equal to or better for less money. I'll generously give it three stars...was tempted to give it only two, but the boom mic is an asset...noise reduction is better than average...but that's about all.",neutral,neutral,0.059240402618676094,0.9030907702143606,0.037668827166963334

"Like so many others, I am on a perpeptual search for the ""perfect"" Bluetooth headset. I want it to slip over my ear quickly, to fit firmly into my ear canal, allow me to hear clearly while I am standing in the midst of a roaring crowd and reproduce my voice perfectly no matter how lousy my connection. Someone on quest like this encounters a lot of disappointment. The Jabra 510 met some of these requirements, but not the critical ones. Hearing the other party often required pressing it into my ear and I often received complaints that I was difficult to hear. Many reviews on the Jawbone have been glowing . . . and some have been downright derogatory. I figured that I might as well try it. The design is visually appealing, but the earband is a piece of bad design. Apparently made of aluminum or some metal alloy, it is relatively inflexible and difficult to place over the ear. One point against. There have also been reports that these earloops are easy to break. There are only two buttons, both of which are hidden. One is relatively easy to find, the other requires a bit of hunting. This second button is also the volume control. Press it a bit too long and you've just turned off Bluetooth and lost your call. The visual indicators for status are sparse, so often you are left guessing as to precisely what status your Jawbone is in. I found that restablishing my Bluetooth connection, which I had accidentally severed, was way more difficult than it had to be. Initial pairing was flawlessly simple, but if you lose your connection while driving on an expressway, for example, trying to reconnect turns you into an accident waiting to happen. Received audio quality is pretty good. Using the standard ear bud, the fit was good, but not perfect. The volume control proved to be hit-or-miss. Sometimes pressing it as the directions specified increased the volume. Sometimes it broke my Bluetooth connection. I tested the voice transmission capability by turning up the television and radio at the same time and calling my own voicemail. I must tell you, the noise cancelling technology works very well. Voice quality is acceptable: we're talking cell phone audio here, not concert hall acoustics. The battery seems to last the specified times, but the proprietary charger connections are not only a bad idea, but stupid as well. While one end of the cable can be plugged into a standard USB slot, the end that attaches to the Jawbone is proprietary. This is just plain dumb. It should be a mini-USB. Instead you have to remember to pack yet one more cable. Is the Jawbone worth the premium price? Kind of doubtful. With other headsets, I've never been unable to complete a phone call, although sometimes I have had a hard time hearing and being understood. The Jawbone does make your voice more intelligible with its noise cancelling abilities. So I guess the determination would be how often you would need to depend on that noise cancelling technology. I am also wary of Aliph's customer support. Many Amazon reviews have remarked on poor build quality, breakage and very poor customer support by the manufacturer.

"Have been a loyal Plantronics customer for over 20 years - first PC video cards, then wired headsets, and now Bluetooth headsets. Had two of the 510's. They worked great for their function, but had to give up on them. Lost one, and used it's charger on the replacement 510 I bought. That original charger died - fair enough, just got out the charger that came with the new one. After a few months that one died, too. Figuring to side-step the apparent charger problem, I got the USB charger cable. Guess what - the 510 would not take a charge. Had to retire it and the pricey USB charger cable, and give up on Plantronics. Bought a new Motorola headset, and hope it works out - at least it's charge port is a mini-USB and not that strange thing Plantronics put on the 510.",negative,negative,0.6922309376025922,0.16558663269056692,0.1421824297068408
"I've been using this headset for about 2 weeks now and haven't had any problems with it yet. The volume is definitely loud enough to hear people on the other end, which is good since the another wired headset I have is much too soft. But it could almost use a slightly lower setting since when in a quiet room the lowest setting is slightly louder than I would prefer, but it is still a comfortable volume. People on the other end say that I sound fine and don't notice that I'm on a headset, but one person did say they noticed and I didn't sound as good. The headset hasn't had any problems connecting to my phone. The power button is a little hard to press, as others have mentioned. But as long as I turn it on before putting it on my ear, I have no problem. It takes a couple seconds to get it on my ear, so I've missed a couple calls since I couldn't get it on in time. Despite the little drawbacks, I think it is a great quality headset with excellent voice and sound quality, which is the reason I bought it.",positive,positive,0.00122578209758313,0.31635483234412626,0.6824193855582905

"GOOD: Very comfortable to wear for long periods (I never once needed the over-the-ear loop thing), sound clarity is fantastic even in loud places, looks very sleek. BAD: 1) Because of the lack of visible buttons, it's difficult to tell at a glance if it's on, linked to your phone, and if the battery needs a charge. You have to wait until it blinks next (or doesn't), and that's a long few seconds if you're in a hurry. I was constantly guessing wrong. 2) The part that's supposed to touch your cheek would often slip off mine as my jaw moved in conversation, and the person I was talking to would lose me, and I'd have to move it back; 3) After about six months of moderate use, it first got stuck in the ""on"" position (which screwed up the pairing and un-pairing after every charge) and then broke entirely. OVERALL: Worked great when it worked, but ultimately didn't justify its buzz and price tag, and I won't be buying it again.",neutral,neutral,0.4729276922888888,0.5211163715776139,0.005955936133497321

"This is my second Plantronics bluetooth. The first one is 510 which I purchased for my husband's Tmobile SDA, which we both love and have paired to both our phones. I just purchased this bluetooth couple of days back from a different store and not through Amazon. I did not see any reviews except for one so thought would share my take on Discovery 610. Very sleek and light weight. Plugged it to the power charger and in about an hour it was fully charged. The light stays red when the bluetooth is charging and when done the light goes off. I felt that the optional hook is a must as it doesn't have a firm hold on the ear without it, looks odd but is quite comfortable. I did not have trouble pairing nor making calls with my T-mobile MDA. The pairing was extremely simple and quick and have paired to two devices. The audio quality on both sides is pretty good. Does not have noice reduction so in quite environment it sounds very clear. The volume has to be increased in a noisy environment. The power button has multiple features, hold it for a while until you see the red light - this is for both on and off. The double click (two fast clicks) will redial the previously dialed number. You don't get a feel for the button when its pressed down so you have to hear the sound to figure out if you clicked it twice and the connections is in progress or not. I am yet to set up voice dial feature. Overall, I will recommend this bluetooth.

"I generally like this headset. It looks light and cool and has good sound, and since the earpiece is in your ear, this works well in noisy environments. It does pick up ambient noise, but I can't imagine how that can be avoided in a headset of this type. I had a Plantronics 320, and this one is better. I wouldn't buy the Plantronics again. It stays put with the proper adapter, and I am really active outdoors. HOWEVER - I don't like the redial feature. I can't hang this thing up without the darn thing redialing, which has to be an annoyance to your last called number. Not only that, it will redial if you hit the button accidentally. This WILL happen if it's in your pocket. This is a potential disaster. This gives your last caller their own eavesdropping device. Why they designed it this way is beyond me. I can't find a manual online either, which is inexcusable for Samsung. It's too bad that it has these flaws; otherwise I'd give it a 5. Update 2009: I finally lost this one to the wash machine, and for the last year or so, had the WEP200. The sound quality is better, but it hurts my ear. Even so, I am willing to endure this pain in lieu of the idiotic redial feature of the much-better fitting WEP410.

"I've had this phone for about two months now and have only two complaints: average to good call clarity (I'd prefer excellent) and a crappy OS. Call clarity is acceptable to good and volume is great. Battery life is average for a phone with this sort of feature set. It needs daily charging if you use it a lot. Only major complaint: The operating system blows. I've had a longstanding allegiance to Nokia phones, which has only grown since switching to Motorola and realizing that the Nokia OS is often sensible where Motorola's is cumbersome. But I didn't like any of the new Nokia offerings and decided to give Moto a try. Moto OS is to Nokia OS as Windows 3.1 is to Mac OS X Tiger, which is to say I won't buy another Motorola if I can find a phone by another company that isn't ugly, has good call quality and decent battery life, and has the features I need or want.

"I bought this product recently to help my long trip to Asia. I read a lot of good reviews of this product and was hoping that this product will help me enjoy my iPhone apps over the 14 hour flight to Asia. It worked fine without any issues on the way there from the US. However, on the way back, it was a completely different story. I had it fully charged to 4 dots before I took the flight. My iPhone battery % was low to start with. But I wasn't so worried because of this extra battery I had. About 2 hours into this long 14 hour flight, my iPhone battery was under 10%. So, I pulled out this battery and tried to charge my iPhone. But to my shock, I could NOT turn this on with whatever combinations of clicks. It was absolutely devastating with 12 more hours of flight to go. Eventually, I pulled out my laptop and connected this battery to my laptop using the provided cable. Magically this ""activated"" the battery (which showed 4 dots - fully charged) and I was able to charge my iPhone the rest of the way. I was going to regard this incident as a one-time fluke.

"This might not be as good a deal as it first appears, so watch out! While the phone is cheap, if you buy it from Cingular, you are locked in for 2 years and must have a minimum plan of $40 a month, plus $45 a month in Blackberry service charges. That's $85 a month!

"At first I was in love with this phone. The text messaging system is awesome, the screen is nice and big with a good picture quality, and the size is an advantage. It also can be very loud if need be, although that wears the battery down rather quickly. It also has the advantage of having a USB port for a charger, which makes the likelihood of having a friend with the same charger higher. HOWEVER, it's small sliding size makes it a little bit fragile. After having this seemingly perfect phone for two and a half months, it is doing some weird things. First, it loses service extremely easily, which it did not do at first. That wouldn't be so bad if the screen didn't also go white whenever this happened. Whenever it whites out like that, I can't do anything; I can't look at pictures, or my numbers, and if I'm working on a textmessage, it gets lost and not saved to drafts. It happens all the time. Obviously this is extremely annoying, and it would seem that the phone is either badly designed, or broken.

"I originally had a Technocel soft leather case for my MotoRazr V3 but wanted extra protection for an old phone that I love so much. This Technocel case arrived through Amazon in timely fashion. It is constructed in 2 plastic halves with a real leather covering. The plastic pieces snap over the original case and fit it very tightly. (Difficult to remove) A negative is that the original leather case had a plastic window to protect the Razr's front viewing window from damage from loose change or keys. This case has no plastic window. I will glue on the inside, a very thin piece of clear plastic which will give me the protection I am looking for. This case is much more heavy duty than the original but the tradeoff is adding 3/16 thickness to the phone which is expected. An advantage to this case is that there is no obstruction to the camera eye when the phone is opened up like my original soft case hinge strap did. The original leather case was too thin and provided very little protection to any side of the phone if dropped. The weakness in this case design is that the top of your phone has very little protection as there is no ""shoulder strap"" to straddle the hinge and give at least some protection to the hinge area if dropped.

"I paid the full list of $89.99 for this subcompact headset 5 years ago. It was the only one out of many I tried that fit my ear and remained in place without resorting to an over-the-ear loop. This headset has served me well over the years. It paired effortlessly with both my prior and current phones the very first try and has worked flawlessly ever since. It charges quickly and has around a four-hour talktime before it gives a low-power signal. The charger-cum-carrying case, which at first seemed a little odd, has made tremendous sense in the long run. The only downside to this design is that if one should carelessly misplace the case they would be unable to charge the headset, but over time the convenience and utility offered by this arrangement has been well worth that risk. Since the standby battery life seems to be several days, the headset, kept in this little case, usually resides in my pocket until I need it. Since it pairs so readily with my phone, I only turn it on if I need to conduct a hands-free conversation, and it connects almost immediately. If I use it during the day, I charge it in the evening.

"I've used this about two weeks now. It's great looking and durable. It stays put and works fine with eye glasses. The sound of the person you're talking to is great, perfect. But I've found they have trouble hearing me well. Part of the reason, I think, is because the unit must touch your jaw and face downward. Not every face is the same and it's almost impossible to get it to actually touch my jaw and stay in place. I've tried every ear loop that comes with it. I just can't get it to fit right and that causes it not to do it's best work. Moreover, when you are talking, the volume is always too low. So you attempt to get the volume higher and by doing so you disconnect the call in many cases. I probably would not buy it again and maybe I should have returned it. But the sound is so superior to any other bluetooth I've used. So, I'm going to try and get used to it.

I wish the volume was louder-I have it turned up all the way and it still sounds a little faint. The earpeice is tight and secure but it also pinches, so long calls are going to be uncomfortable.

I bought this for the price, the ease of inserting devices, its generality if i change phones or want to attach another device, and the long, flexible mount. I was skeptical about window mounts and wanted a vent mount instead, but my vents are vertical so I was forced to go this route. Ultimately I am very pleased with the purchase. I can use my phone's gps without dangerously looking in my lap and change songs/stations in internet radio without having to look down. The material is fairly durable and nothing has become loose or fallen apart and after around 2 months its still attached to the window. Update 1/2018: After owning this for about 6.5 years, the top portion of the clamp shattered in my hand when trying to close it around my phone on a frigid winter morning (using a rubber band to hold the phone to the . The suction cup has never fallen off in all this time. The winters here get down near 0F and the summers over 100F so the plastic must have become brittle in all that. At this price point and that many years I think its worth replacing with the same product. The suction cup has turned yellow from the sun, but still holds tight. The clamp doesn't like to grip very tightly, especially after so many years, but I don't think phones have ever fallen out of it.",positive,positive,0.09774721746499695,0.060624327909703984,0.8416284546252991

"saw the special deal on amazon so I bought it. The phone is alright but not at all what i was looking for. First of all people should know that the reason the phone is availible so cheap is that it isn't the US edition. Though it doesn't really matter, it is kind of annoying. The charger comes with a universal adapter and won't work without it, making the charger weird shaped and bulky. The other thing is that some of the menus on the phone are spelled wrong. The Good ~Battery life is very impressive ~2mp camera is not bad ~Decently customizable ~Comes with Platinum Sudoku The Bad ~The user interface was my main problem with the phone. Defult analog clock and wrong date format. the menus just don't make sense, things that should take one button to do take 3 or 4. Menus are grouped strangely and things like bluetooth are a pain to find. ~mutimedia is disapointing on almost every level, videos take a while to load aren't great resolution (176X144) max length is 30 seconds ~audio player is ugly and slow, with a just plain bad interface ~doesnt work with MircoSD card, or at least not a full size one, maybe I misread Overall not that bad of a phone, just not made for mutimedia by any standards, I for one will be returning it for the Sony Ericson.",neutral,neutral,0.31774167712597745,0.6752009144415937,0.007057408432428808

"I've purchased two of these phones over the years. It's been several years since I bought this one for my daughter. Personally I prefer the clamshell type of phone, but my daughter has moved on to the smartphones. Anyway, at the time these were first put out, they were amazing phones. Very sleek, very useful, tons of features. The only really annoying trait of all of the Moto Razr phones is that the glass is horribly thin and flimsy, and is very easy to break (both inner and outer glass). Good luck finding replacement glass for it - and when you do, expect to pay $15 bucks for it. When you replace the glass, if you don't position it just right, it's easy to break again, because it will be possible to put too much pressure on it. It's not possible to remove it and reposition it, because the glue is so sticky and the glass so thin, that you'll break it just getting it off again.

"I just returned my T-Mobile wing after a week and a half of solid use. It had a lot of strong points but some major drawbacks ruined the deal. First, those shopping for a device like this are probably looking for a fairly quick data connection. I'm sad to say that T-mobile just isn't up to par with any other, major carrier when it comes to data speeds. It's not a trivial kinda of difference eitther. Verizon has speeds on their phones that are nearly as fast or faster than DSL. With this phone it's barely comparable to a dial-up modem. Forget about Skype, forget about streaming video. It just doesn't happen at those speeds. From a business perspective this device is very solid. Windows Mobile 6.0 offers a few crucial changes over 5.0 but the applications are what won me over. It's nearly a fully functional desktop version of Excel in this bad boy. The version of Word is top of the line as well. Outlook functionality is stellar, and... it even browses Sharepoint sites (with some limitations). As far as the physical device itself, I have some gripes. When using it horizontally with the keyboard slid open, the screen feels very fragile and the device feels fragile over all in your hands when using it this way. I could predict that the sliding functionality would break in the very near future.. .it didn't feel sturdy in that actiona t all. The keyboard is virtually flat, which sucks if you are typing anything other than an extremely quick text. There is no 3.5mm audio jack, it's USB and Bluetooth only. That' sunfortunate because this thing is just about the right size to replace your iPod with, and with memory cards getting as big as they are it's not such a bad alternative. Plus the Win Media Player is very cool and very comprehensitve on this guy. It can be controlled from the home menu The overall feel of the device is great. The case is not smooth and plasticy, it's textured and has a soft feel that would obviously show fewer nicks and dings than your standard PDA. Also, just in case you wondered, the color is not as bad as it appears online. It's a very deep, dark, bluish-purple with a metallic sheen. I can see this device having serious merit for somebody with smaller hands since it isn't that much longer than a RAZR. In the end I sent the device back because it's Wi-Fi module failed. Let me tell you this up front... T-Mobile, not very good at technical troubleshooting. Wouldn't recommend you even bother. I made it through 3 levels of Technical support for the guy to tell me that it must be my wireless setup, despite the fact that my friend was able to connect with his T-Mobile Dash, and the Wing wasn't able to connect to ANY wi-fi connection after the first day. That's T-mobile though, I doubt you'll have success troubleshooting with any carrier on that note. The real story here is that mine was prone to defects within 48 hours of standard use. Overall, I'd recommend it. I'm sure they would have recalled the device by now if everybody was having the wi-fi issues so I guess that's a fairly safe bet. I wasn't able to find evidence of mass defect for wi-fi capabilities on the net. Make sure that you are comfortable with the feel of this device when it's open and the keyboard is in use before you commit to it!",neutral,neutral,0.09335451986056945,0.5054732700447236,0.4011722100947069

"The case fits my Palm Centro quite well. I bought this 5 months ago. The first 3 months it held up perfectly. Then the clip broke off the pouch, and I used the belt loop. That lasted 6 weeks, and finally that tore off as well. So, for an overall cost of about $5 (including shipping), this works out to about $1/month. My Palm OEM case ($20) lasted 15 months ($1.33/mo), and my designer case for my Treo before that ($30) lasted 1 year ($2.50/mo), so this is the cheapest way to go, but do not expect a long term commitment. UPDATE: After above case went belly-up, ordered a new one using the link from my prior order. Top seller listed was AccesoryOne, so that's what I clicked on. Just received it and noticed the case is completely different from my prior one. The case interior is smaller front to back (package says HTC Magic Case, which is a thinner phone) so my Centro needs a firm push on the flap to close. Magnets on the flap are weaker and don't keep closed as well (also probably due to the thickness of the phone). So THIS version is not good for the Centro (and is not the one pictures - although neither is my last one). Thinking back, I believe my last order was through Bargaincell, but I'm beginning to think this is just a generic listing and the individual places just give you what they are selling that month. Maybe safer going with a brand name, but this is cheap (if it works for you).",neutral,neutral,0.08990711681803874,0.865065207205089,0.04502767597687244
"This is a third headset I own. Bought it to go with the new Treo 750. I must admit, my own fault - paid too much attention to all the ""military-grade"" hype. This is the WORST of the three sets I owned. The last one, Motorola 850, I think, was WAY better. In order to have it even attempt to work as advertised, the white button on the side facing your face must be in tight constant contact with your face. It must be essentially compressed by your face. For that to happen, the headset must fit well and sit securely in/on your ear. Neither one of those things are possible, at least for me. FYI: I am no known for strange and unusual anatomy, including ears and the rest of my head! To elaborate, the earpiece (the one going inside ear canal) does so very loosely. That does help comfort, but it does not assist in holding the headset well-positioned. The worst part of design: the earloop--a flimsy hook-shaped wire that loosely hangs on your ear. That is the ONLY portion meant to not only hold the headset on your head but to ensure that it constantly presses on your cheek/upper jaw. Remember? The ONLY way this devise does it's ""military-grade"" voodoo is by sensing the vibration from your jaw when you speak. It then presumes that vibration corresponds to your speech and separates it from other noises in background. So... No tight fit from the headset hanging via wire hook on your ear means ineffective filtering, which in turn means people still can't hear you!!! Back to square one, except now I'm out of $115. That is not all. In order to position that hook around your ear, you engage the end of it behind the ear and then turn it in circular motion to wrap around as tight as possible, trying to establish a good solid cheek contact. Well, two weeks of that--each and every day--and the earloop hook snaps at the base, leaving you with the headset in your hand. I must admit, the manufacturer sent me a replacement right away and I received them a week later--free of charge. One week without a bluetooth headset, and I am back in business. It's a good thing they sent 3 replacement ear loops--without my asking for that. Another one broke today. Think this is it? Hardly. Try charging that thing, and once you're done, try disconnecting it from the charger cable: the base cover of the headset comes right off and stays attached to the charger cable. Each and every single time. Now, I consider myself very mechanically inclined and I rarely need to hire someone to fix things around the house. But for all intents and purposes, without holding the headset at the base with large pliers and only then pulling on the cable to disconnect it, there is NO way of keeping that plastic cover on the headset.

"I bought these to use on my Macbook Pro, so that I could use VOIP as well as listening to music when I'm working without having to worry about cables. While it certainly does fine in the VOIP front, where sound quality isn't really important, it is an utter failure as a set of headphones for listening to music.

"Qualifiers: I am a Mac OS user, live near a major highway, and work in a major urban (read: solid digital coverage). I am usually surrounded by computers, but am increasingly finding myself engaged in business travel, offsite meetings, and the like. For me, the Treo 650 rocks. Claims that it replaces a laptop are bunk. However, it can totally suffice when no other computer access is available. (Our company firewall went down and the only way I could connect to the internet was with my phone. THAT was a first.) Software can extend the Treo's capabilities, just as with any other computer, so having access to services like IMAP email accounts (the built-in VersaMail only does POP), Instant Messaging, and so forth really are what make the high price tag actually worth it (but yes, you do have to pay for the add-on software from third parties). I've had no problems with build quality, or with setup or service from Sprint. $15/mo. for unlimited wireless internet access? Worth it to me, based on my current internet usage patterns (so, of course, your mileage may vary). This is a digital-only phone, so service quality is directly tied to PCS digital coverage, so just be forewarned. The keyboard is great, but very small, so watch those carpal tunnels. ;-) The camera is low-rez, but it's great as a backup (only an idiot would try to use a 2004-era phone as their main digital camera - that's like serving water with a slotted spoon). Given that the Treo *is* a computer, it does crash. If you can't handle a brief reboot of your phone from time to time, don't even bother. It's not happened so often that it's been a major usability issue for me. The voice quality was skimped on, but there is apparently a firmware hack floating around to improve that (hopefully Palm will release an official patch). The Bluetooth syncing just works, for me, on both Mac OS and PC. On the Mac, downloading Apple's iSync conduit will allow full syncing with iCal and Address Book (sadly, minus categories and photos).

"I got the C650 as a replacement for the T610 - I liked the menus/display on the t610 better but was having major reception issues (signal strength jumped all over the place, missed/dropped calls) in major cities all along the west coast. I had this problem with three different t610 phones (how many I had to try before they'd let me switch brands) and know other people who've had this problem too. The c650 gets much more reliable reception. And to respond to other's comments: I find it's relatively easy to pop off the back if you put two nails of one hand in the two slots and one nail on the other hand where the silver inlay is on the top of the phone. I personally like that it's not easily removed - so your battery doesn't just pop off randomly (my old sprint phone would do this). Also, if you set one of the soft keys to ""recent"" you can easily access missed or received calls. You only have to hit the call button to see previously dialed calls. You don't need phonebook as a soft key since pushing the up/down button will get it for you. Finally, use the menu-* key lock!

"Update two years later: The unit's red light always stays on now, and it doesn't amplify the signal any more. I don't know if that's because I upgraded to a Motorola Droid 2, or what. But I always get 2 to 3 bars at my desk now, so I don't really need it any more anyway. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Overall, I'm pleased with the zBoost YX300 zPersonal Cell Phone Signal Booster unit, which I purchased to help with signal strength in my home office. It makes a definite difference. Not huge, but big enough to meet my needs, and well worth the price. I work out of my home office, and use my cell phone (currently a Palm Centro on Verizon) at my desk regularly. Standing out on my sidewalk, I get three bars. In most of my house, I get 2 bars. For whatever reason, sitting at my desk I would occasionally get two bars, but usually only one and sometimes none. After adding the zBoost, I always get two bars at my desk, which is a critical difference. I had hoped that I would get 4 bars at my desk, but that didn't materialize. But I'll settle for always having at least two bars, because now my calls don't drop and my voice quality is good. I found the setup pretty straightforward, with the exception of the suction cups on the antenna end not sticking very well, even to a slick surface. I solved that problem with an adhesive cable tie base, attaching the antenna to it with a couple of plastic cable ties. Fortunately, the suction cups on the base unit stick to the glass just great. It is crucial to observe the distances specified in the instructions, which are pretty scanty, on the back of the box. My base unit is stuck to the window at approximately the same height as the antenna (about five feet up), and the two are ten feet apart, give or take a couple of inches, and have a clear line of sight between them. I sit midway between the two, i.e., five feet from each. Both base and antenna are vertically oriented, if that makes any difference. The idiot light on the base is always green. It is also crucial to connect the antenna cable to the base first, and only then plug in the power. The light will be red, and stay that way for ten or fifteen minutes while the unit acquires signal towers, etc. Once it turns green, you can accurately guage the results. So, just three stars, because I had hoped for more bars, but the ones I got have made a critical difference to me.

"Installed and used it hours after delivery. My house is unfortunately not blessed with great water pressure. I have lived in a place where our water pressure was like a fire hose blasting at you and I must say, there is nothing I miss more than that type of water pressure. I bought the exact same shower head my old place had hoping I can get the same pressure but no luck. It wasn't even close. Then I ran into this shower head at our local fair and it looked impressive in their demos. I was very hopeful to get the same result when I get myself one. I got this here for $70 cheaper by the way than what they were selling it for at the fair. I am very satisfied. It didn't have the pressure like it was in the demo but It was still many times better than my old shower head. Even with the pressure being mediocre there was so much water coming out that it was still very effective and gives a shower I haven't had in years. I didn't install the flow saver (I need all the help I can get). A house with better pressure than mine should be even better and might get a massaging type performance out of it. I don't get that at my house but I do get much more water flow than before which is so nice and relaxing. If I was to change 2 things about this product, I wish they had an option with chrome or brushed metal look. It doesn't match the rest of my bathroom but the performance is worth sacrificing the look. Also I wish it was little bit easier to change the head location. It has many options in how you can position it but it is a bit stiff to reconfigure. I can see some females (my wife) having a bit of a hard time changing its positioning which will result in being lazy to use it at it's best. My wife loves washing her long hair with this specially because it can be positioned low, close and even behind her head.

"I've used my fair share of bluetooth headsets. Infact before i ordered the H721, I'd already ordered another one, which was returned unopened immediately after i had read the reviews on this one. This headset binds with 2 phones simultaneously. will handle calls from either phone very smoothly and redials the last number dialed using whichever cell was used last. I have realized that the phone that you pair 'second' with this headset is the primary unit. In case you walk away from you cell and it loses the bt connection, getting it to pair again would be more tedious if you paired your primary cell first. However, if you pair it second, all you need to do is to press the call button and bingo! instant reconnection, without going into painful phone menus. My iPhone works amazingly with it. This bt is a sure keeper. great voice quality and most of all nothing painfully sticking inside my ear. you won't even know its there. the voice is so loud, i have to keep it as low as 20-25%. i would recommend this unit to without hesitation.",positive,positive,0.3322327129953523,0.15026839823194615,0.5174988887727016
"I use a lot of AA batteries for photography and camping. I got tired of slow cheap chargers and bought the Maha Powerex MH-C801D 2 years ago. I couldn't be happier. As many other write about it, it's doing its job, and fast. I personally always use soft charging to go easy on my batteries and it never takes more than a couple of hours to charge AA or AAA cells. I use sanyo enloops, duracel, energizer and all work fine. How great this unit is became more evident when I bought and started using the Ansmann 5207123 Energy 16 Charger a few weeks ago. I needed a D cell charger and read some scary reviews about the MAHA D-cell charger, so went with the ansmann. First of all, the Ansmann is HUGE. it does have a capacity of 12 AA/AAA or 6 D, and no exterior power supply, but it's big. not a unit for travel really. But my biggest issue is how slow it is. D-cells took over 24 hours to charge (probably closer to 30 hours). Tiny AAA cells that would take an hour in the Maha are charging for 8 hours now in the Ansmann and only 2 of the 4 are ready. My observation - if you are only looking for a AA/AAA charger, and have modern NiMH batteries that can handle serious charging current - go with the Maha.",neutral,positive,0.13127455886118516,0.283990382332264,0.584735058806551

"Around Christmas 2004 I bought the Motorolla V276 phone from verizon. Horrible idea. Really horrible idea. I bought it because of the ideal price, but I really got what I paid for. The battery of the phone dies 3-4 times quicker than every other phone I have ever owned, there is a constant static in the background no matter if in the basement of my apartment or driving to work in the suburbs. It has gotten to the point where I can only talk on the phone when it is plugged into the charger and I am holding the phone at a certain angle. Usually when this happens I take it to the verizion store and they replace it with a new phone. So the customer service on this phone is great, and thats the only thing that saves it from a 1-star rating, but I shouldnt have to go to Verizion every 3 months to get a new phone. Maybe next time this happens I will just buy a Nokia. One last reason I dislike this phone (although not a technical problem): When going through your recent calls, it lists your last 60 phone calls.

"Positives: the noise cancelation works well and is a nice feature, Blue Tooth recognition is quick, easy and reliable over long separations between base and headset. And unlike another Amazon reviewer I have as good a result with the Motorola Razr and voice recognition as I have with any other headset. The appearance of the Jawbone is kind of spiffy, which you would expect from any product designed by Yves Behar and the people at Fuseproject Design in San Francisco. Negatives: there are little parts that tend to come off and the ear piece tends to get tangled up with things in your pocket and get bent. For instance there is a rubber cover for the charger connector terminals. I lost this in the second day of use and haven't seen it since. The rubber ear pieces tend not to stay put, but they give you spares of these. I may take to glueing these in place. There is no obvious place to put this thing when it is not on your head. A shirt pocket clip, of the sort that you find on a fountain pen, might help. Conclusions: I liked the out-of-production Jabra BT500 very much. This sat behind the ear, like a hearing aid. The ergonomics on the Jabra were just about perfect, but the Jabra BT500 is now out of production, and the follow on Jabra is said to be easily broken in normal use. The Jawbone is as good a head set as any on the present market. No vendor seems to have a really outstanding solution at the moment. This is kind of surprizing given the number of people who rely on these tools. Industrial designers awake!

"Day 1 summary: Not sure yet. Sounds fine and functions normally but button press response is sluggish and its rigidity is hard to get used to. I bought this headset to replace my years-old LG Tone HBS 730 headset which I abused in every kind of way: running in heat, running in cold, running in rain, building the shed, skiing, conference calls at work, losing it at the bottom of my backpack for weeks (where it was repeatedly crushed by my laptop and other random gear). My opinion of the LG Tone 730s is pretty good. Durable, dependable, comfortable, easy to use. Sound quality for phone calls, podcasts, and books is great. Sound quality for music is just ok, basically due to the utter absence of bass, which is a common complaint about Bluetooth sound from iPhone users. I also owned the LG Tone HBS 700 -- which was just as good until my vacuum cleaner got it -- and the HBS Tone Ultra 800, which offered ""JBL Signature Sound."" That one had the comfort and ease of use of its siblings, but the sound was barely better and the headset dramatically shorted out one warm day when I was out on a run. My guess is that the little switch that activated the JBL boost (located where it touched my neck) was not watertight, sweat got in and bzzzt: the end. Anyway. This is not supposed to be a review of the LGs. Just giving context. The Motorola Buds look cool. I got the white/black option. I want to be able to put it around my neck and forget about it until I need it, either to take a call or listen to something from my phone. I want long battery life, imperviousness to weather, comfort whether I'm running or doing whatever, 20 foot range, decent sound in my ears, and for callers on the other end to not know I'm on a headset. Pros in terms of fit: - I like that the ""arms"" are thin, with the intent being that they'll lay flatter against my collar bones - Having the bulk on the back of the neck is not bad - Having the indicator light hidden in the back and only active on startup/shutdown is great - Overall pretty comfortable Cons in terms of fit: - I don't like that it's harder to feel when the earbuds are properly seated on their magnets when I try to put them away while still wearing them - I don't like that the power switch is ""press and hold"" style rather than a mechanical switch - The Play/Pause and Track +/- switches are confusing - I didn't like the LG either. I'd prefer the simpler way Apple does it on their earbuds - just one rocker switch with 3 positions: Down (one click for volume, two clicks for track), Do Something (one click plays music or answers call, two clicks calls last person (I think), click and hold gets Siri), and Up (one click for volume, two clicks for track). This I'll get used to. Good idea to have the main button have little grooves on it so you know you're in the right place by touch - I am not sure I can get used to how rigid the whole unit is. While it is tapered to curve around the neck and down the front, I'm afraid it is going to get skewed around my neck and look dorky as it's cocked off to an odd angle, which I won't realize because the whole thing is so light that I can't feel what's going on with it. The LG's bigger ""arms"" are heavier, which serves to hold them down and theoretically keep them level. Overall initial fit and finish assessment is that it's pretty good, but I'm not sure the fairly rigid plastic design works for me (I'm 5'9"", 160lb.) I like the look of the flat cables that go to the earbuds, but like every other pair I've tried with flat cables, the added bulk and rigidity detracts more from functionality than it adds to style. Specifically, to make the wires flat, they are bigger than they need to be if they were just round, and that added width means they don't have the same range of motion of a smaller more flexible round cable. This becomes important when you turn your head and the earbud needs to follow your ear. The bud is light, the cable only wants to move the way it can, and I've noticed the bud getting dislodged. I read other reviews having this same experience, and think it's due to the flat cable. Sound - Pros - Similar experience to the LGs on my iPhone and Mac. Words sound good, music sounds just ok. I'm willing to trade away the bass for convenience of wireless/small/light/comfortable though - Using the Skype Test Call, it seems like phone calls will be fine - clear and loud enough for me, clear sound for the person on the other end. Sound - Cons - Bass is thin no matter what EQ setting I choose - One thing I'm worried about is that the mic picks up too much ambient noise (typing, paper shuffling, etc.) This might be a big problem cycling, walking outside, or driving. Or typing while on a conference call Overall sound seems to meet my expectations, which were not high. I am worried about the mic noise. Price: Way cheaper than any competitors (at this time, March 2016). So there's that. I've only had my Motorola Buds for a day. I have lots of experience with its competition, and overall the Buds are almost as good and significantly less expensive so I'd recommend them for anyone wanting a stylish, comfortable, convenient, easy to use Bluetooth headset but who doesn't have super high expectations about sound fidelity or total finesse in build quality.",neutral,neutral,0.0014794774313668217,0.9376865054801409,0.06083401708849225

"I've had this phone a few days now and I'm loving almost every aspect of it. I switched to this one after growing tired of some of the crappy ""features"" of my RAZR. This is kind of simple, but I love the fact that if I have a ringtone set for someone, it'd doesn't play every time that person sends me a text. Overall the phone is great, and all the other reviews talking about how great it is are right on, especially when compared to a RAZR. The things I don't like are: - You can't move the text on the screen, so it sometimes covers parts of your wallpaper. - It has mobile IM, but when you try to log in, you can't insert every kind of symbol. If you have an underscore in your email address you're SOL, no IM for you. - You can't change the soft keys to different functions so you always have Menu on the left and Camera on the right. - Call volume is a little weak in my opinion, but it works alright. - As with all Cingular's phones, there're ""Shop ______"" links at the top of every menu related to pictures, ringtones, videos, etc. It'd be nice if I could just get to my pics without being innundated with menu items that try to get me to buy things from Cingular. - For me, the top row of keys are a little hard to type when texting, but I got used to it, so it's not really that bad I guess. - Downloaded apps go to the Games folder, even when they're not games...

"I set this up in the mini-van in my driveway. Immediately upon attaching the phone, I became hopeful that this product would be great. My phone went from three bars to five. A great sign that this product does what it claims. Unfortunately, that's the most positive thing I can say about it. The negative feelings started with the installation. With a Honda Odyssey, the ideal configuration is to have the antenna go out through the one of the rear windows. Unfortunately, the cable is not long enough to do that unless you want it hanging across the center of your cabin. Should work fine on a coupe, sedan or pickup truck, or if you run the cable out one of the forward windows. The magnet on the base of the antenna is pretty strong, though I do wonder how it would have stood up to the nine feet of snow we got in this vicinity over the past few months. Because I was not happy with some of the other factors, I didn't bother to mount it to the dashboard. I would have been hesitant to do so in any case since it mounts with a large adhesive pad. I would prefer a suction mount or a dashboard beanbag. Unless you have the ability, I would recommend professional installation. All that said, if the performance were exceptional, it would be worth it for many who live on the edges of excellent cell coverage. As I mentioned, I was hopeful at first use, but alas, it didn't stand the test I set out for it. There is a five mile stretch near my home that has iffy coverage. When I was a Verizon customer, I never successfully transited that stretch without dropping a call. Upon joining Sprint recently, I have driven it twice without a drop. Today, the calls dropped quite readily while connected to the weBoost. I pulled my phone free while driving through that area, the bar level improved, and I was able to again connect a call. While doing this, I noted another troubling issue. The metal connector where the antenna attaches to the base was quite warm to the touch. I don't know if this is normal, but it wasn't something I'd expect. I will say that I plugged my Galaxy S5 into the device with the Otterbox cover on it. Removing the case might improve the performance, but such a requirement would make the product unusable for my purposes. It might be suitable for a traveling business person who spends a lot of time on the road in mediocre coverage areas, but it isn't worth the trouble for me. With high cost, an imperfect installation and iffy performance, I can't recommend this product.",neutral,neutral,0.10543578072295526,0.8113569618062713,0.08320725747077339

"I have had two problems with the V3 and a friend of mine had 1 problem. 1. It stopped working completely after I had it for 3 weeks. Then I waited a month to get a replacement. 2. I backed up my phone book on to my computer a few times. The last time I was trying to copy pictures from the phone to the computer I lost the connection (using USB cable). I tried with another computer, but it seems the USB port (or modem) of the phone no longer works. I'm not looking forward to taking it to the service and waiting another month. On top of it, the warranty continues from the original date of purchase, not from the time of the replacement phone. 3. My friend used her's with a Jaba bluetooth headset and the circuit board got fried. The phone had to be replaced. I've used mine with the same headset with no problem. In short, although I like the phone and it's features I am a fed up with the problems and would not encourage anyone to buy one. PS.

"Naturally for me the Treo 680 was my first smartphone choice from Cingular a long while back, and I expected great things from it. During the first stretch of the honeymoon period I LOVED this device, for it was basically a lateral move from my previous Palm TX pda. All the calendar entries and contact information had synched with no trouble at all to my Mac and other than the added phone application nothing much else felt any different. Then came the battery life that left much to be desired! Usually I am a stickler for recharging my devices EVERY night even when there is more than enough power for the next day. But nightly charging with the 680 had become a NECESSITY! Without overnight charging the Treo would barely make it past my morning coffee. It seemed like just navigating the menus with the stylus brought down the battery level right before my eyes! I took a chance on the qwerty keyboard in texting and word docs editing and did not like the feel of the buttons at all. They were cramped, too small and the feedback too rigid for any sort of comfortable typing with my fingernails. My current Nokia E61i qwerty feels like plush cotton compared to the Treo 680 and its buttons are perfectly spaced. The camera is good for what it is: a basic snapshooter. There is no way to expect any kind of great resolution or vivid colors from the VGA camera, but it gets the job done nonetheless. Call quality was truly excellent and is up to par with my Nokia. Actually I will admit that the Treo's call volume was better in comparison to my E61i. Reception, on the other hand, was a little bit shaky in my daily usage. There were a few times when the phone would reset itself in standby or in the middle of a call, but not as frequently as my first Sony Ericsson p990i. Wifi has become a standard that I have become accustomed to in smartphones and it is a shame that this Treo does not have it...but at the same time it isn't a dealbreaker either. Eventually I took the device back to Cingular due to the unwieldy bulkiness and horrible battery life. Despite this return, the Treo was an okay device that was an adequate introduction to the world of smartphones.

"Finally I switched to my cell phone carrier and joined the tempting big black Razor family, and I began to search for a Bluetooth headset even before I had the phone. It sounds silly but it is true - I wanted to have a match. My final selection ended with the black and Motorola branded Bluetooth headset, and of course, the highest model available, 850. So I'd like you to think of my experience before you add more to your credit card bill, and ask yourself, ""Do I really HAVE to have this Motorola 850 headset?"" However, it was like an online date, I wanted to like it, but it's just not for me. I have smaller and softer ears, and I have long hair and the worst, I wear eye glasses. These factors make it so hard for me to keep that thing stable on my ear. I always feel like it's going to fall off, and that is not a good feeling. I realized that a headset with ear plug would fit better for me. It took me a while to get used to it. I missed calls either by pressing it too many times, or I didn't realize that I could only get basic ringers because ring tones are not support via Bluetooth connection. It's not too bad to use it while I am driving except for the wired hanging feeling. If the phone's Bluetooth is on, connecting and calling is easy. But other cheaper pieces can do the same. The piece is very light and small. After having it for a week, I lost it because I refused to wear it all the time, and it's hard to store it anywhere - you have keys, ID, wallet, cell phone, PDA, iPod ... I'd advise you to get something cheaper. A discounted $69 for a Bluetooth headset is too much. When you look at that product, it feels cheap. Well, we always pay more for something new. My friend gave me the free headset that came with his cell phone, offered by Amazon.com, the Body Glove BlueVoice Bluetooth Headset ($29 without buying the phone). It's actually better than Motorola 850 for me although it got bad reviews. Heads up: I bought this piece from an Amazon.com vendor (via buy new or used link).

"Okay, so I have an LG Shine. And on that LG Shine I have about, oh lets say, 500 photos. So, I tried to be smart and read all of the reviews of the usb cable on this website. I waited about 3 days until it got here; very fast shipping in my book. It was easy to install. I can't tell you how many times I've bought things and them be hard to set up/install. I really like how you can transfer music and photos from your memory card. But that's part of the major flaw... It only transfers from your memory card. I received the memory card yesterday (which works just wonderfully!), so I was in good shape. But when I went to transfer the files about thirty minutes ago, I thought it was going to transfer *everything* to my computer. You can't even fathom how disappointed I was when I just saw the ten pictures from my memory card instead of the 500+ pics from my phone itself (before I got the memory card). So, my big advice? If you're looking for a usb cable to transfer files from your memory card AND phone, don't buy this. However, if you already have most of your pictures saved on your memory card (unlike me), go ahead and buy it. It does a great job of transferring. Overall, it's very nice. Easy installion, fast transfer, charges your phone as it's plugged into your computer. I just really wish it transferred my countless number of photos on my phone's memory.",neutral,neutral,0.04234905317759014,0.8138264289108966,0.1438245179115134

"I just bought the phone about 1 week ago, the phone has a good battery life and lots of cool features. The thing I like about this phone is that when you send a Text message from AIM you are not counted for a whole text message. while with other phones if you send just a simple ""hi"" that is already 1 text message used. The thing I am [upset] about is that you can't download new games, I have tried soo much and you still cant. The pixelation is somewhat OK its not all that great and the Camera doesn't show good quality pictures. Overall this is a good phone, it has lots of nice features, lots of ring tones and more you can download including wallpapers.

"About a month into ownership, the extending microphone quit working and was falling apart. Plantronics was easy to deal with when I inquired about an exchange. They must have felt the product was a little flimsy too, because they replaced the headset with the BackBeat model. While they (the Backbeat) are OK, they're not that great, and the micro usb charger is proprietary (a real pain). Plantronics has some good products out there, but the stereo headsets they make don't seem to be their forte; I'd go with another brand. **************************************** ORIGINAL REVIEW Another home run by Plantronics. I'm using it with an iPhone 3G and a Blackberry 8830. I'm sure there's better sounding stereo headphones out there, but as I'm not a purist or an audiophile, all I can say is they sound great to me. Very well thought out product and seems sturdy. The slide-out microphone feature is great. The convenience of using the 855 as a standard bluetooth headset and then just plugging in the other earpiece when you get to the gym is worth enough to me that I would have gladly paid the original $120-$150 asking price when it first launched; that I got it on Amazon for $55 is just gravy. The fifteen inch cord that plugs the second earpiece in is not just black vinyl - it's covered in a nylon woven fabric that is strong but flexible and isn't tangle-prone. I own several bluetooth headsets and one stereo bluetooth headset, a Jabra BT series over-the-ear/around-the-neck design. The Jabra sounds good too, but it just won't stay in place at all for me. Also, their design makes it hard to set them down; they act like a weeble and wobble all around. May not sound like a big deal, but inevitably, when you go to put them on the bench in the locker room while changing, they roll off to the floor. I've read a few reviews that complain about the fit of this headset and I find it hard to believe. It ships with three sizes of in-the-ear silicone tips and I find them very comfortable. My complaints are minor: A dedicated on-off switch would be nice (Motorola has this on a few headsets and it beats any multi-function button hands down), and the controls are on the small side for a guys hands. Overall, I'm very satisfied with this purchase and would recommend them to anyone.",neutral,positive,0.039483871508343454,0.27054046252410396,0.6899756659675527

"I bought this to use with my Zen Vision M Mp3 player as they are supposed to be compatible with each other. The Zen fits extremely snugly into the holder. So snug that I tore a little bit of the fabric trying to get it in the first time. So beware and be careful putting in your Zen and taking it out of this armband. It fits, but barely. (And contrary to another review i have a vertical earphone jack and it fits with this fine. The face of the Zen is obscured by the thick fabric that covers the armband. So once you have it in the armband and put it on your arm, you're pretty much stuck with whatever's playing. Forget adjusting the volume too. This limitation is quite inconvenient if you ever want to change what's playing or have to adjust the volume for external factors, but if you only want to set it on random or a specific playlist and go this limitation shouldn't matter too much. The fit is good. It stayed on my arm while working outside no problem. There is a velcro strip on the outside that might interfere with your clothes depending on what fabric you're wearing, but I haven't found it to be an issue for me. T shirts don't stick I guess.

"The initial headset we purchased had a glitch-it would go back into pairing mode once it was shut off and then turned back on. We even tried installing it on a different phone and had the same result. After consulting the manufacturer it was determined to be defective and it was returned for a replacement to the seller. The second one arrived and it has a different set of glitches, but it is workable. This one must be turned on and off at the menu within the phone as apposed to the headset which is inconvenient.

I was so afraid of her falling off her bike and having to hobble to the nearest phone. I was excited to get it, but that wore off fast.

It's a pay as you go, but you can't add minutes mid-month if you run out, your just SOL till you can add minutes the next month, no exceptions.

"As far as clarity goes it does a decent job. It has some cool features worth note. You can dial and answer with your voice. It loads all your contacts as well which is also cool. The bummer thing is that if you have two phones it has to do this with each new phone. Iphone has over four hundred contacts, work phone not as many. I ended up just not using it for work because I didn't want to go through and add four hundred contacts each time I switched, which was everyday. It is hard to get away from the tin can sound using bluetooth but BlueAnt does a credible job. The nagging thing is that the volume from the caller is not loud enough to cover engine and exterior noise levels. You will find yourself putting your ear up to your visor to make out what they are saying. Sometimes you will pick it up and talk into it which truly seems to defeat the purpose. Ultimately I don't use it anymore for these reasons. I will likely get one that will port it through my stereo speakers. If it had that one function I could likely rate it higher. As it stands it is a solid 3 stars. You could do worse, but something tells me there is better out there.

The screen protectors are very flimsy, they scratch very easily and leaves LOTS of bubbles on your screen. I tried the ever popular credit card application and it ended up scratching the first two I tried to put on (luckily it came with 3). Once you scratch the screen protector, it skews the colors appear underneath the scratch, so the longer you use it, the worse it gets.

"It was less than a month after receiving this item that the ""leather"" peeled away from the dividers in the device tray. Shortly thereafter the dividers themselves came loose from the backing. The ""leather"" then started to curl away from the corners where it is folded to wrap around the outside edges on the back, well on it's way to complete structural failure due to shoddy glue. I've attempted to repair it with various adhesives, but with no luck - the cheap, tacky, oily glue used to adhere the ""leather"" finish has permeated the pressed fiberboard that the item is made of and any solvent I would use to completely remove it so I could do a proper repair with new adhesive would cause the fiberboard to disintegrate.

"This adapter does its job, that is, allowing you to use a stereo headset to listen to music/videos/radio on a pre-2010 Sony Ericsson phone with a FastPort connector. Sony Ericsson's FastPort connector is intrinsically poor. Sony Ericsson should have dropped it sooner than they did. (From 2010 onwards it was replaced by a micro-USB for data/charging and a four-pin iPhone-style mini jack socket for the headset connection -- a combination that is fast becoming the industry standard.) The FastPort connector was a bad design. It is common to find one or more pins not making good contact due to dirt; and any movement of the plug can make the connection intermittent. Using this adapter you may experience these problems; but they are the fault of the FastPort design, not this specific adapter. Note that if you want to use an iPhone-style headset-plus-microphone that has a four-pin (""TRRS"") plug, this adapter will NOT work as the jack socket is only three-pin (""TRS""). There is no adapter that I can find that connects an iPhone-stype headset (with microphone) to a Sony Ericsson FastPort plug. (If you find one please let me know via a comment.) I have made my own by cannibalizing an old Sony Ericsson headset with a FastPort plug and a ""4-pin to dual 3-pin splitter"" intended for connecting an iPhone-style headset to a PC's audio-in and audio-out sockets -- and then connecting the FastPort plug to the 4-pin socket. In case you want to try this the connections are as follows. Note that there are two wires coming out of the 4-pin socket (mic and earphones), so mark them clearly before you chop of the two three-pin plugs!

"This is a review for boost mobile (nextel's prepaid service). I have a company phone when I travel during the school year, so I wanted a cool prepaid phone.

"I wouldn't rave about this particular bluetooth set. It works. It does the job, but I'm not over the top on this one. This would be a great bluetooth set for someone who jogs or bicycles.

A person I was speaking to could hear me clearly while I was sitting at a drive thru window waiting on food. In fact, the mic is so good, she could also hear the people inside the window talking.

I have not found a way to get it comfortably situated to where the wires aren't dangling all over the place and getting in my way. I haven't tried wearing it on the chain because that seems like it would be too far away from my mouth (mic is in the controller) and the chain is just going to be one more thing in the way.

"So I have had a V3i noir for a long time. It was quite the fashion statement when it first came out in mid 2000s. Unfortunately my phone finally gave up and died last month. Despite already having an iPhone, I realized I can not really live without my V3i, so I ordered another one from this seller. Bottom line, this is NOT the original phone released by Motorola. Everything about is off and feels cheaply made and they haven't even made any efforts to make it look legit. For example the user manual is quite clearly made by stapling a bunch of black and white photocopied sheets! And as another reviewer mentioned, the battery looks completely random, perhaps recycled with a sticker glued on it.

"I bought these buds at Costco for a bit less but worth the money here if you don't go to Costco. My husband has the more expensive Sony brand Bluetooth buds and loves them but when he listened to these buds he wasn't sure he heard that much of a difference to justify paying twice the price. The only outstanding feature that I liked on his Sony set was that it felt lighter and less cumbersome. The Motorola Buds are not heavy but they are a bit chunky feeling around the neck. Probably not an issue until you've worn the lighter options available. One thing to note here is that they aren't really wide and not very flexible. I'm not heavy but I am 60 and fuller around the neck than I used to be. I can feel the buds around my throat sometimes. My husbands Sony buds don't give me that sensation that something's on me. Overall, the Motorola has great sound and clarity with both calls and music. One thing I absolutely love are the magnetic ends that keep the earpieces in place when not in use. The magnets are strong and the buds seem to find their way to the end without me placing them securely. Pairing is easy so far with all of my Apple and Samsung devices. People are talking about the perspiration issue with these buds...yes there is the warning not to wear them in cases where sweat comes in contact with them. I have worn them around Las Vegas Nevada in 100 degree temps and of course I perspired. No problems at all with them getting sweat on them so far. The temps will be going higher soon and I will most likely be wearing a Frog cloth around my neck to keep cool. That won't stop me from wearing my buds because it won't be wet, just lightly moist. I will update the review just for and FYI sake for those interested. Like I said, the sound is great and the ease of use is equally great. Pairing fast and easy. Buttons well placed and easy to manage. Designed well but remember that they can be restricting for larger necks. I recommend these buds for anyone if you want the convenience of Bluetooth without spending a lot.",positive,positive,0.0007333176477399131,0.010090042095104728,0.9891766402571555

"I bought this booster for my camper when I stay in the woods at some distance from cell towers. In the particular area I am staying, you can just occasionally get a received call through but it usually gets dropped quickly. So I set up this booster with the boosted signal antenna inside the camper as recommended. But the only way to get a call through is to hold the phone inches away from the inside antenna. And even then if I move away just slightly, sometimes the call gets dropped. So I called the help line from Wilson and told them of my problem. And they told me that if there was a weak signal outside, then the signal would be weak inside. If that is true, I wonder about the claims that it will boost the signal by six times. And they told me the only way to fix that is to buy a bigger antenna or put this one higher. So I am not happy with this booster, but kept it because if I faithfully hug the inside antenna, at least I can get a call in and out.",neutral,negative,0.5737443237412507,0.3827510986724637,0.043504577586285585

"There are two ways you have your phone work with your car - get a device that you connect to your phone which outputs in a format that your car understands (FM transmitter, line-in), or have something built in, like a car stereo with Bluetooth. I am really a fan of the latter, because there is less clutter, it tends to work more seamlessly, and the cost really doesn't have to be much more - check out Sony's MEXBT3700U, for example. You can wirelessly stream A2DP audio, charge with the built in USB connection, and even use this port to stream music, giving the added benefit of displaying track info on the unit as well as the ability to navigate through songs without having to touch your device. And because it's one single unit, you don't have to worry about getting incoming calls while listening to the radio - it will still notify you. So why are we already a paragraph in and have I not started talking about the LiquidAUX yet? The way I think about this device is in the context of other devices that do a similar - or better - job. By function, it will never be perfect because it's not a fully integrated device - for example if your phone it set to automatically pair, you will only know you are getting a call if the stereo is set to AUX, so if you are listening to the radio, you will miss any incoming calls because the ringer be going through the line-in on the car. The car I have has a built in stereo that is part of the interior styling (volume, tuning, and climate control dials are all similar), so I decided to try the LiquidAUX to connect my iPhone before replacing the stereo, which would mean replacing a whole panel. I liked it because there were limited cables, and that it was one piece, so there wouldn't be too much clutter. Here are the two issues I had with it: 1. The big issue was that there was the static that many other reviews have already outlined. It made calls impossible, and the music was it and miss - there was the popping at quiet points and between songs. Kensington's website says a ground loop isolator should fix the issue, and that they would send one out for free. I called them and they said that it may not fix issues related to the Bluetooth version of the LiquidAUX, but they would send me one anyway if I wanted. I received it after about a week, and it worked - the sound quality is great for both music and voice, and as long as I speak loudly (just as with the MEXBT3700U's built in mic), I can be heard. However, now I have this huge drum like object that I try to tuck away in a compartment just so the device works as it should. 2. The forward/back buttons do not work with the iPhone - admittedly an issue with the iPhone, but meaning that I cannot justify attaching the remote to the wheel due to it's limited functionality. So, to sum up, the ground loop isolator makes this device passable in terms functionality. But the clutter also defeats one of the reasons I got it in the first place. It definitely is not as great as a more integrated solution, but for twenty five bucks and a wait for the device to make it work, it at least does it's job. Also, it's worth mentioning that if you are considering getting it because of less clutter, bear in mind that you will lose your car's power output and replace it with a USB power port. If that doesn't work for you, you'd have to get a socket splitter that would again defeat the object of having it out of the way.

"I lost my Samsung 410 headset a couple of weeks ago (it's small and when it goes in a pocket, it tends to redial the last number, a real annoyance), and I was faced with getting another. I got this one at Best Buy for $60 (lesson: shop Amazon) to try out. I reasoned that Samsung had probably made some engineering progress since I paid $80 for the 410. The 350 did have some noise reduction (less complaints about ambient noise when driving), but some was still there. What caused me to return the 350 was: 1: Miserable bluetooth reception. I had to have the phone on the same side of my body as the earphone, and many times it got scratchy until I pulled the phone out of my pocket and got it within 2 feet of my earpiece. Not all the time, but way too often. Unacceptable. (I use a Razr phone) 2: It fell out of my ear a lot. The 410 came with a variety of rubber earpieces so one would fit well and not come off, but the 350 comes with one size only. I know it comes with a wire earhook, but I don't like to use one.

"This is a great concept, and everything is good about it compared to a wired headset, except two things. First, there is a very little bit of static or fizzing sound in the background of listening to music with it from my Smartphone. And second, much less important to most except those like me, it doesn't capture the ultra-low frequency bass sounds that I like to hear. It has very good low bass and overall range from highs to lows. Understand the difference between low range bass and ultra-low range bass. I don't know if the slight hissing sound was due to the Smartphone or the speakers of the headset, but otherwise it's excellent.",neutral,neutral,0.010817383414834722,0.9344896755104604,0.05469294107470472
"I am using this with my Blackberry Storm phone. One would imagine that it would seamlessly integrate with a Blackberry phone. In fact, this is junk. The voice quality is dismal. If there is any other Bluetooth device nearby paired with your phone like, GPS, car bluetooth, etc., this one hangs. Once I had to take the phone battery out to shut this headset! It is tricky to turn it on and connect to phone. Pressing power button a sec more and you enter pairing mode. Equally tricky to disconnect it. The volume buttons are hard. The ear gel pads (comes in three sizes) are flacky and with no instructions to install metallic earhook. The only good thing about it is the mini USB charger which is cute, looks like a pen and fits in your pocket, clip included. If that's what you are after, go for it. Except, it won't work for any other device. Just to double check that problem is with the headset and not phone, I used 3 yrs old Motorola HS850 headset. Perfect! Also used 4yr old Jabra, no problems. It's a shame on Blackberry to market such a device. No wonder they are disposing it off.

"I have owned this phone for exactly one year, and here is my report. About six months ago horizontal white lines began to appear on the LCD screen and, over time, the problem began to get worse and worse. Exactly one week ago I turned off my phone and allowed it to charge overnight. In the morning I turned the phone back on and discovered that I could no longer see anything on the internal display - it had whited out. This is a very common problem with this Samsung model and it is enough reason to stay away from it. Testimonies from other reviewers on this site, and others, corroborate this, but if you still want to take a chance on this model then you should be aware of some other potential problems that this phone suffers from. When you view a complete log of all sent and received calls whenever you press the Send button, scanning through them is a real hassle. Pressing a key once often cycles through three entries, and it's annoying when you want to make a call to a phone number in your log but the phone keeps overshooting it. Very buggy, not to mention excruciatingly annoying. Also, a couple months ago all of the address book entries that were stored on my phone got deleted. I have no idea what could have caused this, but it apparently is another common problem with this model. The supplied ringtones that Samsung offers on this phone are nothing short of pathetic. It seems every ringtone that was programmed into this phone was meant for teeny boppers or little kids. There are no standard ringers on this phone and because of this I had my phone on vibrate all the time when I was out and about. However, if the ringtones are your cup of tea you cannot assign them to individual contacts. The only way you can do this is if you make your contact part of a group in your phonebook. Why Samsung would make it so that you can assign ringtones to groups, and not individual address book entries, is a mystery. When you close up the phone to end a call, the phone still stays on the line for well over a second. This means that if somebody were to say, ""wait, I forgot to tell you something"" it leaves them with the impression that you just hung up on them. This was a very disappointing offering by Samsung, and I'm quite surprised that they haven't issued a recall of this model due to its host of defects, and I'm equally surprised that T-Mobile continues to sell this phone with their service. You would be better suited with another model.",negative,negative,0.7274316514458146,0.26336370731685266,0.009204641237332875
"When I first got this mount I was pretty happy with it. Unfortunately it did not last. About 6 months after I got it there were problems, and within 9 months it was in the garbage. The problem is that the months these nice little arms on the sides that slid in and out on gears so that it can accommodate devices of various sizes. While this is good in theory, the gears are plastic, and wore out. At first it started getting stuck open or closed. After a while it stripped the gears and the arms became frozen in place. No amount of work was able to make it work again, and into the garbage it went. I would not buy this again.",negative,negative,0.978094714268201,0.01977316086075286,0.0021321248710460213
"I bought the Nuvi at a great price at Amazon ($134.00 & free shipping), so I didn't expect top of the line features or performance. I must say that I am very pleased with the unit. The only disappointment was the need to purchase and download the City Navigator program for Mexican cities. I had hoped that this would be included, since the product had been advertised as a ""Nuvi 200 Mexico"". After several tries with extremely long waits (25 min)--I finally got to talk to a real person on their support line. He explained that my unit has Mexican highways, but for city navigating, I would have to purchase the additional City Navigator program for $49.95 The preinstalled highway maps are not at all helpful, since they refer to highway numbers which are rarely indicated with signage. And of course, once you enter a city of any size, you need specific instructions to thread your way through the disorder-- and lack of signage-- to continue on the highway you want for your particular destination. This was completely lacking until I did the City Navigator download. Other small details: the unit does not distinguish one-way streets, and can route you heading the wrong way on a one-way street. When doing a search for a city with a long name, such as San Miguel de Allende (21 letters and spaces) you have to type in more than 15 letters before the unit kicks in, and provides the name. I cannot understand why the recognition does not come sooner on such a long name if it is a repeated city search. There are many hidden features which are helpful and fun that I am still becoming familiar with. Overall this is a great entry-level product, and I am enjoying it very much.",positive,neutral,0.14229185538869574,0.48445638336432284,0.3732517612469815

"I bought this item because of the advertised 7800 mAh and because it is slimmer than others of similar charge capacity; however, it doesn't hold the charge all day. I also have the Anker Samsung Galaxy S5 Battery Combo, Anker 7500mAh Extended Battery Combo which lasts me all day on a single charge with only 7500 mAh but is thicker. Bottom line, if you don't use your phone for business emails, calls, and constant use all day, it will last but it doesn't hold the charge as well as the Anker. I will try the Limefuel next.

"I got this as a single device replacement for my cell phone and Palm Vx. Its performance as a phone has been a tremendous improvement over my old Ericsson T19LX - call quality using AT&T service in New York is great, as is having my PDA address book integrated with the phone so I don't have to worry about updating phone numbers in multiple places. The size is quite respectable considering how much functionality it contains, but definitely somewhat large for a current model phone. As a PDA, it is functional but suffers from some flaws. Importing contacts from Palm Desktop did not work - many entries where I had a home and mobile number showed up with one entry called homemobile and dropped the other number. When I moved everything to Outlook and synchronized it worked fine. However, it still does not sync note fields for to-do and calendar entries, and Nokia says they have no plans to fix that. The phone's to-do editor does not let you make an entry without a due date, and also does not let you turn off the alarm that occurs on the due date. Accessing POP3 email works, but if you want to delete a message from the phone while leaving it on your server you still have to leave the header on the phone and scroll past it in your inbox. I solved some other problems by installing ActiveDesk and ActiveMail from Cibenix, which I would definitely recommend if you purchase this phone. Overall, I would give this 5 stars for packing some great hardware into an attractive package with great phone functionality at a good price. However, the PDA software flaws knock it down a notch.",positive,positive,0.016315083109834087,0.4637135056465463,0.5199714112436197

"Only been using it for a day or two. First thoughts is it is smaller physically than the Zero Lemon version but rated higher mah. Nice that it doesn't block the speaker. Nice case. I don't understand the reasons for the critical reviews, I have used extended batteries for years mostly the zero lemon, this battery is definitely an upgrade to the oem. My s5 wouldn't get through a whole day of phone calls, Pandora, email, Facebook, and maybe a little Hulu streaming. With ANY extended battery I have owned I can do all these things and still have 30% or more battery life at the end of the day. Sometimes even go for 2 days! Now if I don't do all those things and I'm in a good service area then the battery will last 3 days. If you really don't notice any improvement over your OEM battery then either you got a lemon or something else is going on. Wouldn't be surprised if the Zero lemon guys are leaving bad reviews because Powerbear's 2 year warranty is far beyond their 180 days. Honestly Zero lemon feels like a cheap knockoff compared to my experience with the powerbear so far. Update: after using this for a month I can say it is not as long lasting as advertised.

"ONLY DOES 1/2 OF WHAT I BOUGHT IT FOR!! These BLUETOOTH headphones can technically be used as BOTH a headset for a mobile phone AND headphones for MP3 at the same time.

So i figured I would be able to talk and also listen to MP3 with these using my V3t phone. But NO DICE. According to moto, ONLY the moto Q has the ability to play the MP3 over the bluetooth.

"First how it compares to my previous phone, a Motorola Razr: this LG phone is metal and thus sturdier. The LG port where you attach a charger has a cover over it so it doesn't get damaged by water, dirt, etc. I had problems with the uncovered port on the Razr. On the Razr it was very easy to accidentally hit the side buttons and thus change settings without even knowing it. The LG also has side buttons but they aren't as easy to accidentally depress. So far this thing holds a charge much longer than my Razr did but the Razr battery declined continually, despite my doing the recommended full run down and full recharge periodically. I hope this phone's battery continues to outperform the Razr. The numbers on the screen are big and that is very helpful as our baby boomer generation ages and starts needing eye glasses. My one concern is the heat generated by the battery. The battery can get pretty hot if I talk for 30 minutes or more. I'm concerned about what effect this might have on the battery's life. Overall I'm happy, this phones seems much better made than the Razr it replaced.",neutral,positive,0.06024449912828011,0.0892522174751733,0.8505032833965466

"I bought this unit about a year ago, mostly because my sister had one and thought it was really good. Also liked the fact that it can't be turned on accidentally. When it arrived I tested it, and even though I could hear on it the person on the other end could not hear me. I tried turning it off and on, tried muting and un-muting it - nothing fixed it. Perplexed, I called Motorola customer service.

Once again I had to pay for the shipping myself, but at least the 3rd time was a charm. This one worked! Now, about a year later, suddenly the mic has gone out on this one. I handle the thing very carefully, it's never dropped or abused in any way. I have to say DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT!!!

"This is just a very cheap version of a field strength meter for detecting Electromagnetic fields. That is what EMF stands for. I have had one of these for over 20 years and this meter is at the bottom end of the scale. I laugh when I see these ghostbusters using these meters to impress people. It is nothing more than a toy which is now overpriced and does not read nuke radiation. When I first bought this exact meter, it was only $29. So that should give you an idea on the gouging involved. Here is how that works (in basic lay terms): All electrical devices produce electromagnetic fields when they are powered on and pulling electrical current. The meter registers how strong the EM field is for such devices. The more current the device uses... the higher it will register on the meter. Things like microwave ovens, toasters, high voltage power lines, TV tube type sets... anything that pulls a lot of power will register high. This meter does NOT read radiation (which comes in many forms). It will not read alpha, beta or gamma ionizing radiation such as from nuclear sources. It will not read RF (radio frequency... such as microwaves). What it is reading from your microwave oven is the Electromagnetic field produced by the electrical current and power transformer in your microwave. It reads the strength of electrical fields. Nothing else. The reason the meter will register at walls and various areas of the house, is because it is reading the Electrical wiring in the walls which has AC current flowing through them. These are not ghosts in the walls despite what these [...]might have you believe. It is reading the fields from electrical power being pulled through that location. It is easy to test, just shut off the main AC breaker to your house. Shut all of your power off and then you can see how those so called ""Hot spots"" will disappear. The meter only registers electrical fields... despite what these goofy people might have you believe. Some sections of electrical wiring in your walls will register higher because anytime the wiring is compressed, it will cause heating at that point. This is often caused by the AC wiring being compressed by the Staples used to fasten the AC wiring to the wood framing inside the walls. This heating from compression often causes destruction of the insulation on the wiring... but it is not a ghost. You may also be reading a point where more than one electrical wire converge. This is not a statement as to the existence of ghosts... but this is a statement about this meter and what it can and cannot read. It may be exciting to see the meter fluctuate at a wall, but it is nothing more than electrical current you are reading in the wiring at that particular point in the wall. As I said, shut off all the power to the house with the main breaker and you will see how it will go away. However, keep in mind, if you are dealing with a crook who is trying to make you believe they have a magic way of detecting spirits with a cheap field strength meter... they are also capable of using tricks to fool you by using little devices hidden in your home or in their pocket... to set off the meter. You should also know that those polaroid films can be multiple exposed with various images. They can be exposed more than once. My father used to do multiple image exposures on those as a hobby. He could expose more than 4 separate images on a polaroid film. A unique feature of polaroid film. You can also expose images on ""sealed"" film still in a package. So if someone uses a polaroid and shows you some ""image"" on the photo which wasn't there in the room, it is quite likely the image was preexposed by the person associated with the film and camera. Either way, just know that this meter only detects electrical fields. The more current the appliance pulls and the larger the power transformer, the higher it will register. This particular meter is the cheapest, bottom of the barrel meter you can buy... but a great toy for lay people who have no familiarity with electrical fields.",negative,neutral,0.09235755214500256,0.6734061651681053,0.23423628268689226
"No matter how hard I try, I cannot apply this product without getting bubbles under the film. The bubbles are easily visible on several of the darker screens on my phone, and I cannot push them out with the piece of cardboard that was supplied. This is not a problem that is inherent in products of this type. I previously applied a screen protector to my Zune. That protector film came with an after-market case; unfortunately I do not know the identity of the manufacturer. It went on easily, leaving one or bubbles that were quickly pushed out of the film using the supplied plastic applicator. Two years later, you still can't even tell that it is there, even when the device screen is black. I will be returning this item and demanding a full refund.

"I ALSO bought the Motorola 820 and 850 models along with this Jabra so I could try all three. Although the Motorola's are nice, I always felt they were going to fall off, so I returned them and kept the Jabra. Sound quality on all three were very good, but the 850 had an echo to it. I really like the way the Jabra sits over the ear, but most of the weight is behind/below the ear. It feels more comfortable, and does not feel like it will fall off. Although I do sometimes get static, overall the quality is wonderful, and so far the battery life is great. I have used this wireless headset for numerous long phone calls and have yet to have it die on me. You will not be disappointed with this purchase. By the way, one other selling feature compared to the Motorola's: I seem to be able to keep the volume down pretty low on the Jabra, but have the option to turn it up much higher in louder environments. With the Motorola's, I always had the volume near the highest setting, even in low or normal sound environments.

"I've purchased two of these phones but I didn't get a chance to use the phone I purchased from Amazon. My phone arrived fairly quickly but when I opened the box it was immediately obvious that the phone manufacturer's box that's inside the Amazon.com box had been opened. When I opened the manufacurer's box all of the packing material was missing and the box contained only loose phone parts (phone body, back cover, battery, AC adapter) that had apparently been bouncing around alot. The phone was badly damaged, the front of the phone was a spider web of cracks and it appeared that the camera lens may have been cracked as well. I sent it back the next day and Amazon gave me a prompt credit for my return in about a week. After receiving my credit from Amazon I went to ebay and bought this phone for about $30 more and it arrived brand new and in perfect condition. It also came with many accessories, including software CD, data cable, stereo headset, holster, car charger and 1GB memory chip. I installed my SIM card and the memory chip and the phone works like a champ. I loaded the phone tools software on my HP laptop and it immediately updated to the latest version. I just use the synchronization for my Outlook contacts and calender and it has worked well with only one minor issue. For some reason the software was synchronizing with the calendar information in my archive folder. Once I changed the synchronization setting to go to my current calendar folder there have been no issues. So far I've only downloaded a few ringtones from the internet and they have downloaded quickly and flawlessly. This is my first Motorola phone (I'm a former Nokia owner) and I have found this phone easy to use. The sound quality is very clear, definitely better than any of the Nokia phones I've had, and the signal strength and reception seem to be better as well. I've had no problems with accidental pushing of the buttons on the exterior of the phone. The phone construction is very solid, nothing cheesy here. I have the black model and the finish is excellent and after a week of use remains without a scratch. I'm very happy with this phone and would recommend it to others although I would purchase it elswhere since Amazon's supplier seems to to be getting a reputation for poor packaging and damage during shipment.",positive,positive,0.04415943749237269,0.05839864657442783,0.8974419159331996

"I bought this phone to replace a Treo 600. The 600 was a terrible phone. It had a buzz when used as a phone. This is a very good phone and great pda. There are hundreds of programs for it. I researched the 680 and the BlackJack. I have the Cingular 8125 as my work phone. I'm very pleased I went with the Treo. It is so much easier to use and can be used with one hand. The windows phone I use at work requires the stylist to do most anything. You can easily use the keyboard on the 680 with one hand for text messages. There are a lot of programs for the Treo. When I first got the phone it went into a constant loop after I tried to sync with my old Treo 600 software. Cingular wasn't much help. I got on Palm's website and went to the knowledge base found the problem and followed the easy instructions and I was back up and running. The speakerphone is also good. I talked for 2 hours on it and the party I was talking told me it was very clear when I told her I was using the speakerphone and ask her how it sounded. The only big negative I've found with the phone is the battery. I guess that is true with all the smart phones these days. The second negative would have to be the camera. It is improved over the 600, but still not near as good as most of the other camera phones. No more than I talk on the phone I can recharge it at night and I'm fine, but if someone talks all day long they should plan on having a second battery and charger. Unless you need to watch streaming TV over the wireless network, need a better camera, or long battery life I think you will love the Treo 680. For Palm phone users you will like not having the antenna, but without getting it out of the old Treo cases is much harder. This is a great pda, a very good phone, a fair camera, mp3 player and a pretty good video player. I bought some DVD software at palmgear and I slapped a DVD in my laptop and set the size I wanted it cut to for my SD card and created a movie. I loaded it on my SD card and it plays great on the 680. This is a great device and for the money and would be very hard to beat. Where else can you get an mp3 player, video player, pda, phone and have hundreds of programs that are inexpensive to expand it's value? You can add a car navigation to that list if you buy the available bundle. This is old Palm technology and very solid. For me it amazing to get so much for the price. The problems with the Treo 600 are fixed in this device. I much prefer it to my Windows based Cingular 8125.

"The 1st time I used Our Signal Booster it worked great. Cell phone went from 2 bars to 4 bars for both voice and 3G data (Verizon). Laptop Verizon AirCard went from about 500 Kbps to 1000 kbps download speeds. Very nice! However, the second time I used it, I tried pointing the high power antenna out a window on the opposite side of the house to see if there was a closer cell site. I followed the directions, including making sure the low power antenna was greater than 20 feet away and pointed towards the high power antenna before turning on. This time, it initially showed a green light, then a red light and the light faded. I moved the low power antenna further away from the high power antenna and tried again. This time the light didn't come on anymore. I tried moving things to the way everything worked the very 1st time, but no light would come on. It was using power, because the low power unit was getting warm. The coax connection point was also getting really warm. But, it was no longer boosting the signal (no change in cell phone bars). It seems to have gone dead! We contacted the company (who seems very nice)and they said they will do a warranty replacement of the amplifier. We will update with details!

"Pro - Decent sound quality Con - HORRIBLE battery life. The battery life voice says ""More than 5 days of talk time"" and counts down to ""More than 4 days..."" then ""More than 3 days..."" then it's dead. I think the designers made a huge mistake -- they meant to program it to say ""Less than 5 days of standby time..."" then a day later ""Less than 1 day of standby time left."" The standby time is that bad. Be prepared to charge it every other day or so which is an enormous pain in the neck. More often than not, the unit is dead on my visor. My previous Motorola hands-free speaker (TX500) would last a LONG time on a charge. Worse, the Roadster Pro won't even take a full charge overnight when charging on the cigarette lighter power port. To get a full charge, I have to take it into the house and use a more powerful charger with micro-USB cable. After owning this unit for several months, the Bluetooth connection is becoming unreliable. Sound is initially choppy and garbled after first connecting phone to Moto unit, but it improves after several minutes. Placing the phone very close to the Moto unit helps a bit (inches) rather than feet. I really wanted to like this item based on my experience with my Moto TX500 which claimed ""the longest standby time with up to 6 months, and the most talk time with up to 45 hours"" -- and lived up to those claims. I was hoping for improved sound quality and equivalent battery life, but I am extremely disappointed.

Let's start with why it is impractical. It hangs around your neck, with the control pod down on your chest. Needless to say, you look like a goon if you wear it outside of your shirt and it is very comfortable inside of your shirt. If you wear a jacket or sweatshirt it shouldn't be a problem. Extra impractical if you're running. The actual headphones are not replaceable (though they are on other, cheaper Sony headsets). The wires are also not braided. Guess what's going to happen? Yes, your wires will fray naturally or be chewed on by a pet within a month and your $100 headset goes in the trash. Compare to the Voyager 855, which has a braided cord on its optional (and replaceable) headphone, and only costs around 30 bucks. Which brings me to the price. Did I mention it was $100 for a product unlikely to last more than a few months unless treated with zealous care? If I'm going to need to replace my headphones every month, I'll stick with my cheapos, thank you very much. The UI is maddening. It can connect to multiple devices, but to do so you must hold the menu button, navigate to the devices menu, the select a device. You do all this on a control pod whose buttons seem to have been designed to give you hand cramps. The control pod itself is larger than most headsets, and even larger than some media players. My second MAJOR problem is connectivity. I tried connecting it to two products: an iPod Touch 2g and a Sony Ericsson Walkman W580i phone. The iPod touch supports the fancy Bluetooth profiles that let you listen in stereo and control your music playback, while the phone doesn't. The initial pairing on either product took an extremely long time and multiple attempts. Nine out of ten times it would time out and give up trying to pair. I followed all instructions meticulously and placed the devices at varying distances from the control pod. If getting it to pair was a matter of trial and error, getting it to connect was like winning the lottery. There was no rhyme or reason to how it decided to connect to my devices. I would press connect on my phone or iPod and wait. It would try to connect, then give up and say 'Not Connected'. I would then repeat this about ten times. Eventually, if I was lucky, I'd get a connection. That connection would work for about one minute before it spontaneously disconnected. I can't tell you anything about this product's sound quality or battery life because I couldn't keep it connected long enough to make a call or start a song. The worst part of this is that I was using a Sony Ericsson phone! Even worse, I was at least able to get the iPod to connect for about a minute, if only once or twice. The phone never actually connected after it was paired. The same phone connects flawlessly and automatically with both a Garmin Nuvi GPS device and the Plantronics Voyager 855, as does the iPod. I do not recommend this product to anyone. Even if you have no problems connecting the headset, it is still an impractical and expensive headset that will be a pain to use for the month you own it before a wire frays and you have to throw it away. Buy the Plantronics Voyager 855 instead.",negative,negative,0.9747517607430888,0.020798236030990146,0.004450003225921236

"Cons: Sluggish. Hangs every now and then. Video (movies) does not play for more than 10-15 min after that the sound comes but the screen freeze. Even after Xenon flash indoor shoots are hazy.

Camera for all cell phone standard is extremely good, I used it on a trip and I am happy with the results.

"I was hoping this would be a good phone. I had a MotoROKR and loved it. This phone was based off a similar design so I though it'd be a good fit. THE BAD * The phone came in a different language. I think French. It took me about 4 minutes to get it from French to English. During that time I noticed the phone was slow. Normally about a 1.5 second delay from the time I pressed the the middle select button til the time the screen changed. Not a good sign * Once I finally got the phone on English, I realized I had no service. Imagine that. I got service with my old phone. I get 3G service with my iPad. This phone's antennae could not get even 1 bar. * The camera: I know phones don't have amazing cameras. My ROKR was pretty decent. This poor phone's was mediocre. No pictures looked good unless it was taken in direct sunlight And that was the extent of my use. I can't have a phone that doesn't work. THE GOOD Well, even though I used the phone for 10 minutes I did like some features of the phone. * The LCD screen was nice, vibrant, and was not easily washed out by the sunlight. I went outside to see if I could get a signal; even in sunlight, the screen was still visible. Motorola did a good job with this screen * The buttons on the phone were big and easy to press. The phone is a big phone. Not quite as wide as the iPhone but about about 3/4"" shy of that. * I like the menu layout. Very intuitive. The pictures match exactly what you think they do. Hence, it was easy to navigate in French I'm not sure if this phone is a good phone or not. Were my ROKR got very little signal, this phone got none. Where my ROKR was fast, this phone lagged. I've seen other reviews saying this phone is slow to navigate, I can confirm this. While 1.5 seconds isn't dire, its not that good either. My ROKR had 2GB of music on it, I used it as my camera, and the photos came out very well for a mobile phone. This phone could do neither. The camera had trouble focusing on anything unless it was in bright sunlight. Overall, I'd say go with a different phone.",negative,negative,0.6894188424414602,0.2608805137313878,0.04970064382715194
"Palm should have retained more of the features of its plain PDA OS, rather than trying to copy stupid interface features from Microsoft. Overall, NOT a great job, really. The reviews are quite unhelpful about the PDA applications. And battery standby life is about half of the 300 hrs specified in the description. I used to like the Palm OS, but... The OS now used by Palm in the Centro (and 680)is a screwed up version of what they have in their PDA's. For example, in Contacts, there is no longer a compact, single line, listing form. Instead, you must view all phone numbers for each entry on separate lines in the main listing. No choice. This means you can't see very many listings per page. Also, if you are not careful about entries, and put a word description with a phone number, you may just get a blank line. It used to be that word descriptors were just fine, as well as helpful. Blackberry has the more flexible and compact entry format that Palm used to have. Also the amount of information you can now enter for each number is more limited. Two steps backwards for Palm. Also, if you press a letter, such as ""J"" to see all the last name listings that start with ""J"", in alphabetical order, you are out of luck. It finds every bloody listing entry with a ""J"", whether it is first name or last, that you have to scroll through. This means fewer helpful listings per page. It means you can no longer enter a letter to skip that far down into the alphabetical listing, and if you enter something as specific as ""john"" to get to Johnson, you will go instead to first names listed as ""john"", assuming there are any in your contacts before Johnson. Also don't try to be cute and enter several letters such as ""jaa"" to go to the start of the ""j"" listings. The PDA will complain and not even let you scroll further down. The plain PDA OS does it sensibly and returns an alphabetical listing of last names starting with ""J"" if you entered a ""J"". And you could scroll from there all the way to Z if you so desired. One bug in the Treo 680 that has been fixed in the Centro relates to the display of contact information. Suppose you click on a contact entry for which you entered a fair amount of information. That is, more than can be displayed on one screen (Given the inefficient way information is now displayed, that is not hard). On the 680 you will not find any cursor or arrows to let you move up or down the page to see additional information. But there actually is one that is invisible in the bottom right of the screen. On the Centro, it is visible. But did Palm fix this bug in the 680? No. Owners of that model are stuck. This is expected given the general contempt Palm shows toward its customers. You will also find stupid changes in the Calendar. For example, you could on a Palm PDA hit an entry for 9am on a particular day and it would let you start an appointment with 9 am as the default entry for start time. That is, while you were viewing other appointments you could select an open time for a new appointment. Now it doesn't enter that default (on the next screen). In my view, Palm has messed things up enough you might as well use some other OS. Like what Blackberry offers, although overall their PDA/PIM seems less efficient. Oh, and customer support says this new PDA platform is exactly what Palm intended for the PDA smartphone, even though they know it is different from their PDA's. So which do they think is better? If they think so highly of the implementation on the Smartphone, why don't they change their PDA's? Palm won't say, but I think we can guess. Palm's right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing, and anyone with good judgement has long since left the Palm development group.",neutral,neutral,0.1634876234539565,0.7623679025353299,0.0741444740107134

"Ordered this 'charging kit' for my Tungsten E2 through BargainCell, as I have purchased from them in the past, and up until this, didn't have a problem with them. Found that this 'charging kit' WILL NOT charge a Tungsten E2! Back and forth e-mails to BargainCell, two long distance telephone calls, about an hour on the telephone, with them telling me that this 'charging kit' is compatible with both Tungsten and Treo models. Well is 'not'... The cable will initiate a 'sync' when the button is pressed, but it will not charge the E2. Tested it myself, compared it to an original Palm cable and noticed that the cable from BargainCell has about half the number of pins in the connector base to connect to the Palm. No doubt missing the ones that provide the 'charging'! Kind-of makes the USB car adapter and the wall adapter like totally 'useless', unless someone wants to try and sync their palm to their car, or home! Looking around the Internet I see many similar products, all claiming to be compatible with both the Tungsten and the Treo. After this experience, with BargainCell still claiming that these cables are compatible with both models, now I have to question 'all' other such listings, making the same claim! Paying nearly as much for shipping as the item itself, BargainCell expected me to send this back for a refund! No doubt not refunding 'my' shipping expenses back to them, and deducting the shipping expenses I already paid to have this sent to me! Needless to say, a loosing proposition either way to me. Either go through all that trouble and expense for what would be a 'couple dollar' refund, or keep the USB auto and wall charger and toss the cable in the garbage. With numerous other listing all making the same claim as to 'compatibility', I think I'll save my time and aggravation and just spend the $20.00 and get an original from Palm!

I'll spend the extra and get original OEM products, and probably in the long run, actually save money, not having to deal with time lost on e-mails and telephone calls, after incompatibly issues are discovered, and companies not bothering to do proper research!

It seems the number of conductors differs between the male end of the adapter and the female end. On my unit, the right headphone is intermittent, and the control button and microphone on my headset (Skullcandy) do not work. Also, as indicated in the user photos in the item listing, the unit I received does not have the same kind of strain relief as the seller's picture (in which the strain relief is separate white tubing); rather, mine has a molded integrated strain relief found in the fourth user picture above. I checked the adapter with an electrical continuity tester, with a male-male TRRS cable plugged into the female end of the adapter. From the adapter's male end, the tip, R1 & R2 are connected through, but the sleeve isn't connected to anything. I don't know if I just have a faulty unit, or if this is the same for all of them. My guess is that the male end of the adapter is TRRS, but the female end is TRS (like a regular stereo plug).

"The technology on this product is fine; the speaker is good, the microphone picks up sound well, it pairs easily enough, etc. It's even super-small without sacrificing anything. However, the design and user interface of the WEP500 make it near unusable. Specifically, it's the multi-function button that kills it. The multi-function button covers nearly half the surface of the device and is really easy to press. All well and good, except that by default pressing the multi-function once redials the last number. What this leads to is a flood of ""pocket dialing"" if you happen to put this in your pocket, or even just when you're trying to put the thing in your ear. I've taken to dialing my voicemail constantly just so that if my WEP500 accidentally dials a number it won't be anybody I know. That's an insane hoop to have to jump through just because of a bluetooth headset. If you're going to leave this headset in your car or on your desk, and be extra careful every time you insert the earpiece, the device is fine. If you expect to ever transport this with you anywhere, or are less than careful handling it, then this is a headache.

"I just got this phone a few days ago. It is absolutely amazing. I wasn't planning on getting this phone until I actually saw one in person. I wasn't too impressed with the pictures of this phone on the internet but when I saw one in person, I couldn't close my mouth. I just had to get it. The LCD screen is very big and bright (you can change the brightness level of course). You'll be amazed by the rotating camera/camcoder feature of this phone. You can zoom in/out in camera mode and it has the best video recording mode out of any cell phone out there. You can download mp3s and set them as your ringtones or play full mp3s. You can even download video clips and watch TV shows. The phone came with a music video and the video quality was exceptional. The phone has 70MB built in memory but it comes with a 32MB transflash card which is one half the size of your fingernail. You can buy a bigger transflash card if you need more storage space. The fact that this phone is quad band means it will work almost anywhere in the world, which is a big plus. The phone is roughly the same size as Motorolla Razr but it is lighter and has superior features not to mention it's a SLIDER PHONE! However, no phone is perfect. -I wish the phone had a small hole for cell phone straps or keychain. -Camera does not have a flash. -You cannot set MP3's that aren't DRM (Digital Rights Movement) protected as ringtones. You will need to change the MP3 file extention to .3GP to be able to set them as ringtones, which is a little annoying. You can still play all the MP3's on the phone, but only the ones with DRM protection can be set as ringtones (unless you change the file extention to .3GP).

In the particular area I am staying, you can just occasionally get a received call through but it usually gets dropped quickly.

And they told me that if there was a weak signal outside, then the signal would be weak inside. If that is true, I wonder about the claims that it will boost the signal by six times.

I was hoping the Voyager 855 would serve double-duty and replace both headset and headphones while also giving me the convenience of bluetooth wireless connectivity to my phone, laptop, and music player. The build quality of the Voyager 855 is excellent. The headset is well put together, the buttons are easy to use, and the earbuds and ear hook are easy to adjust and fit comfortably. I have one complaint with the cord that connects the stereo earbud; if I turn my head, I can hear the cord rubbing against the back of my shirt or neck quite loudly as the vibrations are transmitted directly into my ear. The call quality of the Voyager 855 is also excellent, much better than the Samsung WEP200. There is practically no difference audible to me or the other listener when using the headset. The sliding boom brings the microphone closer to my mouth so that I'm still clearly audible and the earbud delivers acceptable sound to my ear. The music quality, however, leaves much to be desired. There is practically no bass to speak of and the sound is generally tinny and weak. It sounds like I'm listening to music through a telephone. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised, but I was hoping that a headset advertised for music playback would be a cut above the typical headset sound quality.

"I've had this phone for going on 4 days now. I've pretty much made up my made to take it back and exchange for something different. Don't get me wrong, this is a nice phone. It seems to be pretty durable, except for the flimsy cover that is on the charging port - it will break off, I'm 100% sure of that. It's a nice looking phone...I held it up to the Samsung Sync and in my opinion it looks better then that due to the Sync looks like a toy due to the plastic. For the price, the phone has a ton of features! I'm not going to go and list pro's/con's but I will touch base on why I am not satisfied with this phone. Since these features or non features are not listed when you go into the store. Why I am returning: - The ring is ascending ONLY! There is no way to fix this...by the time its loud enough for me to hear it, the caller has hung up (VERY annoying) - Ring tones are horrible - You cannot customize your contacts. Meaning no assignable ring tones or photo ID. - Every time you go to write a text message, and you have to stop or start over, it saves to draft. - A very annoying alert tone every time you access something from a menu. For instance, take a picture and then go to options to delete or send - you get an annoying chime. So if any of these issues are important for you to have on a phone, then don't buy this one. If they don't really matter then check it out cause you will probably enjoy this phone.",negative,neutral,0.4854913019416885,0.5105978419438563,0.003910856114455239

I have been using the Powerpak Itorch for a few days now and it has already become one of my favorite gadgets. We have two Iphone's and two Ipad's in my home and we are constantly charging them. The Itorch has made this task a much easier process. I generally charge the Itorch on a nightly basis and then just use it throughout the day to charge my devices as they need it. I find it so much easier to charge my Ipad with the Itorch rather than a wall outlet. I can sit on my couch and continue whatever I was doing without having to worry about sitting by the outlet etc. I already own another New Trent charger that I use for backpacking trips and times when I need to be able to charge several times. This new Itorch device is a great lightweight charger that has quickly become my favorite day to day charger when I am only going to need 2-3 charges.

"I've had this phone for over 2 years. It may be stylish and touted as a music phone, but really, music is the last thing you want this phone for. It's excellent at being a -phone-: contacts, ringtones, calendar and TXT are easy to navigate. Otherwise, you'll have to compromise with the phone to get what you want. INTERNAL FEATURES REVIEW: The only way to get music and customizable ringtones are to DL them through Verizon; or to buy a data cable and hack the internal memory with PC apps, which takes a bit of work. As for Bluetooth, this feature is a joke. While you're able to connect to headsets, and even other phones, you are unable to transfer files wirelessly between them. This phone is Vcast enabled which is very cool, but also completely useless in 2 situations: if 1) you don't subscribe to Vcast, or 2) you are in a remote area with only extended coverage (roaming). The phone has some quirks like voice command and audio recorder, but most newer phones do, too. For anything sound-wise, there are 4 possible folders: My Ringtones, My Music, My Sounds, and My MP3s (shows up when you enable MP3s under Services after entering the 6-digit code). My Sounds are useless. You can play or record short clips and that's it. My MP3s is best for utilizing the media player, and My Music is very sketchy - sometimes songs work, sometimes they don't - sometimes they just cut off. My Ringtones has an annoying feature wherein you can't delete prepackaged tones (which are -horrible-). There are a total of 27MB of internal memory and 6.27MB of internal RAM, with an unevenly divided amount allocated between features- PIX/FLIX, 4MB; and Ringtone, 2.02MB. Vcast and apps take up the most memory and will depend on what you DL. I store everything on external memory, speaking of which... EXTERNAL FEATURES REVIEW: External memory is in the form of MiniSD - which has now been replaced by MicroSD, so there is an external memory compatibility issue between the VX8100 and newer phones, such as the Chocolate. The phone looks cool with music player buttons on the front, but they're generally useless. The camera is nothing special at 1.3MP, though it does have flash and a relatively quick shutter speed. The camera is a bit awkward- it has no mirror and the only way to see yourself in the front screen is to close the phone. It also takes low-quality MPEG movies with a limit of 15 seconds. The phone itself is bulky and heavy, but it is very durable; I drop it on the street/sidewalk all the time and though the casing may suffer for it, the phone still works fine. The audio speakers are very decent when playing music and comes with an adjustable synthesizer. The battery it comes with will probably not last longer than a year or so - you will need to buy a new one at about $50. Also, these batteries have a very short life, lasting 1 or two days at best with minimal usage; the phone also has a quick charge time, however. __RATING__ LOOKS: 4/5 DURABILITY: 5/5 CUSTOMIZABILITY: 1/5 MUSIC: 2/5 TXT/CALLING: 4/5 TOOLS/EXTRAS: 4/5 MAINTENANCE: 3/5 MEMORY: 2/5 --OVERALL-- 3/5 WHO SHOULD BUY: Homemakers, Senior citizens, Non-technical professionals, Students.

"I read some of the reviews and hesitated to buy this, as I was afraid I would encounter the buzzing feedback noise that some people have been complaining about (Kensington actually has a fix, btw -- they will ship you a free ground loop isolator, which is supposed to fix the problem, though this sounds like a real hassle to my ears). Anyway, I went ahead an ordered this and took a chance because it sounded like exactly the type of thing I needed to use with my iPhone 3GS in my '07 Subaru Outback. I figured that I would just send it back to Amazon if I encountered any buzzing. The upshot is that I got this device, and the setup was super easy -- up and running in under 5 minutes. Then came the moment of truth: how would it sound? Well... I'm happy to report that it works and sounds great -- no buzzing at all (maybe the feedback that a few other people are experiencing is a function of the vehicle they're driving?). The sound is rich and full bodied and makes the stock stereo actually sound halfway decent. Phone conversations work like a dream. The only real downside of using it with the iPhone is that you can only use the remote to play/pause. The Next Track and Previous Track buttons don't work at all, which I understand is a problem with the way Bluetooth has been implemented on the iPhone. This is a small thing (for me at least) because the rest of the functions all work as advertised. Once you've paired the LiquidAux Bluetooth with your iPhone, just make sure Bluetooth is turned on on your iPhone, and then every time you start up your car, you're just set to start streaming audio (music and phone) to the device and out through aux cable to your stereo. Pros: - Very easy to set up - Sound quality is excellent, both for music and for phone conversations - Excellent value for the money. Adds Bluetooth functionality to your car for a fraction of the cost that car manufacturers charge to have built-in Bluetooth. - On my vehicle, it installs in a very low profile. Don't even notice it's there. They definitely didn't feel the need to have lots of bright and distracting flashing lights. - Once paired, it reconnects with the iPhone very quickly -- as soon as you start up your car. - Charges your iPhone (you have to provide a USB to iPhone cable, though) - No wires to your iPhone (unless you choose to charge the iPhone with the cable). - A female-male aux extension cable is included if you need to run the Aux cable further (I did.) Cons: - You still have at least one wire (the one that goes to the Aux jack in your car) -- two wires if you're charging your phone, too. - You need to buy something extra so that you can have someplace handy to put your phone if you don't want it floating around the cup holders or console or wherever (I got the Kensington windshield iPhone mount -- works great --&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kensington-Windshield-suction-mount/dp/B000W0ATGS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kensington - Windshield suction mount</a>) - Some people have complained about a buzzing feedback noise from the engine. This hasn't been a problem for me ('07 Subaru Outback). - With iPhone, only the play/pause button works for music on the remote. In any case, I think the pros greatly outweigh the cons for me, and so I highly recommend this device to iPhone users, though YMMV regarding the buzzing noise.",positive,positive,0.0159761817827213,0.1227977306044265,0.8612260876128521

"I am coming off about 2 years of using first the LG-700 Bluetooth headphones and then the LG-730's. I liked both sets although neither pair held up well to my daily use as both phone headset and music headphones at gym. After misplacing the LG-730's which had started to malfunction, I picked up the Motorola Buds SF500 White at Best Buy with minimal Amazon review checking. Unboxing I had to charge as it appeared dead out of the box, but it charged pretty quickly. After familiarizing myself with the controls, I paired with my iPhone 4s. This first pairing went smooth as expected and I could easily play and navigate music on the iPhone. After a few minutes of use I noticed the small buds kept falling out of my ears so I swapped to the medium size buds. These fit fine and with the fit came a somewhat noticeable increase in sound quality as the medium sealed in my ear better. I have read reviews that others have had the same poor sound result with bad fit, and I would recommend that the first order of business with these headphones is to swap the buds to get the proper ear fit. Then I attempted to make a phone call. First attempt was met with a voice response: ""EQ Changed"". The user guide suggests that the same button press combination will change the EQ and place a call. Apparantly if music is on, holding down the Play/Call button will change the EQ. If music is not on, holding down the button is supposed to invoke Siri. It does not on first attempt. It ALWAYS changes the EQ, like it or not. The second press and hold will invoke Siri. Annoying for sure, but not a deal breaker, especially as the SF500 give no indication as to what the EQ might be set to anyway. Next issue I encountered is pairing. The user guide gives NO indication how to unpair a device from the headset itself. There is a reset operation that is invoked with a press of the Play/Call and both Volume buttons simultaneously. I have yet to achieve a reset via this method. Big Fail. I am forced to unpair from my device iPad/iPhone/Macbook before I can pair to another. I found myself at the gym today with my child in kid care with my ipad and my headphones were paired to it. They could not be unpaired. I got to hear Clash of Clans being played on my ipad from about 100 feet away and not the music on my iphone 2 feet away. The good news, I guess, is that the range is much better than either LG set. When it is paired, I really like the fit and the stiffness of this headset over the LG. I suppose if you have a bigger neck the fit could be a problem, but I frankly forget I have it on. The sound is marginally better than the LG-700 and much better than the LG-730, which was never that great. Call quality seems to be OK when I can get past the ""EQ Changed"" annoyance. The fit becomes a bigger deal as you start to exercise. The LG's would fall off due to their flex-y nature. The SF500 seems to stay in place well due to the stiffness. So good sound, good fit, annoying controls.",neutral,neutral,0.0957712179932472,0.8331551379173973,0.07107364408935549
first off Ronald is 100% wrong on the MP3 function. YOU do need to purchase from VCAST or buy the kit. you can purchase a Micro SD card and a card reader. then transfer the songs to the card. OR you can purchase a data cable (look on ebay for them cheap) and transfer them. i suggest getting a card reader. it is far faster. as for the ringtones yes there are only a few. but do a search on the phone and there are sites that show you how to make a MP3 ringtone and put it on the SD card.

"I bought this product to transfer photos from an older LG phone. Unfortunately that didn't work but that has nothing to do with the cable, but the phone itself. However, on the third time I attempted to plug the cable into the phone because my computer was having trouble recognizing the phone, the casing around the smaller end of the cable, the end that goes into the phone, shattered in my hand, leaving the wires exposed. The cord still works, but I'll have to fix it with electrical tape if I want to try to use it again. So either be very careful handling this cord, or perhaps find one that costs a bit more and might be more sturdy.",neutral,neutral,0.12930292910008925,0.8664694302347721,0.004227640665138637
"As of this writing, I've had this unit for about 2 months, and I've used it daily. I paired mine with an LG ""Voyager"" VX10000 (which has voice recognition software). I've found it has excellent sound, and it's range seems to be about 15 feet (less with walls). HOWEVER, as others have already reported, the ear loops are poorly designed, uncomfortable, and not reversible. Also, the manual is overly terse and unhelpful, and the unit is somewhat difficult to detach from it's charger, once connected. Brief digression: I also wish this (and most other bluetooths for that matter) had a ""locate"" tone, so that if you mislaid the earpiece, you could use your cell phone to locate it by making it chirp. I mean c'mon ... it has a low battery and an on/off tone, so why not an ""I'm over here !"" tone ? Anyway, in a crowded field of wireless earpieces (which many people either love or hate, regardless of make and moder), this one seems to be above somewhat average. If sound quality is your most important criteria (especially if you use voice recognition to dial), I can recommend this unit. On the other hand, if your foremost criteria is comfort, a reasonably well written manual, and simple idiot-proof features, look elsewhere.",neutral,neutral,0.009239535166548941,0.8449938648230545,0.14576660001039643

On average, more than once a week. Also, very annoying. Windows Mobile is about as stable as Brittney Spears on a weekend in Vegas. - BATTERY: Battery power is very limited, particularly in Wi-Fi. normal battery power is o.k., but Wi-Fi sucks a LOT of power.

"Hi, I had total of 2 of these headsets and I actually liked the headset at first because of the way it fit my ear, which was very tight and sturdy. The very first one that I bought I had troubles to get it connected to my phone right away, which what I thought at first could be a compatibility issue with my phone, even though my previous headset (Motorola H375 - see my review about it) NEVER had this types of connectivity issues (but it did have some durability issues of it's own). So after playing around with it I ended up doing a hard reset on my phone, after which I was able to finally get it connected. I've been using this headset for about 3 months, during which I had some connection issues every now and then, but I was always able to get it resolved each time after playing around with the settings and the phone, which in some cases took quite a while. Anyways, the last month the connections issues started happening more and more often and one day my phone wouldn't see the headset at all. I tried my old cell phone and my wife's cell phone to recognize the headset, but neither one would ""see"" it, even though the headset itself seemed to power up and making appropriate sounds as if it was in a pairing mode. Ok, I thought maybe it was my bad luck with getting a defective piece, so, since I REALLY liked the durability and fit of this particular headset, I went online and ordered another brand new headset just like this. The story with this one was that it would power up but none of my phones would be able to recognize it from the very beginning after I received it, so I am sending this 2nd one back for a refund and looking for another substitute in the meantime. Even though I really liked the way it fit my ear, I will not waste another dollar or a minute of my time trying to get one of these to work. For all these reasons I do not recommend anyone to buy it. Try something else and hopefully you will have a better luck with it. Cheers!",negative,negative,0.9144268921246241,0.08169679826533958,0.003876309610036345

"I bought this to work with my iPhone. I usually only buy noise canceling headsets, as I use these mostly when driving with the air conditioning running full blast. So, lets start with the good. This is one of the smallest headsets I've ever seen. It comes with plenty of accessories, such as a desktop dock, and a travel dock. It fits comfortably out of the box with no need for adjustment. The clarity when running at it's peak is one of the clearest I've heard. The downside. The build quality of this is awful. It feels like anything can break it in half, doing anything with it. Because of this, if I want to put it in my pocket, I need to put it in the travel dock, negating the purpose of it's size. If I want to put it somewhere in my car, once again, I have to put it in the travel dock. This wouldn't be such a problem, but the top to the travel dock is so tight, that when you pull the top off, the headset loses contact with the magnetic connector, causing it to fly out of the case. This isn't a one time thing. This happens every single time. The noise canceling on this device is also the worst I've ever used. I've had several people hang up on me because of their inability to understand me when driving. This is completely unacceptable for a headset that claims to have ClearTalk or whatever it is they are calling it. After less then 15 minutes of having it plugged in, and having it on the clarity of calls goes down hill. I was on the phone with AT&T making adjustments to my data plan, and had to hold my iPhone up to my head just for what she was saying to be clear at all. Beyond that, I've had the headset for a total of 9 days, and the headset is now almost instantly starts playing the low battery sound, and goes dead within 5 minutes of being unplugged. Thats not on the phone, thats simply being unplugged. Before writing this review, I did some research on this headset, out of fear that I would be too harsh on this device. The static has been well documented in other reviews, as well as the noise canceling not being as good as expected. As far as the battery life goes, this could easily be a fluke with this one single unit. With all of this said, this is marketed as a higher end bluetooth headset. While this maybe acceptable as a lower tier model, the constant static, and the seemingly non-existent noise canceling I can't say I'd recommend this. If you buy this, expect a beautiful, yet fragile headset, with entry level performance. I have all ready submitted my request for a refund on this.",negative,negative,0.8760096813109474,0.04885598234042425,0.07513433634862837

"The instruction manual says the earbuds should fit 'snugly' in the ear. Ha!! Unlike other bluetooth headsets, this one requires that the vibration sensor rest against your cheekbone. that contact creates a little bit of pressure/leverage that is pulling the bud out of the ear canal. everytime you move your jaw as you talk you're also helping dislodge the earbud. And the earbuds they provide are not the soft silicone kind that fit to the shape of your ear and make a great sound shield. These buds are hard plastic and the shapes not nearly as varied as they need to be in order for you to get a good variety. the tip they attach to also cannot flex. most ear canals do not go into the head at a right angle, so why does jawbone design an earbud that extends at a right angle to the device?! what's so maddening is that it's not that hard to make a good earbud. how they messed this up is beyond me.",negative,neutral,0.17044297802814035,0.7545625418061794,0.07499448016568025

However, as soon as the level of noise increased in the area you are calling it becomes very difficult to hear. I think the problem is the ear piece.

"While this piece does what it sets out to do, namely integrating an aftermarket head unit into the factory climate controls and displays, the fit and finish are not exemplary by any means. I've used other Metra kits over the years and most of them are simple radio surround pieces - this is the fist one that necessitated replacing the entire center section of the dash. When doing this install (which was fairly straightforward) I discovered that the piece I received was oversized for my dash by a few millimeters. Consequently it has a tendency to pop out of the dash. Secondly, the chrome stripes from the factory dash piece are missing so the finish is different as well. Thirdly, the hazard button is an awful piece of workmanship using the least expensive version of pushbutton possible. My next step is to see if I can take the electronics from the Metra piece and mount them onto the factory dash piece and work the faceplate in with a bit of bondo, sanding and refinishing for a custom look.

"Dear Amazon, I used to be able to jump all over the car whenever my dad took me for a ride. But then one day I accidentally bonked the baby and my dad said he was getting a ""barrier"" so I wouldn't do that anymore. I didn't know what a ""barrier"" was, so I just assumed it was food. Not only did your shipment arrive a day earlier, but it was definitely not food, even more to my disappointment. I had some entertainment as my dad puzzled over the directions. He said something about poorly-illustrated diagrams and used a few uh-oh words, but when he was done, I didn't like the way this looked. He went out to our Jeep Patriot, and after about 5 minutes came inside and put my leash on and told me we were going bye-bye in the car. I LOVE THE CAR!!! MY FAVORITE THING!!! He loaded me in the cargo area... Ha! Like I'm going to stay THERE! -Except now this ""barrier"" thing was sitting right against the backseat. Dad stopped the car and hopped out to pump gas. Much to my dismay, I could no longer hop over the seats to scrounge for any cereal or crackers the baby had dropped. Nor could I sit in Dad's seat and pant and drool all over his steering wheel. I'm not an overly-active dog, but it's pretty solidly in place; I don't think I could get past this without weighing an extra 50 pounds and making a serious effort. *sigh* all those crackers are just going to go to waste when Dad vacuums out the car now. I hate this barrier, but for what it's worth, my dad likes it... although he said the instructions could have been better. Because they made him say a few uh-oh words, I decided to give this 4 stars instead of 5. -Max the dog PS: Is it possible for me to exchange this for ham?",positive,negative,0.7148620427466112,0.14599458711485094,0.1391433701385378

I am very pleased with the bluetooth portion of the Plantronics Voyager 855 that I ordered. It works really well and seems to have good clarity and volume on both ends of the calls. I am very frustrated with the wireless stereo headset/bluetooth option. The connector piece for this option was cracked/defective upon receipt and when I tried to install it the piece broke. Now I cannot use the wireless headphones to listen to music while working out. I contacted the company that sent me the devise and they still have not responded; it has been several weeks and nothing. Perhaps Amazon will get involved and assist me as I am sure they do not want companies who do not stand behind their products and service selling products and profiting from these transactions using the Amazon.com name/website.

"I still love Jawbone in general, and love the form factor of the new one. I find it more subtle than the previous one and not just because it's half the size--the black one seems quite discrete. I have to problems however. First, the thing turns on with just a feather touch. Which means when I carry it in my shirt pocket, it's always turning on. Even when stowed in my briefcase, the thing turns on. Needs some sort of hard case to protect that. Second, personally I've found it harder to get a good fit than the previous one. The previous one, with the metal ear hooks, could be custom fit. While it was a pain to put on, once on it wasn't going anywhere. This new one is easier to put on but is less secure on my head. And when I can't hear someone, my tendency is to push the device closer to my ear--but with the new one, this invariably cancels the call because again, the switches are so sensitive.

It is loud and clear, noise cancelling function is very effective, and the voice command capability is brilliant. The problem is that the headset will not stay in my ear. The ear clip worked reasonably well when I first bought this, but the rubber bushing soon after became stretched and would not hold the ear clip in place. I have since tried different methods to keep it from flopping around, but eventually it falls apart. It seems to me that a company capable of designing such a technologically superior device could have come up with a more effective method for keeping it on your head. Let's hope that blueant corrects this with their next release.",neutral,neutral,0.24081511612923365,0.6150196823616009,0.14416520150916548

"This device I have been using for a year now and it works very well. Microphone placement is very important so plan this part well to be sure that it picks up the least amount of road noise since it is very sensitive. All features that I use including voice dial and standard calling from recent calls and contact list works well. The only thing I ran into is that contacts that are in your phone from social networks such as linked-in or facebook do not sync to this device so you will need to enter these into your phones contact list if you want them on the device. Other than this, fantastic device, handsfree and worry free calling in California. I should mention that if you have a Dodge Caliber (probably others too), it will require an $80 harness for connection to your speakers due to the way that the radio control handles sound to the speakers so check this first before you buy.

The product is okay but could be better. The first problem I had was one of the latches came off immediately upon receipt of the item while trying to open it for the first time. One is easy to open but the other sticks so it requires some extra force to open. The latches are apparently designed to be removable so I was able to just slide it back in place but since it is so hard to unlatch I have pulled it totally off on three occasions now. I could just glue it in place but the fact that it is removable makes me wonder if the manufacturer is planning on it breaking eventually. Why else would it be designed so it can be easily removed? The second problem I had came after flying with it. There is no pressure release valve on it and after getting to my hotel I attempted to open this case and could not. I had to use a pocket knife to pry it open which is fine when I am on the ground but not so fine when I am on a plane where I am not allowed to have a knife. Upon returning home after another flight I was able to get the case open without my knife but it was not very easy. Since I bought it to keep some battery backups in for long flights it I don't think it will work for my needs. Edited to Add: So far I have not had any issues opening the box while on a plane. I still have problems after I land as sometimes it need to be pried open but at least while in the air it opens fine. I am still using it but be aware that if you fly with it you may need a tool to pry it open after landing.,neutral,neutral,0.05120701438756605,0.9334933069864153,0.015299678626018822

"After moving to the US from overseas, I needed a pre-paid SIM for my iphone. The at&t go phone SIM was exactly what I needed. After reading the customer reviews, I realised that some people had difficulties activating the SIM and for others it worked well. I thought $6.00 it's worth a shot. The product arrived super fast. I was very impressed. I was sent the cell antenna and the SIM card sticky taped to it (no instructions, cell number or pin). I'm pretty good with using the internet so I found the activation site on the at&t website. The activation went well until the last stage where the data is being processed. I kept getting an error message from the at&t website ""error GP038 activation taking longer than normal. Please try again"". I tried calling the at&t customer service line but the automated messages ask for a cell number which I don't have. I contacted the seller for instructions and they were very prompt in replying and gave me a web address which took me to the site I was originally at (I was kinda hoping for more detailed instructions). After further detective work and watching ""how to"" videos on 'You Tube' I found the solution to my problem and got my SIM activated and a new cell number was issued. I think my activation difficulties were to do with at&t (their horrible website) & the fact I had an iphone.

I have had this headset for about 3 months now. The noise reduction is remarkable. I can be in a airport and no one even knows I am out of my office. Wind is a problem with this headset as with any other headset. The noise reduction does not reduce wind noise. If it's a windy day you are out of luck but I don't know of any headset that works that way. Sound - The sound is a little tinny but you get used to it pretty quickly. Comfort - I have owned at least a dozen Bluetooth headsets and this is by far the most comfortable. There are different clips and ear pieces that come with the headset. I have worn it for over 8 hours straight and don't even know it's there. Charging - Propriety USB charger that plugs into the back of the phone. They also supply a plug for an outlet so you can charge it without your computer. I bought 2 chargers one for home and one for my laptop bag. Battery - Very good battery life. I cannot remember exact times but I use it often every day and have not run out of charge yet. Storage - This is the one thing that is a pain. It does not come in a case and putting it in your pocket is a real pain. I know this is trivial but I wish there was a case for it when I am not wearing it.

"I installed this unit according to instructions. I installed the antenna where the strongest signal was (2 bars). The unit did work but not to what I needed. I could only get a signal maybe no more than 10-15 feet from the antenna. I ordered the option booster indoor antenna and it helped a little but not much more. Maybe 20 feet. I needed the unit to cover more area and this only covers the room you are in, if the room is not larger than maybe 20 feet. I ended up installing it at my inlaws camp where they don't have a useable signal inside or outside. This worked with a weak signal on their roof but gives them plenty of signal for their camp to make calls. About five feet from the inside antenna you will get 3-4 bars. It decreases of course, the further you move away. If you need service in one room, I would recommend this unit. Otherwise, upgrade to something for the whole house. One thing to note: Signal bar strength is not an indicator for actual signal strength. A device that measures db's would be needed for this if your phone cannot be put into test mode. My can but it reported a number that was not a db. This device would allow you to point your outside antenna toward the strongest signal.

"I own two different Motorola Headsets, and with both of them, I get frequent complaints that the person I'm calling can't hear me clearly. It may be that I have a very wide face, and the microsphone is too far from my mouth. I'm not really sure why, but regardless, I've been looking for a new headset. I heard about the Jawbone's remarkable noise cancellation features, and thought perhaps it might solve the problem by doing a better job of picking out my voice from surrounding. It didn't. In fact, it's the worst headset I've ever used. Never mind the fact that it's cheaply made. Never mind that the buttons are too stiff and hard to use. Never mind that the ear hook is a real pain to get over my ear... All these things might be forgiven. The real problem is that it simply doesn't work for me. I initially spent a bit of time trying out the different earbuds and hooks to find a combination that would give the voice sensor good contact with my face, as I had heard that this was an important factor. I then tried a few (unfair) experiments to see how it worked. I called myself on my land line, and I got feedback when held the handset in the normal position on my off ear. When I covered the mouthpiece, the feedback went away, but I still got poor sound quality. I thought that perhaps the sound conducting through my head from the handset might be confusing the noise reduction, so I put my land line on speakerphone. I got an interesting reverb effect which indicated that the noise suppression didn't work well when it was trying to suppress my voice on a time delay, but again, this wasn't a fair test. So I called someone. They kept asking if I was there. I kept repeating myself. Apparently, I dropped in and out, and when I wasn't talking, the line was totally silent, without the usual slight background noise that cues the person on the other end that you're still there. I tried calling several different people. I tried adjusting the position of the earpiece. Uniformly, the people I called reported that my voice kept dropping out. I'll be returning my Jawbone tomorrow and resuming my search for a headset that works for me.",negative,negative,0.8133415095406609,0.18561038649737666,0.0010481039619623562

"Overall, the Motorola Buds are a decent Bluetooth headset. The sound quality for phone calls and music is good, and they are comfortable to wear. I use them with an iPhone 6 and they work well with it. I have tested walking about 50 feet away from my phone and the sound is perfect, even with a couple walls in the way. I have a few things that I wish were better, though, which is why I deducted one star: 1. There is no way to tell the battery status until it is low and the headset tells you. Then you only have 5 or 10 minutes before the battery is completely dead. Other headsets have a battery indicator on the phone screen; no such thing with these. Even the ability to press a button and have it tell you approximately how much time is left would be helpful, but again this headset doesn't do this. (Maybe with an Android phone? But I don't know.) 2. The microphone is extremely sensitive. I'm not sure what Motorola considers ""noise canceling"", but it doesn't appear that this headset has any. I have used Jawbone headsets in the past and those things are amazing at noise cancellation. But the Motorola Buds picks up people talking at normal levels in the other room and it is heard by the caller. 3. When watching a video, the sound is not synchronized with the video. I don't know if this is just something with all Bluetooth headsets, but it is a bit confusing when the mouth moves then you hear the words a 1/2 second or so later, almost like an old Japanese kung fu movie.

"Its an ok phone that would be my starting title! why is this, its because the phone its relatively a good phone but you cant compare it to an iPhone after using an iPhone you are just expecting the same features as the iPhone. This is because this phone doesnt let me use an app to check my mac.com email directly from the phone like my iPhone neither its going to be easy setting it up your yahoo or any other non-microsoft application. Youtube works and you can see it ok but not as good as the os from mac that is installed in the iPhone, btw i bought this phone because i was sick and tired of doing workarounds to my hacked iphone so i could use it here in the Republic of Panama. This is a great phone when we talk about the wifi which it gives you a good signal but this phone is not so user friendly and is kinda hard for a person to set it up to make it look like its part of you. This phone has great games though, the screen is great and the 2 megapixels are great! it has great features as video, video calls, night mode, etc!

"Yes, this item works well. But yes, it takes some RF and electronics knowledge to make it work right. For me, I have verizon cell phones operating in the 800MHZ cell band in my area. In my house we had zero to 1 bar and could make calls but they were frequently dropped or cut in and out. We could walk down the block and the signal was better. Our house sits in a depression and most of the cell signal was going over the top of our house. To really make this thing work well I would recommend the following tips: 1) Get cell phone for which you know how to enable DEBUG mode and get an actual NUMBER for the signal strength it is receiving. 2) Go ahead and purchase the optional YAGI directional antenna for this unit. 3) Buy an approximately 4 x 8 ft. piece of radiant barrier ( a type of insulation available at home depot made of aluminum). 4) Mount YAGI antenna in rafters of house or outside on roof. 5) Mount cell extender about 3 feet from the floor in the top living level of your house in a center location of the house. 6) Place radiant barrier in attick directly between the 2 antennas. This will help improve the signal separation a lot and will make this thing work. 7) Power up cell extender. If when you power it up you get ANY flashing amber lights, then your signal isolation between the two antennas isn't good enough and you must do something about it (move antennas, get YAGI with higher gain, etc.) If you get no amber lights on startup then the device is operating at max or almost max amplification and power output (only 1/2 watt but plenty for a single house). We now have 3-5 bars all over our house, deck, porch, and even garage! Calls are clear and there is no breaking up or dropping of calls. We have 2700 sq ft. house with 2 stories plus a basement. I am using a 10dbi antenna from some guys out of New York I found on the internet. I paid $99 for this antenna because they told me it was a 17dbi antenna, but they lied. However, it works and I am happy with what works... Running continously for 2 months now without a single glitch. Zero maintenance when installed correctly.

"Users have 2 choices; buy the original Moto version for about $12-15 each, or a clone for as low at $1-3. In prior phones I've used with similar side snap-on belt clips, the 'clones', whose manufacturer is unknown except it isn't brand-named with Moto and comes with no warranty, has lasted me 4-6mo before its clip breaks off, less commonly it lasts longer. The Moto one is guaranteed for a year, and it literally lasts 12-18mo before it too breaks. Doing the math, the Moto version will run the user 0.67-1.00 a month. The clones $0.16-0.75 a month. The clone's value depends on how much you buy it for. This $6 version, which if not guaranteed, will not be a good value if it breaks within 6 months. Don't forget shipping and handling. I buy these clips from OEM for $1 a piece in lots of 30. Why a clip versus a belt case? Dust free and small profile other than pocketing the phone. My friends who use a phone case phone in it end up getting dust inside the LCD screen. The case itself get very ratty looking as it ages, and the threads wear off before the clip breaks. In the snap clip, the phone 'breathes' and stays clean. However, if you are in a rough job site, where the phones can snapped out of your holster and dropped, it may pay to get something more secure and bulky. Further, the phone can also be bumped and scratched if it's very exposed. The holster is best if you wear a jacket or coat continuously. This protects the phone yet makes it easy to access on your hip. The belt clip mount is ideal for those who prefer the phone vibrate rather than ring. The phone snaps into the holster, and pushing the top snap releases the phone quickly. The rotating version allows the user to angle the phone from 0-180 in 20 degrees clicks, so it can be mounted on either the left or right hip angled the same way. This rotation feature is the clips weakness, this is the site that breaks. There is a non-rotating clip that should last longer, since the clip is built into the case as one piece. Only if the plastic fatigues from overuse will it eventually break. Alas, with the phone sitting upright, the antennae occassionally pokes you in the side. If this clip were made of aluminum rather than plastic it would be worth $15-20 and last longer. Alas, both the original Moto and OEMs are not durable, and its just a question of bad to worst when it comes to durability.",neutral,neutral,0.3311853786801951,0.6078017571173046,0.06101286420250025

"I think I spent a good 10-12 hours researching which ""voice isolation"" bluetooth I'd buy. I've tried many different brands and my last one, Plantronics Voyager 510, just wasn't cutting it though it was comfortable. The final decision came down to Blueant Z9 or Aliph Jawbone. After countless reading of user reviews, it seemed that many people complained that the Jawbone was uncomfortable (though a modification was available) and some complained of poor voice isolation. The BlueAnt Z9 seemed to have mostly excellent reviews except for ""customer service"" reviews (poor). Anyhow, after barely two days of owning it I've come to realize that it just doesn't perform as expected. The good: 1) It's comfortable if you have a small to medium thin ear. 2) You can hear the other person fairly clearly 3) The engineering and craftmanship is outstanding 4) The packaging is impressive though a bit tedious to open! The bad: 1) Voice isolation doesn't work even with the latest upgrade (v4.3). I've tried it INSIDE my car with the windows UP and no radio, and the receiver actually told me that it was picking up A LOT of background noise. In fact, the receiver wanted to hang up because it was THAT BAD. Even at voice isolation MAX, it would pick up a lot of interior noise when it was DEAD quiet in my car, could this have been a defective unit? MAYBE. 2) Upgrading the firmware is tricky. First you have to load a driver (and fiddle in Device Manager), restart your PC, then hold the VOL+ button, and then while holding connect your bluetooth. Not exactly ""plug and play"" that an average person would have the patience for. 3) The charging connector looks sensitive. It's a USB style (similar to a Blackberry style) home-charger that may become ""loose"" after many charges. Just a minor nuisance, but probably not a flaw in engineering. Bottom line: I would recommend this bluetooth if you have the patience to try it out. Perhaps mine was indeed defective, but the voice isolation certaintly wasn't as ""great"" as other users and professional reviews suggested.",negative,negative,0.761620284901918,0.2054264564100471,0.032953258688035045
"I've used the earset with and without it's extra noise-cancellation feature and in many different situations including on noisy streets and in cars. The sound transmission, as determined by people on the other end of my calls, is no better than my other plantronic earset, which I purchased a few years ago. So for that ""averageness"" I give it 4 stars. However, I subtract one star for the miserable design of the ear bud, and another star for Blue Ant's failure to acknowledge their warranty. The rubber of the ear bud disintegrated within 3 months of using the product. When I asked Blue Ant to replace the accessory they did but said that it wasn't covered by their warranty: ""In the manual it states that it is a 2 year Hardware warranty. Hardware excludes the accessories (ear buds, chargers etc). However, we will in this instance send you one complimentary ear bud when they arrive in the office."" Well, Blue Ant, sending me one extra ear bud when they disintegrate every 3 months ain't gonna cut it.",negative,negative,0.43748210148767275,0.3634604252132883,0.19905747329903897

"Part ONE (the upgrade for folks who HAVE the Jabra BT800): The manufacturer's (free) website has a link to download an UPGRADE to the existing Jabra BT800. This reviewer cautions you to follow the manufacturer's downloading instructions EXPLICITLY. In case you are drunk, stoned, distracted by your Little Darlings, recovering from an all-too-fresh spat with your spouse, or were actually heading out the door before you changed your mind and now wish to ""quickly"" get this upgrade thing over and done with: STOP. Do not proceed until your misguided enthusiam has dissipated and you can PAY ATTENTION, FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS, and WAIT PATIENTLY. The whole idea of an upgrade is to render your Jabra BT800 even more up-to-date than it was when the manufacturer first released it on us. Should you attempt to hurry up the step-by-step process, or should you somehow interrupt the process midway, you DEFEAT the goal. The details are spelled out on the upgrade page for the BT800 on the Jabra site. Most of you do not need to ever ""upgrade"" your BT800; nevertheless, there are advantages: - faster audio transfer for (Sony-)Ericsson phones - faster speech channel handling; the call is transferred to the headset more quickly - faster reaction on key-presses during incoming calls - The missing international prefix ""+"" is displayed in your caller list, thus allowing you to dial out from your Jabra BT800 Part TWO (for folks who want to double-check that their make/model Bluetooth phone is compatible with the BT800 before ordering the BT800 for it): The Jabra website has a Navigation Bar tab entitled ""Support"". On the Support page there is a COMPATIBILITY GUIDE box or hypertext LINK. Slow down; pay attention: you MUST turn on Session Cookies _before_ you click. The Compatibility Guide will STONEWALL you if you try to navigate the three drop-down menus with the Cookies disabled. I myself successfully obtained their Result by setting the Cookie option to ""Prompt"" and rejecting the long-term (year 2020) Cookies from Jabra. Session Cookies ARE A MUST, and you can hopefully delete them from your PC before you leave their site. Should you receive the message ""... are not compatible."", don't order the BT800 for that particular make/model phone. Plantronics (another good-quality manufacturer) has a Compatibility Guide too, but it's not labeled as such: look for ""Will this work with my existing phone?"" on each of the pages that describe a Plantronics device. I'm not taking sides here. BTW, in case you already have a Motorola or Nextel (made by Motorola) phone, I think that your Bluetooth headphone also ought to be a Motorola. Nextel is weird to start with (they use a soon-to-be replaced by Sprint language called iDen), so definitely look before you leap into a purchase of any Bluetooth compatible headphone. Both Motorola and Plantronics are big companies who know what they are doing, yet Jabra seems to have a feature which makes me gravitate towards some Jabra Bluetooth products: I very much like the GEL BUDS and the MINI GELS that go into the ear. The audio is better (no outside noise), and the COMFORT potential (assuming a correct fit) is fantastic. I withheld one star because of the retail cost; I withheld one star because of the overall weight/SIZE (due to all the extra features tacked on to the BT800). In case sound quality is paramount, and the Bluetooth convenience is secondary, do consider an unknown unit made by Plantronics: the MX505. There are four models (Product Variants) to match your make and model phone. It is part of what Plantronics calls the MX500 Series. The boom mike is actually a TUBE (you get two lengths), which is purposely curved and can be pivoted. The end has a windscreen ((""WindSmart"" technology) to dampen rushing wind (open car window). Soundwise, you won't do better. Looks-wise, it IS techie-looking, not a fashion statement. You won't develop as many wrinkles on your face while struggling to hear or be heard, so you will look better than the equipment. As for the decided convenience of Bluetooth, which enables you to function without any mind-body coordination, the MX505 and/or MX510 (Nokia) has you tethered to your device. The cord is NOT automatically retractable into a reel (the Plantronics MX300 corded headset has a good one), so you must work safely, since you are on a ""leash"".",neutral,negative,0.613517345285711,0.33305942853001,0.053423226184278874

"I love the Otterbox holster for the protection it provides my phone. However, the spring will wear out after nine months or so of use. I had to take the spring out and adjust it so it would work. But it only lasted for a few weeks before the clip was loose again. This model (for the Black Berry Curve 8330) has the ability to swivel (which apparently all of their holsters do, I am told). Again, after nine months or so of use the holster will swivel much too easily. I don't like the ability of the holster to swivel so I fixed that with some screws. I used a screw to fix the clip as well. Customer service from Otter Box is certainly lacking. I contacted them with the following message: Hi. I purchased my Otter Box Defender on May 24, 2009 from Amazon.com LLC. Recently, the belt clip that rotates on the holster is so loose that it rotates on my belt too easily. The spring on the clip itself is so weak that I have had my phone drop off of my belt and land on the floor. Is there any way to replace the rotating belt clip? I love my Otter Box and the protection it gives my phone. I don't want to give it up for something with less protection but has better components. Thank you. The following was the only response received: Update for Case #93443 - ""Holster clip"" If you send me your name address and phone type that we are carrying. Thanks, [name of customer service rep] I don't know what they were going to do to resolve this. I thought that by asking for my name and address they would have sent me another holster. I never heard from them after that. It was (and is) within the one year warranty period. Get the Otterbox if you want the protection it provides but be prepared to make some fixes yourself.

"This has been my first and only phono preamp I've purchased for my system and I'm extremely happy with its performance. I'm using a Rega RP1 turntable, an Onkyo reciever (700 series, about 8 years old at this point), and Polk floorstanding speakers. Even with budget components the system sounds great. The reason I was prompted to write this review after owning the preamp for years was the customer service from Phono Pre-Amps. After two years of fairly regular use, the right channel output inexplicably stopped working. I opened up the unit to see if I could diagnose the problem but with my very limited electronics knowledge I wasn't able to figure it out after poking around with a multimeter. With the clean and simple construction, however, a person with more electronics knowledge could surely have repaired it themselves. Defeated, I contacted the manufacturer customer service and was informed the preamp comes with a limited lifetime warranty and it could be fixed it free of charge. I shipped it to them in December 2014 and within two weeks it was returned to me working like new.

"After 6 months, this thing suddenly stopped sending sound from me to the phone, so while I can hear the other caller, they can't hear me at all. What's crazy is that I replaced it under warranty, and the same exact failure happened again 6 months later! So clearly something is wrong with these units. The only reason I'm giving 2 stars and not 1 is because I really like the design. If I have an incoming call, I can flip out the boom, and put it on the ear quickly while it is connecting to the phone. It also answers the call automatically if turned on while a call is incoming. Putting it on the ear with one hand is super easy. The result is that you can use it ""on demand"", even while driving.

"I got the Motorala RAZR for christmas when I already had an LG that did everything right. Perhaps that is why i'm bitter. Below is a list of things that are irritating about the RAZR. They may be small but it's the small things that I use most often. 1: ....Delay.... There is significant delay for almost every function. Press phone book... wait... press f... wait... call friend. This is the function that is used most often and yet there is about a half second delay after each button is pressed. I'm used to a near instant response from LG phones and older motorolas. This delay is on everything that refreshes the display. I can't stress enough how annoying this is. 2: Max volume is too soft. For example, I was sitting in a department store with the volume of this phone at its maximum and had much trouble hearing what my friend was saying. I had to ask him to repeat himself so many times that we eventually just ended the conversation because it was taking to long to communicate. This happens in most public places and in the car. It's not that you can't hear the person. It's just that it takes too much strain to understand the words that are contaminated with the background noise in these everyday situations. I never had this problem with my previous phone. 3: Alarm Clock interface is poor. This may seem like too small of function to be complaining about but it is common for people to use their cell phone as their daily alarm clock. If you have a regular 9-5 job and don't need to change the times of your alarm the RAZR works okay. Note that there is no Mon-Fri enable option so you will have to remember to enable it every night. If you are a student or if you have irregular work hours this alarm clock is even more annoying. They have you name the alarms rather than just displaying what time the alarm will go off. That way, if you're unsure what time the alarm goes off, you've got to go through some 2 delayed button functions to just see the time. This is just something that really irritates me. If you're used to better, it will irritate you too. 4: Volume button on monitor end of phone rather than the button end, probably because the buttons wouldn't fit there with such a slim design. Just hold one of these phones open in your hand and try to adjust the headset volume as you would during a call. It's an awkward and slow process. The good thing is that the earpiece is so quiet that you could just keep it at full volume for almost any use. It looks cool though. But everybody has one now anyway.",negative,neutral,0.4151528306196095,0.47959881641743607,0.10524835296295451

"goal: the loudest bluetooth speaker phone, the best of the best. i hate head sets. 1. i have owned the motorola T 305 for 2 years. with the new cell law in california, i wanted a hands free bluetooth speaker phone to make my ears bleed with LOUD, CLEAR, QUALITY volume, especially for freeway speeds and when i have my a/c on full blast, my window down and the radio on full blast, yes all at the same time as most people in los angeles. 2. the T 305 be called many things on amazon, but a motorola T 305 is a motorola T 305. the boxes may have changed, but that is all. the T 505 is a T 505 as well. 3. that said, the T 305 has only a small 1 watt speaker, possibly good for a cat or bat - i am neither. the T 305 is ok for quiet people, or people who do not have air conditioning on the highest fan speed, people who rarely use or do not have air conditioning, who do not smoke, do not have kids, never use the radio, never have passangers, never roll down their windows. if that is you, save the few dollars and get the motorola T 305. you will like the 1/one watt speaker and you will be happy. 4. the motorola T 505 has a 2/two watt speaker, enough to make my ears bleed which is what i wanted since i require a loud ring, and yes, i DO roll my window up to talk, but at least i can hear it ring at 75 mph! i am not hard of hearing, but with the window down and the a/c on full blast, i want a loud ring. TRUST ME, 2 WATTS IS MORE THAN LOUD ENOUGH - IT'S QUALITY/LOUDNESS IS MORE THAN JUST DOUBLE THE 1 WATT; 2 WATTS MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD. i do not know why, but it does. 2 WATTS WILL WAKE THE DEAD. 5. back on track, i bought the jabra sp5050, WHICH DOES NOT COME WITH A HOME CHARGER - NO JOKE! jabra's customer service was super, super cool. they even said they were adding a home charger soon and even sent me a free one. motorola's customer service, after you dial 23 prompts, is worthless, regardless of what continent you get sent to. an a+ to jabra's customer service. f- to motorola's. 6. ok, my experience just a few weeks ago was when i charged the jabra sp5050 (in my car of course since there is no home charger), just out of the box. i first loved the cool, stealth design. BUT that is all. i literally did a side by side comparison of the jabra sp5050 vs. the 1/one watt motorola T 305, had my partner call me from inside my home, and the jabra sp5050 was worthless. free or a gift, i would throw it away. BY ME IF FREE OR A GIFT- i would throw it away. i returned it in 2 hours. 7. spend the little extra, get the 2 watt motorola T 505. worth the money, calls can come in over a unused/weak fm frequency. since i am not a terrorist, i don't care if anyone can pick it up my stupid calls next to me in case they are listening to an unused fm frequency. is it perfect, no. i am not flying in a space shuttle or in a fighter jet. *****i would NOT recommend calling a credit card company, however.***** 8. even if you do not need the T 505 to make your ears bleed or scare you if you are deep in thought, the fm broadcasting feature of the incoming voice over an unused fm frequency is really cool. it is so smart, it tells you what fm station to pick. or, you do not have to use this feature if you do not want to. fyi, the speaker volume IS adjustable if you do not want your ears to bleed. the mororola t 505 is a V8 engine, for sure. *********************************************** if legal, i would marry the motorola t 505. ***********************************************",negative,negative,0.8988243229147245,0.08134435771070686,0.019831319374568723

"Overall the phone is pretty good for what it is. A budget wifi capable smart phone. The look style and feel of the phone is great, the headphones broke within a couple weeks and were not very good to begin with. The button never worked well and one speaker quit in about a week. The jack ended up breaking off. The ear pieces never fit well and the volume was not very loud. My next complaint is about the speaker in the phone itself. When the volume is turn up to an adequate level the speaker vibrates against the printed circuit board and creates a buzzing noise. I had to take the phone apart and place a small piece of thin rubber between the speaker and the board to get it to stop. Works well now.

"I purchased the red version of this headset to go with my red Samsung a707 SYNC phone. The color matched up perfectly. Had no issues with pairing this headset up with my phone. I made a test call to my home and left a message on voicemail. Listened to the message, which sounded fine. The two issues I had with this unit: 1) During a call, what I was hearing in the earpiece seemed like it was cutting in and out...or maybe more like the volume was going up and down. It wasn't real bad to the point of me not being able to hear it at all or not understand, but it was somewhat annoying. 2) THE THING WON'T STAY IN MY EAR!!!!! I noticed that several people had mentioned this in their reviews, but I thought I'd give it a try anyway. It comes with small, medium, and large interchangeable covers for the earpiece. The small is installed when you take the unit out of the package, and the medium and large pieces were packaged separately in the box. I tried all three and none worked any better than the others. I also tried in my left ear, as I saw one reviewer mention that it stayed in when he used it in his left ear but not his right. The left ear didn't work any better. It stays in my right ear for a little while, and then just all of a sudden drops out. Couldn't get it to stay in my left ear at all. I have absolutely no clue what purpose the ""hook"" (that's what Samsung calls it) serves. That's the loop you see on top of the earpiece in the pictures. It doesn't hook onto anything. I guess it's somehow supposed to make the fit in your ear a little more snug, but did absolutely nothing for me.

"Pros: This is a handy little charger and works as advertised. It's sleek, and comes with a little bag, which is great to throw in your carry-on, purse or briefcase.

This will definitely be enough for any of my international flights and extended car trips. It also works great with my iphone. Cons: 1. The included instructions are not well-written, and I think that is the problem with some of the bad reviews -- they can't figure out how to use it. When you want to charge your iphone/ipad, you have to connect your apple cable into the female receptor of the little short black cable that then connects to the charger. If you plug the apple cable directly into the charger, then it doesn't charge. 2. Also, one weird thing -- while it was charging my ipad, the ipad gives a message saying ""not charging"". However, it actually did charge the whole time while it had that message.

Not a huge deal, but the sparks are concerning, and I don't know why the charger even needs that metal border in the first place. It seems aesthetic, and dangerous. I have since stopped storing the charger with a phone cord plugged into it, and only plug the cord in when I am ready to charge my phone. Otherwise, the product is great.

I haven't had a chance to test transfer speeds, but I can guess it will be like any other USB 2.0 hubs out there. This hub is extremely small, even compared to my original 4 port USB hub. I was surprised it used a mini USB port to USB to connect from the hub to the computer. The 7 port hub manual also states that it has 500 mA for EACH PORT. Which is enough to charge most USB devices. All my devices charged at a normal rate. Although, my Blackberry Tour was being charged a bit slow compared to a dedicated power adapter (but this was expected...). This isn't a problem for me because I wanted something to charge my devices over night. It cut down a lot of charging adapters for me. Also, I feel it's more green because I can have all 6 devices plugged in and if I'm not using it, I can just unplug the adapter for the USB hub cutting all the power to the devices.

"Like many others, having seen all the glowing user reviews on Amazon I decided to give this one a shot. I had never used a bluetooth headset before and had never owned one, but have generally had great experiences with other Amazon items that have been well-reviewed. I've had it now for about a month. Bottom line: it does what it's supposed to do, and does it well. Like another reviewer, I've had people tell me that I sound clearer on the headset than on the phone (a Motorola RAZR with Verizon service). I've never had problems with the connection to the phone. On comfort, it took me a while to realize that I had to just let it rest on the outside of my ear canal rather than try and make the earbud really fit in it. It feels a little loose, but never in danger of falling off. It also fits a lot better on my left ear than my right, and I never thought I had asymmetrical ears before, but so it goes. It just works, and there's something to be said for that. Consider this another wholehearted recommendation from someone else who saw the great reviews for this thing and took the plunge. *EDIT: I would take off a half a point if I could for that annoying blue light on the boom mic.",positive,neutral,0.048650007481857556,0.5179081457579198,0.43344184676022274

"I work in sales from my home so I'm on the phone quite a bit. I was using a GE cordless phone with a corded headset for a number of years and that worked well but, was limited.

The sound quality is good but, there is constant crackling and pops in the background, just loud enough to be distracting.

The software from Motorola to allow it to talk to my XP OS, particularly the driver must be hidden well or I am more computer illiterate than I thought.

"Pros: + Compact + Clear voice + Full of accessories in box + Comfortable fit Cons: - Voice control doesn't work well in noisy environment - very susceptible to wind noise - Battery capacity - Doesn't remember LED light setting after power cycle - Button does not do standard calling functions while in voice control mode. - Hogging speed dial spots. I bought the V1 to upgrade from Jabra BT8010 because BT8010 doesn't stay in my ear well. V1 fits very well with the ear gel. Sound quality is pretty good, as good as listening to the cellphone directly. I tried the included Comply foam (model T-200, comes with two pieces), the sound becomes too loud and bassy for my taste. (I ended up using the Comply foams on Shure e2c stereo headphones. Works great.) But my biggest gripe is about the voice control. While driving, 50% of the time it doesn't pick up what I say correctly. It also hardcodes the first few speed dials of your phone to commands like ""call home"". So if you had set your phone's speed dial 2 to work, you still have to say ""call home"" to call work. Also, all my other bluetooth headphones in the past allows you to press and hold the button to do redial, but not the V1 in the default voice control mode. It gets a little awkward when others can hear you dialing with the headset - all of a sudden they hear you say something like ""redial"". And to end a call, you have to double click instead of a single click (which controls the digital noise filter). The V1 is weak against wind noise. while walking in a light breeze, me and the person on the other ends of the phone were hearing a lot of noises. The two digital filter settings doesn't seem to matter much. My old BT8010 usually lasts 2~3 days before recharge, but I have to recharge V1 every other day. One last thing, the blue LED light flashes every now and then, which can get a little annoying in the dark. You can turn it off in the settings menu, but power cycling always resets it back on.",neutral,neutral,0.04596728136124353,0.8913018111685556,0.06273090747020095
"I bought the item, got it on a Friday, used it Saturday and it came apart. The main problem is the armband is way too small.

Because the strap is too small for me, I have to pull it a bit so the velcro catches.

Once the facing is loose, I was concerned about dropping my iPhone and bearing the expense of a new one. Belkin could do better if they added a couple inches to the strap.

It also has a very clean and nice appearance. No less than 3 other people who have seen my phone with this case has inquired about and purchased this case for their own use. Highly recommended for anyone who works outside or does any kind of heavy work or activity.,positive,positive,0.00043667142653185527,0.0005081255110309622,0.9990552030624372
"This BT headset works as advertised. The sound quality is very good with ample volume, although the bass is slightly weak. It readily connected with my Nokia phone. It is an earbud design that uses the same replaceable earbuds found in Sony's Fantopia line of stereo headsets. It is comfortable in the ear. You answer calls by pushing a button/mic on the wire to the left earpiece. Since I got mine last month I find myself using it frequently. can wear it for long time periods without discomfort. It's a pricey, but very good unit.",positive,neutral,0.04155821577938702,0.6699607689719127,0.2884810152487003
"I love the PDA, I love the internet access and email. Typing is easy using their suretype concept. Two warnings -- Blackberry and Gmail don't always work together (blackberry says they can't fix it - it's cause Gmail is beta). Also, big issue is that the microphone quality on the phone is real below average -- I've had many many people complain that they cannot understand my words (moving mouth back kinda helps). Use of 2 different headsets and two different phones does not really fix this. Sum is I find I use the whole phone less, which is ultimately a hassle. Tmobile support says I'm not the only one who's noted this problem. I wish I could give them the extra $5 it probably costs RIM to put a average quality mic in the unit, but alas.....",neutral,neutral,0.2426647313025127,0.6680135809803707,0.08932168771711675
"I am very pleased with the funtionality of the phone - 1) The Phonebook is great with the multiple phone numbers per person (H, M, W). 2) Very easy to switch between speaker, handset or headset. 3) I like how the call log shows ALL calls or can be filtered down to 'missed', 'dialed' and 'answered'. Two drawbacks so far - 1) The pain in & around my ear from the earpiece and earloop ***very uncomfortable if you have petite ears*** For someone used to Jabra's gel earpieces this is a huge let down. Hopefully I will toughen up as the funtionality makes the phone a keeper, in spite of the pain. 2) The ringtones leave much to be desired - I can only tolorate the default one.",positive,positive,0.031780109730496116,0.09360020819184041,0.8746196820776635

"I just received this battery today, so not much else i can say other than it is pretty much exactly as it was described. The one thing i can say i'm quite pleased and relieved about is that the battery door that shipped seems to be solidly held in place. Unlike the other people who reviewed this item, my battery door does not fall off, nor does it seem it would fall off even if i dropped the phone. Maybe the seller saw these reviews and improved the doors since, but mine is flawless. My only initial dissapointment is that the battery does add significant weight and size to the phone. Since i just received it today, i haven't really had much experience in taking the phone places to see if it's going to be that much more of an inconvinience, so that remains to see, but i'm optimistic.

"The base technology as deployed in the original Jawbone is the best noise canceling system on any headset. However the system requires a sensor on the headset be in contact with you face (just above your jawbone). Some people felt the original was too big and heavy and so this model is much smaller and lighter. However while re-engineering the unit reduced size / weight, it now has a major problem with fit. It's uncomfortable to wear for extended periods, is easily dropped and critically the reduced mass means it flops around and loses the face contact required to make the core technology work. Very disappointing product.

"In general, it performs as it claims... The only qualms i have with the software is that i don't seems to be able to drag and move the map around the screen... I am not sure whether i didn't read the manual fully or this is a feature of the software... When i was using another version of GPS software, it actually allows me to drag and move the map around. I find this feature very useful especially when the GPS signal is lost and i try to use it as a normal map. I hope that in the future, Garmin can change it to a 4GB or larger memory card. 2Gb nowadays is very small... Also, if cost permits, Garmin can throw in a quick guide booklet into package. It is good of them to assume that people who buy such products are GPS savvy but the learning curve in terms of using the software would be much more gentle with such material available. Before you go and buy this, do check with Garmin whether it supports your PDA phone. You can email them and they usually reply in a few days time.

"This mobile phone replaced a Nokia 6270 I bought approximately 6 months ago (I have reviewed that phone on Amazon also - please read the review if you are considering purchasing that phone). Here are the highlights of the 3125: Pros: (1) Design is excellent - The phone is thin enough to easily fit in pants pockets without being obtrusive or feeling heavy. Buttons located on the exterior of the unit require sufficient force so that they aren't accidentally activated while handling the phone. While the exterior is low profile and slim, it is also textured with small ridges in strategic touchpoints (sides, back battery plate, etc) that enhance your grip. Nice touch. (2) Screen - Very clear; graphics quality is excellent. I have not used the browser function yet, but it appears the screen resolution would provide a decent experience. (3) Keypad - Well designed despite the lack of independent buttons. I'll have to admit, the 'sheet metal' implementation of buttons on the RAZR is what turned me off. It felt like buttons would be accidentally pressed and the design would not wear well, but the Cingular 3125 seems to have struck the right balance. Keys are easy to use and have good feedback. (4) Menu system - Straightforward for a Windows-based phone with such a variety of features. It is never easy to pack that many features onto a menu structure that fits intuitively on the screen of a cell phone, but they've done a respectable job of it. My biggest hurdle was pairing a Jabra headset; I didn't get that a 'menu' function on the bottom of that feature would reveal Bluetooth pairing options, but it added a whole layer of new functionality. Seemed a bit unituitive, but maybe I was just didn't get the paradigm in my first couple tries. (5) Reception - Comparable to other Cingular phones I've used; seems to be effected by the same weak spots. (6) Battery life - A pleasant surprise! I talk a lot on my cell and two hours of calls had little effect on the battery (down by 1 bar). My Nokia would have been nearly drained. (7) Contact synchronization - I use a Mac, so this is more involved than it would have been if you are a Windows user. Still, I downloaded a synchronization package from the internet (The Missing Sync) and it worked very nicely. Contacts and appointments worked very well. (8) Headset - I bought a Jabra BT headset to work with this unit; it worked very well. The only issue is that the headset begins to experiencing skipping and choppiness if the phone and headset are out of line of site. For example, if the phone is in your pocket. (9) Responsiveness - I've owned PDAs and Smartphones before and I was always displeased with responsiveness of the interface. This appears to respond well. It lagged a few times, but it is tolerable. Cons: (1) Needs more themes out of the box. I don't use MSN, though that is the most attactive theme that comes with the phone. The Cingular theme is functional and looks decent, but you could reasonably expect something a little flashier considering that they got everything else right with this phone. (2) This is reaching a bit, but it comes with a 128MB SD chip. Considering the multi-media functionality, this is grossly insufficient. I'm a bit of a purist, prefering a separate, higher quality camera rather than one integrated with my phone, but I realize an integrated camera+phone is attractive to a lot of people. Between photos and music, you'll eat up 128MB before you know what's happened. (3) Ring volume is a bit low. Out-of-the-box, the ring volume is a bit difficult to hear if you are in even a moderately noisy environment. I have not yet found a way to increase ring volume. (4) Difficult to see missed call indicator on external display. The dark external display with the blue clock is undoubtedly a cool feature of this phone, but as soon as the backlight times out, you have to activate the light to see a missed call. Not a big deal, but a bit annoying if you are used glancing at an external display to identify missed calls. Definitely not a show stopper. Notable: (1) As I pointed out, I use Macs, not Windows, so Windows Media is useless for me. If you manage your songs and photos in Windows, I suspect the built-in Windows Media functionality would be a big plus for you. (2) Outlook integration looks very nice. This phone is going to be great if you use Outlook and your e-mail is hosted on Exchange. I'm a bit jealous. Why not 5 stars? If it interfaced with a Mac out of the box, I would recommend it without hesitation.

"The latest flip phone by Nokia is what you call a basic phone with added features at a reasonably low price. It has been 1 month since i have owned it and i did come across a few issues which are 1) the battery status bar is not accurate. I took the liberty of not charging my phone for about 4 days looking at the bar which showed about 75% ,and on the 5th day it went dead. But thankfully it came alive after i charged it overnight. So i guess it has to be charged daily. 2) It supports MP3 ringtones but it has about 4 MB of memory. 4mb? it is too minimal for a phone to support media and mp3.3 pics and 2 ringtones ...and the memory is full. I had to get rid of most of the nokia logos and ringtones to accomodate my personal stuff. Anyway the phone is pretty okie but it would do better with a memory card slot. Considering the number of free and reasonably good phones available this is a so-so deal. At least it was better than my earlier phone the siemens flip phone. So i guess 4 **** is the rating i would like to give it.",positive,neutral,0.1314230455550311,0.6883979719963506,0.18017898244861846

"I read a lot of reviews on the product and then purchased this recently. I have to say it is excellent. Much better than the Polycom or Jabra products. A couple of nice features: 1) Multiple phone connect 2) Auto connect to phone (this works almost too well. When my car is in the garage in my house, this sometimes gets picked up). 3) Extremely clear speaker 4) Phonebook announcement for callers So, it's nice to have the announcement when I'm driving. If the person is in your address book and you uploaded it to the SuperAnt, it will say ""Joe Smith calling..."" The speaker is also loud enough to use for conference calls on its own. I compared this with the $500 Polycom conferencing speakerphone, which did not sound as loud nor did it sound as clear on the other end for the listeners. Also, this uses a magnetic clip which is cool - I can disconnect easily to put in my laptop bag if needed. The battery lasts an astonishingly long time. I think I charge it once a month.

"Hello People. Here is an honest review for those who are looking for a good headset. I purchased the Voyager 510 over two years ago to go with my Katana phone. The problem I was having with the 510 was that the signal would drop a lot, so much that I called Plantronic and they told me that the Katana was not compatible with the 510. However, they're customer service was excellent. They told me that cell phones control headset, headsets don't control phones. Cell phones send out signals and headsets pick up the signal. But to make sure I didn't have a defected headset, they sent me a new 510 hoping that will solve the problem. However it didn't. So I was convinced that it was the headset, not my Katana. My wife and I decided to upgrade our phones, so I purchased the Samsung Instinct and I wanted a Bluetooth headset that would work with my new phone, since I was convinced that the 510 was not a good headset. So I purchased the Plantronic Discovery 925. I really was excited when I received the 925. However, here are my Pros and Cons of the 925: Pros: 1. It looked great and its small size was great compared to my 510. 2. The recharging case was a neat feature. 3. One button controlled everything. Cons: 1. It was the most uncomfortable headset I ever wore; so much that it hurt my ear. 2. The sound was not very loud compared to my 510. 3. The recharging case was very difficult to place the headset in. Summary: I returned the 925. It just caused too much pain to my ear. In the meantime I continued to use my 510, which I notice was working pretty well, no drop calls with my new Instinct. Still not too sure about the 510, I purchased the Jawbone. Once again, I was really excited when I received the Jawbone. However, here are my Pros and Cons of the Jawbone: Pros: 1. It looked great and its small size was great compared to my 510. Cons: 1. It wasn't comfortable to wear. 2. The sound wasn't very loud. 3. The buttons are hard to find and the fit was very hard to achieve. Summary: I read several reviews and a lot of people recommended getting Jabra mini eargels and it would fit perfect. So I order the eargels. However, I said to myself, ""why should I pay an extra $10 to get a headset to work correctly. I already spent $90 on the headset. The eargels should have come with the headset."" So after I gave it some though, I returned the Jawbone. I wasn't impressed with the Jawbone at all. My 510 worked better than the Jawbone. At this point, I started to believe that it wasn't my 510 at all; it was the Katana, just like Plantronic customer service said, because my 510 is working great. However, since my 510 is over 2 years old, I'll try one last headset and use the 510 as a backup headset. So I purchased the Voyager 520, which was supposed to be an upgrade to the 510. However, here are my Pros and Cons of the 520: Pro: 1. The 520 is the most comfortable headset I ever wore. 2. One button controls everything Cons: 1. You must keep the headset close to the phone. It says you can go 33 feet away from your phone using this headset, but that's not true. It's more like 9 feet and I'm being generous with the 9 feet. With my 510, I can go a long distance and the signal is still strong. 2. Not very loud compared to my 510. 3. There is a lot of static compare to my 510. Summary: Needless to say, I was very disappointed with the 520 and returned it. Conclusion: I must say out of all these headsets, my Plantronic Voyager 510 worked best and out performed all of these for my needs. I'm not saying the rest of these headset are not good headsets. However, for my needs, none of these headset are better than my 510. The 510 has to be one of the best headsets ever made and I would recommend it to anyone. Just make sure your phone is compatible with it. And yes, the 925, Jawbone and 520 all are compatible with my phone, but the 510 still out perform them all.",negative,neutral,0.10266179945287977,0.8143612654056157,0.08297693514150442
"I have been using this unit for the past 6 months. I am currently using another brand (Jabra cruiser2) Here is what I have found regarding the Motorola unit. Pros: Easy to use, pairs easily and I never had any problem with it recognizing my phone when turning on the unit. Sound quality through the unit and through the radio was very good. I have not had any issues with voice recognition like other reviewers. I do like the ""preset"" FM frequencies to a point (more below)People I have called said they can hear me clearly and I have not had any complaints. I use this unit everyday, I have a 40 minute commute each way 2 days a week and a 1 hr commute one day a week and usually on the road for 2-3 hours one day a week. I find that it will keep a charge the whole week. Streaming music from my phone through the unit to the radio is excellent. With a clean channel, the sound is very good. Cons: After 6 months the charging socket broke. Since I travel a fair distance and through a couple of cities, the preset FM frequencies sometimes are frustrating. It will seem to pick the same ""random"" frequencies, but they are not clean channels. You have no ability to specifically choose a frequency that you want. So you end up hitting the button repeatedly trying to find a frequency and sometimes the unit will cycle back to the same frequencies over and over. I know that you can save presets, but that doesn't always seem to help.",neutral,negative,0.5126473937399818,0.39760461757108373,0.08974798868893447
The headset works wonderfully. I just turned it on and found it on my phone and now everytime i turn it on it auto connects. I can start music and make calls all with the headset. Something that i found to be interesting is that when in calls the sound comes through both earbuds. The only thing that i don't like about it is that it has a delay when i hook it up to my laptop but that isn't a problem because listening to music who cares and i didn't get it for my laptop. Also it might be the settings on my laptop making it lag like it does. I would recommend this headset to anyone and if you don't need stereo then u should atleast get the 815 mono version of this headset. Allot of people were complaing about the buttons being hard to push or the slide part being hard but i have no problem with it. I will agree that if i push the call button on it it does go into my ear canal but i learned and now i just hold the side with my thumb and middle finger so it doesnt. Another thing that people were complaing about was the sound volume but mine gets plenty loud i mean if you were listening to it in a very loud enviorment then you could hear that a little over the music but i used it at a party and i could hear just fine so i think that it gets loud enough. The range on it is awesome because i can leave my phone in my room upstairs and go anywhere in my house and it will still work.,positive,positive,0.052396300268238105,0.08054237234788923,0.8670613273838726

"This product does not live up to it's marketing. Although inbound audio quality is good, outbound audio is inferior to much cheaper non-noise canceling products. The outbound audio is tinny and sometimes distorted. The earpieces designed to rest in the ear canal have been designed with too much tolerance in their interface with the base unit so when you twist them on, they easily fall off. This makes putting the device on your ear an extreme challenge. I finally had to use a small amount of adhesive to bond the earpiece to the device so it would not fall off every time I put in on my ear.

Sure the phone looks cool but the V3xx razor blows this thing away specification wise. Why the Goforce 4800GPU was not included in this phone is beyond me.

Also, when the side of my head with the Jabra on it was facing the phone, I got better reception than when I turned away. I am, apparently, thick headed. Using the Jabra in the car was an awesome experience, since the phone was so close to me. There were no wires to interfere with my driving, and I could answer calls easily with the Jabra itself, never even touching the phone. But $80 is too much to pay for wireless convenience in a car. Until the technology improves or price drops, the Jabra is just not as vaulable as a simple wired handsfree device. I returned my Jabra after one week.",negative,neutral,0.4505209590265895,0.5006528986774931,0.048826142295917425
"I've been a Treo user since the Treo 90 and have owned all the Treos except the 700. Recently (yesterday) I switched to T-Mobile having acquired a BlackBerry 8100 Pearl from Amazon and I am completely satisfied. I switched carriers because my Sprint service in Tucson was poor at best & even-though they would fix it after spending 45 minutes on the phone (conservative estimate); the fix only lasted a week or two & then back to constantly dropped calls. This is a much better phone than any of the Treos I owned. I won't bore you with a lot of subjective jabber, instead I will list it's strengths: *Small & Light *Great bluetooth range and performance *State of the art voice commands (including dialing) *Easy to use and setup - never cracked the manual *T-Mobile representatives/support/service are great - fairly fast internet - well thought out design & interface... I'm a veteran Mac user & I was able to transfer all my Entourage data (calendar, notes, ToDos, addresses:) without a hitch using the software included on the CD - syncing is a snap! After the transfer I paired the Pearl with my SamSung Wep200 and was immediately able to voice dial using my imported addresses - amazing. I'm off to MacWorld Expo tomorrow but no iPhone for me! I'm completely satisfied with this phone & I'll let Apple debug the iPhone before I get one. Improvements?

"Pros - excellent display and menu, user friendly shortcuts, good battery life(see comments below), good speakerphone. Cons - average call quality, cheap cover. Overall - a very good phone. I don't use my phone as a camera or music player so I can not comment on that. Battery - Several people have indicated problems with the battery in their reviews. The battery for this phone is the same as Nokia 6102. I previously had a Nokia 6102 and its battery lasted 4-5 days with moderate usage. When I got 6133, its battery drained out in 2 days. However when I enabled all the ""Power Saver"" options (settings => main/mini display, turn off screen saver, turn off keypad, start-up and switch off tones etc.) in 6133, the battery started lasting around 4-5 days with moderate usage.

I got this phone becuase it was free with an upgrade. I had read reviews and thought it would be worth the money (none) to upgrade to it. It's a good phone. I've had it two days and the battery is still going strong... they say it takes a few rechargings to get the full potential out of the battery. On the plus side: I like the front screen that shows caller ID. It makes for a quick check to see if I want to answer or not. I also like the calendar. I can pull it up and quickly look at appointments. I haven't bought the data cable yet but plan to do so soon. I like the navigation disc... it's easy to get around in menus although the menus themselves are sometimes tricky... the cancel/exit/ok buttons switch sides on some menus. The Shortcut option is great... the menu on this thing is extensive so it's nice to be able to quickly get to often-used menu options. My biggest pet peeve people who let their phones go off in public places where they have no business answering a phone... so I love the vibrate option built into this phone. Speakerphone!! On the downside: I'm left-handed and the side buttons really are a pain. I can't hold the phone with my left hand for long. It'd be great to be able to disable the side buttons... or change their functions. The phone becomes very uncomfortable on my ear after awhile. I don't understand the need for the side button that allows for voice-calling since I must have the phone open to use that functionality anyhow. It's just in the way. The camera is pretty sad... I never understood the need for a camera on a phone in the first place and 640x480 is basically useless. Often times I've been entering contacts and I accidentally hit the hang-up button instead of the save button and PRESTO... I lose all my entered info! I want to be able to put my name on the front screen since my wife and I have identical phones... can't do it. Can't do it on the inside screen either (It'd be nice to take off my service provider's name too).

"Originally using the Wii on a 720p rear projection Panasonic for viewing Netflix offerings, I was using was the standard RCA cable.

The minimal improvement may be due to the type of TV I am using.

The only part that underperformed was the microphone. The other person could hear me fine when in quite areas. The microphone would pick up everything to a certain degree. A feature that I loved, but many may not need, is the ability to listen to music. The only downside to this is that sometimes the songs would skip if you held the phone to far away from the headset, which is about the length of my arm (sorry don't know how long that is).

"Pros: It's beautiful. It's compact. It's sturdy. It works well as a phone. Reception is good. Voice-dialing works great. I can check my gmail at a click of a button. I can look up my google calendar the same way. (After simple programming) MP3 player works well. The sounds are great. I like multimedia aspect of the phone, too. ""Flipping"" can be annoying, but considering that it is not a PDA phone but works just as well, it is a minor inconvenience that one can easily put up with. Takes decent pictures. If you are a thoughtful photographer, you can end up with some frame-able shots. Video quality is not all that great, but I like it that it automatically creates a quick time file that I can easily send to both Mac and PC users and they have no problem downloading and viewing them. After all, no one really intends on shooting an award winning film with phone camcorder, right? Cons: MP3 Player song list is not as intuitive as iPod. If you have 500 songs and the song you want to listen to is song number 400, you have to go from the top all the way to 400. Get the picture? Flipping can be annoying, but as mentioned above, you can get used to it. There is a big learning curve on understanding all the functions and characteristics of the phone. You start out excited, because the phone is beautiful and seems promising. Then you get frustrated very fast by the ""sensitivity"" of the multimedia buttons and the constant flipping. And then you fall in love with it all over again as you get used to the phone, because it has a lot to offer. Love hate. Comes only with 64meg memory. Good thing is that you can expand it by getting a 1 gig or even 2 gig memory card. I have 2 gigs and I love it. The extended battery is good to have, but sometimes it's cumbersome to carry your phone in it. It's a beautiful phone, wouldn't you want to show it off? But the extended battery does come handy at times, so it's like, you want it and then you don't want it. You debate where to put the extended battery if you take your phone off it. Bottom line: I wanted to return this phone many times. It's been 3 weeks. I am still debating. It has a lot of good things to offer, but it also has its quirks and problems. If you want something that comes close to a PDA without the bulk, if you want something like an iPhone, but not yet ready to buy an iPhone like me, this is a good one to get. I most likely will keep it, but I know that it will be a constant love/hate thing.

"This is a very nice, high tech phone. I really like the mp3 player/cell phone combo. I get very good reception with the phone and its pretty easy to use. A few dislikes... in order to use all of the functions on the phone you have to purchase expensive ""optional"" accessories (Blue Tooth, Music Essentials Kit). also, the touch sensors on the phone seem to have a mind of thier own. I often end up dialing people on accident. The END CALL button is not easy to touch...its on the right hand side. Your other option is to slide the phone closed. There is no SpeakerPhone (other than listening to your song playlist. This is a more difficult phone to hook your charger, headset, usb calbes to. I wish it had a regular round plug, but this is the flat type that has to be lined up just right or you risk damaging something. Im a little disappointed in some aspects of the phone, but I really do like the MP3 feature. VCast isn't available yet where i live, so Im not sure how good that is. with an upgrade at Verizon your gonna pay $220 for the phone delivered (and you will get a $50 mail in rebate). Then you will need to get your bluetooth, case, car charger, music essentials kit, and the micro SD card (i suggest a 1G). Your looking at $150 for those ""extras"".

"I bought the iPAQ h6315 about 2 weeks ago. I mainly wanted something that I could use as my everyday cellphone, a decent handheld for contact/note keeping, something to pass the time surfing the internet, and something that I could use a bluetooth headset with. I had several problems immediately. The first is that the Jabra headset would not connect. I was told it was incompatible by the HP company, and was given a list of other headsets that were compatible -- two headsets later, still could not get it to work. Apparently it's a pretty common problem from what I've read online. It also froze fairly often, requiring ~ 4 soft resets a day. Although theoretically you are not supposed to lose any info on soft resets, I lost my contact list several times. I had problems with phone reception in the middle of downtown Washington, D.C. Friends who also had TMobile had good reception standing right next to me, leading me to believe the reception was a problem with the machine itself, rather than TMobile. On the good side, the WiFi worked well, and the handheld (other than freezing up) in general worked well. The screen had a nice resolution, and was a nice size. Pros: - Nice WiFi - Decent handheld applications Cons: - Frequent soft resets needed, occ lost info. - Bluetooth would not work with multiple different headsets - Poor reception in area that had good TMobile signals for others. - A little big, especially with the keyboard attached. I returned it. I spent too much time working with the thing, and was getting mediocre to poor results.

"This is one of those devices that you don't know you need until you have it. Between using our phones for personal and business, and also having our kids play games, we find that we can't make it through the day without charging our phone. And since we're always on the go, the iTorch has been the perfect accessory for keeping our devices charged and ready to go. Usually when we take long trips with our friends and family, someone is always asking for a wall charger and then they have to find an outlet to use. Now we can just keep this in our bag and plug our phone in and keep going. It does come with a red laser pointer and flashlight, which are cool features. I haven't used the laser pointer for anything practical yet, but the flash light has been useful more than I had expected. This is also a very small and slick looking device. It has caught the attention of many passer byers and it's very easy to tote around. This does not come with a wall charger though, just 2 USB cables and a carry bag.

"I bought the BlueAnt ST3 months ago...Most people don't like to talk to me while I am on this device because they say it sounds really bad going out...Sucks too because it costs around $90-100. Anyway, I must say the voice quality coming in is pretty good, although as in some other reviews, sometimes the volume goes really loud, then really soft for no reason. There is some good potential with this device, just needed a little more time in development IMO. I read reviews before getting this, which at the time were only about 10 reviews. I probably would not get it again: Pros: -Functionally it CAN upload your phones phone book (only certain models -not listed). -Voice quality coming in is decent -Wireless. -Voice command dialing. Cons: -Bad other-end voice quality from what EVERYONE is teling me -Does not upload every phones phonebook...I am willing to bet that the list for UNSUPPORTED Phones w/ bluetooth is far higher than SUPPORTED phones to transfer the phonebook -Volume goes up and down sometimes for no reason. -Sometimes the voice answer doesn't work (even though this is normally a great feature) -It does read out the number (or name if stupid phonebook functionality worked) of the caller -Buttons can get confusing (even though there are only two it's another one of those, hold button for 5 seconds for this, 3 seconds for that, 1 second to call, 10 seconds to turn off, whatever...great there are only two buttons, but it's still difficult to remember how to do everything) Ok - so overall, I would not recommend getting this bluetooth device, unless you have first called someone who has it and have a listen for yourself..If you catch yourself saying ""I didn't get that"" or ""say that one more time"" or ""this device is junk"" more than 2 times, then it's garbage. HAHA...ok, this is way too harsh of a review...but I am just telling it how it is...I have heard good things about the cheaper BlueAnt light...for half the price - get that if you can live w/out the ""extra features""...I bought this cause I am a techy nerd, but it just doesn't support all the functions it CLAIMS and I have had on numerous occasions bad experiences talking using this device...AThankYouVeryMuch",neutral,neutral,0.11786434501239196,0.8799092257539027,0.0022264292337052065

"While the Pearl shows potential, I am planning to return mine to AT&T within my 30-day evaluation period. This little BlackBerry shows a lot of promise but comes up short as being a reliable phone. This is my first BlackBerry, and even with its marvelous email functionality (bundled with AT&T's $29.99 data plan), I find this device cheaply built and finicky to use. The durability of this unit leaves a lot to be desired. Like some of the cheapest phones on the market this unit features weak flimsy plastic casing. The unit feels like a toy in your hand, especially when removing the battery cover. An optional MicroSD card goes in this area so the battery compartment will need to be accessed over time. Basic phone use is a problem. Battery life is nothing exciting. Like many other phones, the ring volume and call volume just isn't very loud, even at maximum. In noisy areas it becomes hard to have a normal phone call. The ringtone will not play simultaneously while the unit vibrates, so calls are often missed. Historically this has plagued all BlackBerry's. The ""Vibrate+Tone"" mode causes 1-3 vibrations before the ringtone begins. RIM has stated this may be fixed in upcoming units. Answering a call becomes even more difficult using AT&T's OEM leather case. The phone must be pulled out of the case before it can be used; the case has no holes for access while sheathed, or leaving the included headphone plugged in. Safely answering a call in a hands-free manner is near impossible and should not be performed with this phone especially if driving a car. One of the features I was most excited about was the browser. While it offers some basic functionality, it is unable to utilize 90% of what's on the web. Most web sites will not function in this Java based browser, which does not begin to touch what might be accomplished on a device such as an iPhone. Graphics, sounds, music, animation, and Flash all don't work on the Pearl. You can do things like get directions and perform basic Google searches, which remains very useful, but forget any ""fun"". If you can live with the cheap plastic build quality and are in need of email functionality in a small package you might want to consider this phone. Personally I cannot live with a device that is built like a toy and misses so many calls due to simple things like speakers that aren't loud enough and ringtones that cannot happen while the phone vibrates.",negative,neutral,0.42572245117259333,0.4659022591104459,0.10837528971696075

"As an previous owner of the original RAZR V3 from about 6-7 years ago, I thought I would give the phone another try despite the negative reviews I read.

"I'm using this charging caddy for my 2 phones (Samsung Galaxy S4 and iPhone 6s), MP3 player, keys, and wallet. To go along with this caddy, I purchased a USB charging hub that hides in the base of this charging caddy, and also a switch for the AC outlet, so it is only drawing power and charging at night when I need to charge the phones. Overall, I like the caddy and it works fine for keeping things organized and concealing all the cords. However, I think the width of the phone dividers needs to be updated to fit more currents phones. Many smartphones in 2016 now have 5.0"" screens, or larger. As you can see in the picture, the iPhone 6 (4.7"" screen) with a case barely fits in the end divider.

We have had the Virgin service for many years. They are the lowest cost of all the prepays as far as I can tell. In our area it the service is actually supplied by Sprint and coverage leaves a lot to be desired. Last year I bought the Flare for my wife. I have a similar model with Verizen but mine has no Bluetooth. I was exited to see the Flare had Bluetooth when we bought our new Kia Sorento with that feature built in. The only problem is the Flare will interface and call out but you can't answer a call with the Bluetooth. Kia has demonstrated this problem is with the phone and not the car. I also found another complaint of the same nature with a different vehicle. I contacted LG about the problem and they said sorry we were having trouble but they had no plans for an update or fix. In all the Virgin service is a decent value and the LG Flare has been reliable.,neutral,neutral,0.06093123751346548,0.8808077036435009,0.058261058843033536

"I'm glad I waited awhile to write this review, because when I first got this phone, I loved it (I should note that I'm already on my second one as the first one stopped working, and was covered under warranty). The music player is fun, and the camera takes good pictures (the flash is a helpful feature). But, as time goes on, this phone really wears out - and fast. The power/end call button stopped working altogether on my first one, and the select (circle) button fell off. The power button was a warranty issue, so I had to pay $10 (S&H) and got a new phone. Well, six months into the second one, I had the same issue w/ the select button. This is a well known defect with this phone, as I learned when I went into the T-Mobile store, but it is not covered under warranty. Then, about 3 months after that, the entire larger circle that contains the up/down/left/right arrows fell off.

"A few weeks into using this product and I'm having some odd issues. 1 - the battery life is not quite as suggested 2 - I have to keep my head unnaturally still during a call to keep any clarity on phone calls 3 - there is a noticeable lag to audio on this device (just over 1 second), which makes it challenging to use audio on language-learning apps, snapchat and other kinds of communication apps. I don't know if that's inherent to all types of stereo bluetooth headsets or just this one. 4 - while exercising, the device will often change the EQ on its own. 5 - sometimes it will not respond to button presses, especially the play/pause button. 6 - I'm not sure why, but the device will sometimes not respond even if the battery is not yet dead. Despite all this, I enjoy how lightweight the unit is and the simplicity of its design. Even though the device sits snugly on my neck, I have forgotten I'm wearing it more than once. I was worried I would have broken it or messed up the cables by now, but so far, it's held up to some less-than-genius ideas in my sometimes absent-minded student/amateur athlete/shameless prototyper lifestyle. The magnet feature for the headphones is fantastic and I am really rather impressed with the audio quality. Occasionally I have trouble keeping the buds in my ears when exercising but have learned that's mostly because I may have pulled one out to do something or talk to someone and sweat got between the plug and my ear.

Let me start with this is the 4th one of these I have had over the past 4 years. Life span seems to be about a year. I know they leak where they mount to the existing shower pipe and this can be solved by adding two rubber washers to make up the distance to the threads. This solved the leak. What surprised me was this was completely dis-assembled. The head was not attached to the arm and the arm was not attached to the mount. The pieces were loose in the box. This is an upgrade to the old style so I used the old one as a guide and assembled the new one. It works but there is no way to tighten the tension down where it can't be moved and the parts are not interchangeable. I did notice that if it gets where it will not stay in position there is no way to re-tighten. If this happens I will open it up and RTV it permanently in place where I like it. The only reason I replaced the old one is the rubber tips were splitting and no longer spraying a single straight stream. 3 stars because it is to much trouble to assemble.,neutral,neutral,0.35080626439940976,0.4735371004144106,0.1756566351861797

"I purchased this headset with high expectations. I took my time. I compared and contrasted. I read all the reviews. I thought I had made a great purchase. Unfortunately, the ergonomic design of this headset does not match the electronic design. I can't believe how badly Aliph missed the mark with this headset! First, the good. The sound from this headset rocks! The noise mitigating technology is great. I work in computer data centers the noise level often fluctuates. The set adjusts both the sound heard by the other listener and the volume that I hear. It still has very poor quality in windy environments, but I don't know of a set that doesn't. Now the bad. This headset wouldn't be allowed in Guantanamo Bay. It is pure torture to wear. The various combinations of ear bud and ear loop just gives you more ways to inflict pain on your ears. I can't wear the headset for more than about 10-15 minutes, and sometimes end calls due to the uncomfortable feeling. I used to put the set in my pocket between calls. Problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily. I contacted the company and they indicates that this is because if the loop doesn't break, the headset itself would break instead. The company told me I could ""gently"" bend the loops to fit my ear better. They also recommended Jabra ear gels instead of the Aliph ear buds. They also recommended a place that can make a custom gel earbud (for about $65 + shipping). I asked them if it felt right to them that I paid $130 (Best Buy) for their headset and then have to bend the pieces that come with it and buy a competitor's ear gel just to make it comfortable. They didn't seem to have a problem with it. I finally got around the earloop pain by bending a paper clip around my ear and using that for a loop. I do intend to buy a different ear gel bud because Aliph's just hurts my ear. Also interesting that when I told them I had relieved the loop problem with a custom bent paper clip, they never asked to see it. They don't seem interested in improving the feel of this product on the ear. All said, I would never buy this product again and cannot recommend it for use.

"We recently purchased two of these in retail packaging. The headset is small, light (plastic) and attractive. The buttons are ""concealed"" behind the outer plastic shell of the headset. While this makes for a more attractive appearance, it is difficult to locate the buttons and the response to pressing the buttons is less than clear. On one of the units the button at the back of the headset (used for pairing) did not work at all through the shell. In order to press the button I had to completely pull off the plastic shell. This is not something that I would want to do regularly. As to audio quality, they seem to work as expected. The headset is light and remains in my ear when using the ear loop.

"I upgraded to this Nokia 6102 phone after my other Nokia fell in a toilet on accident (which is a little intact but kept dying on me randomly). I always hated flip phones because they are easy to break and snap in half if you accidentally drop it with the lid popped up. I used to have a Samsung flip phone and after time the lid become lose and eventually broke. This Nokia phone, however, has only been with me for a month and the antenna black piece popped off. It looks like it was held on my glue (NO SCREWS!!). The quality of it is not as good as I thought it would be. When I flip open the phone the joints that open the phone seem lose and it has only been a month. Also, the basic speaker is not great--I have a hard time hearing someone in the car or when there's a little noise around. The speakerphone is actually more powerful than the normal speaker! I am definitely going back to a Nokia 3595...This is a great basic phone and you don't have to worry about it breaking! Cingular has offered to replace it and send me a new Nokia 6102, but I refuse to own another. To summarize everything: PROS: -Camera (don't care for one since I have a new camera that takes better quality pics than cameraphones) -Speakerphone (loud and clear, more convienent when driving! -easy to read screen -double-screened -good battery life -Easy to handle (not too small, not to bulky) -Radio (can't use unless I buy headphones though) -Video (never really use it, don't care to have it) -Voice recording (you can make your own ring tones from it if you want) CONS: -Volume level is too LOW on the basic speaker -Not enough default themes/backgrounds to choose from.

"When I used my ""New Every 2"" upgrade to get the new enV2, I was really excited at the form factor, the new features such as the GPS, and expanded V-Cast catalog. After 2 months, my phone stopped charging consistently, and for awhile I made the best of it. However, trying to hold the car charger into the power port while driving became not just frustrating, but dangerous. The shop class project at home to make use of the wall charger so I didn't have to stand and hold it was also a lesson in safety while using power tools. I took the phone back to my local Verizon store, was informed I had a bad USB power port, and was blessed to know that the TEC insurance I've been paying for all these months was a solid investment. I was given the same model as a replacement, and left the store. Within 24 hours, I had 12 calls, of which 6 dropped inexplicably, even with 4 bars of signal sitting in a parked car next to a cell tower. 11 days later, I returned to my local Verizon store, only to stand at Tech Support for over an hour and a half and have them call the 1-800 number for help. They allowed that my call record showed an inordinately high drop rate, and that it ""might"" be my phone. Per the manager, this left me with one option and one only - take a new model of the same phone. I no sooner got the ""new"" phone into the car, which by the way was uncharged, and this one has a marginally working USB power port too, which I suspect will die in a few weeks as well. I'm confident between the lack of support I received at the Verizon store combined with the poor quality of the phone, I'll be an AT&T customer in another week.

"Hmmm? What can I say about the phone that everyone seems to want? The Motorola PEBL phone itself, is indubitably eye-catching. It offers exceptional operation & premium features. The PEBL is one of the most charming phones. Shaped like a river stone, it's attired in basic black & is nicely accessorized by a shiny metal hinge. I especially liked the oval shape, the rounded edges, and the rubbery textured feel of the casing is pretty nifty. It's very compact (3.4"" x 1.9"" x 0.8""; 3.8 ounces), and it has weight when it's in your hand. As for features... The phone book holds 1,000 contacts, each of which can take six phone numbers, an e-mail address, a postal address, and a birth date. I like that you can place photos with contacts for caller ID that are viewed on the internal screen. Contacts can be assigned one of 12 polyphonic or MP3's. I also appreciate the camera, vibrate mode, a one-minute voice recorder, voice dialing, calculator, calendar, alarm clock, text & multimedia messaging, PC syncing (my favorite!!), instant messaging ( with Yahoo, AOL, and/or ICQ), and a Web browser. You can personalize the PEBL with a variety of wallpapers, themes, menu styles, color skins, screensavers, and message tones. You can always download more depending on your service provider. Ok, now the bad. The PEBL has a low-resolution camera (whaaa), and a strange magnetic flip that is awkward to open with your thumb. The flip opens when dropped and can demagnetize credit cards. Would I buy the PEBL again? Yes. Would I recommend it to others? Sure. Who couldn't say 'yes' to such a looker?!!?!",positive,positive,0.0060720732755691585,0.07187721176757067,0.9220507149568602

"I recently recieved my Wilson signal booster amp and antenna. No problems installing, but was suprised at the outside antenna(Wondering if it will hold up). Installation took about 2 hrs. (As I mounted it on my roof 15-20 feet up). I anxiously made all of the connections. Before I activated the amp, I took a reading of my signal strength from my 2 Samsung phones and my Verizon USB 760 modem. I had 2 bars. Then came the moment of truth. I fired up the amp and really didn't notice all that much difference, untill I was 6-8 feet from the desktop antenna. I did gain 2 bars when within 6-8 foot of the antenna, BUT when you move farther away than 10 feet, back to same old 2 bar signal strength. Next was the modem test. Computer is 20 foot from desktop antenna..NO DIFFERENCE.....So I pulled my cords/cables (glad I left 15 feet extra)so I could put the antenna within 5 feet of my modem..Went to full blown 4 bars and 4 bars on EV as well..It did speed up the data transfer/web surfing. I guess the main point here is... If you're within 10 feet of the desktop antenna..You will notice a difference. anymore than that FORGET IT !! THIS IS NOT A WHOLE HOME SOLUTION !!

"This is a great phone for those on a budget (like me!) It's one step down from the v400. So if you can afford it, get the v400 instead! The v400 has a ton of included themes and photos, and more memory (5 MBs) compared to this phone, which is sort of ""bare bones"" (1.8mb). Both have the same quality camera and photos, although the v400 has a better screen. Both phones can have .mp3's playing as ringtones. The v220 has very clear sound quality, great screen and excellent battery life. My only problem with it is that there is NO SUPPORT from motorola for a data link cable. The V220 connects via a small USB plug, but you have to order the datalink software & drivers from motorola before you can use it (another fourty bucks! And Cingular didn't stock it, only Motorola does, on a very remote part of their site). I got my software on a file-sharing program because I've NEVER heard of a company charging money just for DRIVERS!! All-in-all I'm loving my new phone (I've had it for several weeks). I've been able to get rid of my palm pilot because it holds 1,250 contacts (with the Simm Card). One note - if you add your contacts to the phone's memory (as opposed to the Simm's) you will have to set the ringer for each contact or else it defaults to no ring). The motorola software also allows you to sync to your Microsoft Outlook contacts and calendar, and it was truly easy to use! This phone is a great way to feel like you've got tons of money, because it's basically just a ""baby"" version of the v400 (which retails for about $150 more usually).

"I recieved this phone for 50 bucks with a 2 year contract and wow this is just terrible. I'll start with the few pros, there is a good deal of features but nothing that lg or samsung phones don't have. Now the cons, the camera is fuzzy overall bad, there is a very low amount of memory. usb driver costs a whopping 50 dollars from cingular, so transferring the pics is a big wallet drainer. The battery meter is terrible, it indicates 4 bars out of 4 then goes 1 hour later to one bar. It completely defeats the purpose of having a meter. U can't record ur voice and use it as a ringtone. Coverage is terrible on Cingular's gsm network, number of dropped calls is amazing with this phone. (I live in CT) Now for the worst part of this phone that should make u not buy this, whenever there is a ring, data exchange of any kind, the phone creates extreme disturbance with nearby electronic devices. Particularly speakers, if you like music, forfeit this phone, the crackling increases the amp volume and eventually kills your speakers. My brand new harmon kardon speakers for example, were victims of this, now the right tweeter continues to make a constant crackling sound, Not only is this phone terrible as phone, it manages to ruin the speakers of my house. I had to unplug my intercom system because of this thing. The crackling sound is a very annoying high pitch problem. Even if your volume is set low, it manages to increase the amp volume. At this point, I don't even know if this is legal for a cell phone. If u get this phone, get a lawyer while ur at it.",negative,negative,0.854915705191799,0.13590148603442226,0.009182808773778748

"Whether one blames it on the design of the Centro itself or on the battery, the length of time a Centro can run on this battery is too short. After a few months of use a Centro battery will barely sustain the device for a 12-hr. day even if no calls are made (and that's without Bluetooth's being active, which makes things worse). The time between charges can be improved by disconnecting the phone from the mobile service provider when you don't need it, provided you don't need it to be active for incoming calls, and de-activating Bluetooth when not needed. I don't know that there's much that can be done about this with current (pun intended, sort of) technology. Batteries are charged (there I go again) with providing more and longer power as each processor runs faster and a single device serves as a PIM/PDA, telephone, camera, MP3 player, data repository, and auxiliary brain for its user, at the same time as those very same marvels get even lighter & more compact, leaving little room for the battery, which occupies a significant portion of the device. The battery slips easily into the Centro or a separate charger. I highly recommend buying a spare battery with charger--that combination is available--especially if you plan to use the phone for playing MP3s too. The good news about the battery's being small, which of course is why it doesn't last long throughout the day, is that you can stick a spare in your wallet, pocket, or purse without much bother. A car charger is also helpful to give your heavily utilized Centro a second wind during the day. If you plan to travel with it--and that's obviously when the device is at its most helpful, carry along enough charged-up spares to get you between home and hotel power outlets. Under travel conditions you may want to have at least one charger for every two batteries; the chargers fortunately aren't much bigger than the battery, except for the cord.",neutral,neutral,0.028254417502871762,0.8444605118563763,0.127285070640752

"I have had a pretty good experience with the operation of the headset: - Comfort (5 star): Really the biggest strength. Over ear and nothing inside the ear makes this great for me. - Performance (3 star): Has been inconsistent. When I have tested the headset by calling my home phone, the sound is great. I often have people on calls ask me if I am on my cell or a headset. When I go back to the cell alone it seems to be fine (so not a cellular reception issue). - Other (? star): I plugged this in to charge it on the weekend. I have owned this since April and it has been charged 4-5 times. I started to smell plastic burning. I pulled out the plug and realized that the little headset was blazing hot and that the plastic was soft. Pretty scary situation. This was all with the Sennheiser cable and charger. I sent an email to customer service at Sennheiser this morning. They have a two year warranty which is pretty impressive. The reply was professional, but just a form letter. I would just think that if a human had read my email they would have been really concerned. I offered to speak with them on the phone and do whatever they want to determine the issues.

"I bought those to replace my LG HBS-730 after they started freaking out on my and were out of warranty. I decided I might as well try the Motorola Buds in case they were more resistant to sweat, see I run with those things on. Well I regret my purchase now, the Buds start freaking out after mile 2, as soon as I start sweating a little, it doesn't take much. The volume and skip buttons stop responding or press themselves without user input and the power button stops working. The buds start working again once they dry out but the second part of your run is screwed. In addition to that the Buds themselves are a little narrow and stiff, which means putting them on makes you worried about splitting them apart. To add insult to injury the power button is placed in the worst possible place, in the center back and on the underside which is very awkward to operate if you have them on. You kinda have to take them on and off to turn them on or off. Bad bad bad design. I might have to buy LG again even though they ended up dying but they lasted months before they were irreparably damaged by sweat (I'm assuming) compared to the Buds which started failing immediately but do come back to life when dry (which is why they get two stars instead of one).",negative,negative,0.8019608697025317,0.09903599160507079,0.09900313869239753

Additionally, the distance range from phone to bluetooth is far from perfect. If you leave your phone in another room, or the signal must pass through walls, the other party on the phone cannot hear you, and the phone states ""Bluetooth Signal Weak."" However, when the unit is charged, and when there is not a far distance between the unit and the phone, the reception is very good. Generally, I can hear other party very clearly, and they can hear me. The volume can be adjusted very high, which is nice when there is background noise. The design of how the unit hooks on the ear has much to be desired.

"PLEASE, PLEASE READ MY WHOLE ARTICLE BEFORE BUYING ANY BOOSTER SYSTEMS. I purchased this booster some time ago, Oct 2009. Upon installation, I did not see any improvement. I contacted Wi-Ex and after a few days of bitching, they sent me a new system. The new system was a bit better but still did not do what they claim it to do. I've continued to use this booster for 8 months total now and here is my analysis. First, they claim that this unit will cover a home of 2500 sq ft. LIE. Second, they claim that this will reduce dropped calls... HALF A LIE Here are the facts: 1- You will only get a boosted signal from the base unit ONLY if the receiving antenna has a strong signal. I have 2 bars in my attic, where the receiving antenna is installed, and the coverage range from the base unit is only anywhere from 2 inches to 3 feet from the base unit. 2- In my situation, the coverage area dramatically drops as soon as I'm out of the 3 foot radius of the base unit. As soon as I'm about 10 feet from the base unit, the signal will drop to zero bars on my phone (Palm Pre) and the phone will intermittently switch to Roaming. (This also occurs with an HTC Touch Pro 2 as well). I contacted Wi-Ex and they told me that the max range of the boosted signal will be 15 feet. That's right, he said 15 feet. They why do they advertise full house coverage? And also claim a 2500 sq ft home coverage on this unit. I was also told that if my input signal is only two bars, that the output from the base unit is reduced to a lower radius/range. This is not what is advertised. As a matter of fact, while I was on the phone with the rep, he kept asking me to repeat myself because I kept breaking up. He asked me to repeat myself three times, yes, three times, and my distance to the base unit? About two feet at that time and the bar strength indication on the phone? That was at 1 bar!! Yes, 1 bar!!! So basically, if you have full bars (a strong signal) outside of your home, then the boosted signal inside your home will be greater. I want everyone to know this. DO NOT BE MISGUIDED!!!! This system is only as good as your signal outside your home. If you have FULL strength outside your home and have no signal strength inside your --- a basement for example, then, you will have good coverage in your basement room ONLY. Also, I wanted to troubleshoot this some more so I bought a Wilson 800/1900 booster. Identical to this Wi-Ex unit. I tried a combination of several things. I used the Wi-Ex receiver with the Wilson base and the Wilson transmitting antenna, the Wilson receiving antenna with the Wi-Ex base unit and the Wilson antenna and so forth..... and this is what I learned: The Wilson system gives you a better coverage radius than the Wi-Ex unit. However, the Wilson unit continuously loses it's signal and the base unit's LED will switch from green to amber to red quite often! Again, neither of these units really improves your indoor signal if your outdoor signal is not at 100%. DO NOT EXPECT YOUR INDOOR RECEPTION TO BE BOOSTED THROUGHOUT YOUR ENTIRE 2500 SQ FT HOME!! This will NOT happen. These two units are misrepresented to make a sale. This is not to say that the Wilson is a better buy, it is not! The coverage radius is only increased by about 1 foot using the Wilson unit. As soon as you are out of this range, your signal will drop and switch over to Roaming as well. Do not waste your money on either of these two systems if all you need is coverage at your computer desk. You might as well buy their lower priced units that you suction cup to your window. These will give you that same result and you don't have to climb into your attic or bore holes in your home to hang an external antenna. More importantly, they cost about $100 less. I have disconnected both units and the signal strength at my desk is at 2 bars without a booster. (Intermittently of course but good enough and better than with the boosters in place). I of course, lose my signal in the basement, but the boosters didn't provide me with better signal strength either so for me, it's not a loss. Note: I did abide by the distance requirements called for by each manufacture and those called for by the FCC. I only operated my cell in close proximity only to perform my tests.

"I'll start off by saying i got a great deal on this phone ($75) so i'm definitely happy with my purchase. For me there are 2 main drawbacks with this phone. The first was noted by another reviewer which is there is no silent way to go from having the ring on to turning it off as it rings at each regression from level 5 to silent, you can't turn it from ringer to silent another way. You can just turn the phone off but thats annoying too since you cant see what you missed. The other main drawback is that the volume is wayyyy too low. When i'm in any sort of social setting I have a real problems hearing what the other person is saying, even at a mildy busy bar with no music on, just the general activity in the bar is enough to have me straining. But that being said I do enjoy the phone, I can usually find some place quiet enough or step outside and i'm in the habit now of fiddling witht he ring volume before i go somewhere quiet or just turn it off when i get in. It's not that big of a deal. I have no problems with anything else, i find it easy enough to navigate and don't notice a lag time when going through the menus. It seems to be really sturdy and looks nice and i never notice it in my pocket. It is so ridiculously thin!! Although some people think it looks really wide when you hold up their phone to it, theres usually about a 1cm difference in width and a 1/2 cm difference in height, hardly worth mentioning. its got a cool camera that takes good pictures and overall i really enjoy it, and at $75 i don't regret my purchase at all.

"It's important to note the difference between the phone that you have and the service you get. Both are important when it comes to thinking about your purchase. The Motorola RAZR phone was very hot just a few years ago, and has now fallen out of the spotlight to the chocolater, pearl, and upcoming Apple iPhone. In particular, the web/email features are quite lacking. That said, the v3 phone itself is a reliable and good device, that is super slim and perfect to be used when you need something small and handy. I have a blackberry as well, and use my RAZR whenever I head out for dinner and need a phone that I can slip into my pocket or jacket. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about Cingular. In many places, particularly Northern and Southern California, Cingular has spotty coverage which causes you to drop your calls. Furthermore, customer service is polite but is most unhelpful, particularly compared to other service providers. I have spoken to many Cingular customer service reps and supervisors (an issue in itself), and while all have been very polite, they have never actually delivered on any of my requests. The Cingular coverage and service makes your RAZR phone unuseable, so much so that I was willing to pay the early termination fee to switch to a different provider. Bottom line, the RAZR is a fun and useful phone, just look to get it through a different service provider.",neutral,positive,0.1377734582217482,0.15155856893679875,0.710667972841453
"I like the Treo Centro. It runs on the very dependable Sprint CDMA/EV-DO network. But it is the same phone as the Treo 600 that came out back in 2003. Palm decided that since the 600 was such a big success, that they had no need to make any kind of effort in designing a new phone. This holds true with the Centro. This phone has the (((SAME))) hardware as the Treo 600, 650, 700, 750, ect. Just a bit more memory and a so-called updated OS. The OS might have an update number of 5.4.9, but there is zero difference in the OS. I can not tell a difference at all. This is sad seeing as they made a Lunix based OS called Cobalt years ago and it has never seen the light of day. The Centro still has the same bugs as every Treo since the 600. Start-up time is very slow. Which is really bad when you are in need of making an important phone call, and the phone resets for no reason. Making you wait up to 60+ seconds for it to come back online. The limited RAM of 64MB's, is so much lower then most PDA's currently on the market. You can use ZLaucher to transfer programs to a memory card, but this can not be done with all software. And since the web browser uses RAM, not memory cards, you still only have 8MB's to work with in Blazer. All software must be loaded into RAM before being it can run, So prepare for the phone to reset at least once a day to get the those limited RAM resources back. Still no WiFi, which was the complaint in 2003 and Palm has not added it yet. The Centro still has the same 312 MHz Intel XScale processor. Signal strength is still pretty strong, but voice quality is still not great when compared to every other phone I have used before. Sprint is marketing this as an affordable PDA at $99 with a contract. But when you know that the hardware is going on 5 years old, price really doesn't make current PDA owners care a whole lot. I bought the Centro because I hated my Motorola RAZR 2 and I needed to get something better. But after using the Centro for over a month now, I see no difference what-so-ever in this PDA and the Treo 600 and 650 that I owned a few years ago. Smaller packaging, but the same phone. The Centro is a good example of what a PDA maker SHOULD NOT DO. While Motorola, Nokia, Samsung, HTC, ect have all updated their lineups with powerful PDA's, Palm has sat idly by doing nothing with their forum star power. Palm used to control a huge chuck of the PDA software market, but now Microsoft has caught up and passed PalmOS by. No new companies have used PalmOS. Let me rephrase that, NO ONE is using the PalmOS anymore; except for Palm. So if you don't have a PDA and want an affordable one, then the Centro might be for you. If you want power, then Sprint has much better PDA's then the aged and milked-to-death Treo's. More then likely the Centro will be the last PDA-Phone ever made by Palm.

"Build quality is nice, & I like the way it's designed. If it weren't for 2 problems, it would get high marks. 1st, the mounting solutions were not very workable. I wasn't about to screw into my dash, but I knew this from the start. I had high hopes for the sticky tape, but it didn't hold at all. Maybe that's just because of the texture of the surfaces in my car, or maybe it's just too heavy for sticky tape. Maybe I could have bought some heavy-duty sticky tape & tried to use more, but I found it wedged well between the passenger seat & the center console. If this were the only problem, I would have wanted to rate it a 4.5 because it's a predictable issue. 2nd, the plug never fit very well into the socket, and then it temporarily disconnected & reconnected whenever the car hit a pot hole or bump in the road. Which was very annoying considering it was powering my bluetooth FM transmitter to play music, and the thing would emit a horrible high-pitched beep through the car speakers when powering back up - usually before I could react & mute it. Very frustrating. I realize that car power sockets are not reliably standard in size, so I hate to take off a lot for it...but the point is that in my case it fits...until it blips...and that makes it much less useful. I'm passing it on to someone else in the family to see if they can use it.",neutral,neutral,0.10072099666903456,0.8927205790642764,0.00655842426668899

Don't do this. I know from experience it will instantly fry the device just slightly quicker than I realized what I was doing.

"I bought the Nokia 1600 from Net 10 and was VERY pleased with the Quality of the phone and Service; however, I decided to upgrade to the Motorola W375 and Whoa!!! This phone is a power hog!!! or maybe I got a crappy battery. I had noticed that the on/off button was picky and inconsistent about how long to hold it down to turn the phone on and off (usually 5 seconds to power on is normal). I noticed that the games on this phone are awesome; however, the phone's processor is not fast enough to provide smooth video to the screen during game play - the games are so fun that one seriously stresses to overlook this petty annoyance . I was also disappointed with the speed of Net 10's web access (""data services"") on this phone, it took over 10 minutes to load the default homepage. I have lots of experience with mobile devices, networks, computers, etc. and have just ventured into the world of cell phones. Cell phone technology reminds me of the palm pilot technologies, only with less flexibility for synchronization with a PC ( although this is subject to change based on the phones offered by the carrier). I did notice the USB port on the phone( it's used to charge the phone's battery). I didn't like the silicone cover for the USB port that dangles off the phone, it could be torn off with normal wear and tear. I did like the fact that Motorola offers phone tools software but, sadly, I never got a chance to fully explore the functionality of it with the W375.",neutral,neutral,0.04600359885003441,0.8758931919933021,0.07810320915666344
"Some of the third party sellers are not selling this headset in new condition. I received one in generic packaging from PC Micro Store that was missing the quick start guide and the warranty card. Disappointed to see the crappy packaging, still more disappointed to see it's missing parts and looks suspiciously used, but at least the charger, cable and ear loops were there. However, upon charging it and trying to pair, it would not enter pairing mode. Suspecting it may have been used before, I reset the device and it went directly into pairing mode. It had already been paired to three devices and the headset memory was full. If I wanted a used headset, I would have bought a used one, this was supposed to be new in retail packaging. Problem with the seller, not the product, but still Amazon's fault as it was ""Fulfilled by Amazon"" certified or whatever. I like the headset so far. It's well built, smaller than I expected, and the LED indicators are pretty cool. Sound quality is much better on my iPhone 3GS than two Jawbone Primes, which never worked right. Not super comfortable, but not bad. Edit 1/14/11: Amazon customer service is great. I emailed them to complain about this, and they apologized and gave me a credit for the entire purchase price. Lesson learned, be careful who you order this headset from, but if it's through an Amazon (""Fulfilled by"") partner they will take care of you. Edit 1/20/11: Flashed the Z9 from version 3.3 directly to the Z9i version 1.1, works great. Headset now automatically reconnects to the iPhone 3GS (without having to manually push the multifunction button). One bug with the 3GS and this headset is that voice dialing for some reason makes the Z9i shut off.

"Palm - 700w - Verizon Model I've been using this PALM TREO for a couple months now and would recommended to others... look very hard at this phone and rationalize why you want it before stepping forward. The hardware in itself seems very solid and reliable. This TREO package has several great items. And if you're looking at it to use Microsoft Mobile and the Palm calendar function, to Sync to Outlook and staying current on appointments and events. These features of pretty solid. Battery life and performance is pretty good. If you're a RIM or Blackberry user the Keyboard is a snap and easy to use. The pointer stick keypad is a nice feature too... The display is fair and you can see it in most lighting situations other then direct sunlight. Be sure to buy screen protective covers.... And a couple of the programs I've purchased to run on MS mobile work well, as long as you only run one at a time. Speakerphone works OK, but the Mic picks up all background noise. The very first thing when you get your TREO ... look for MS updates and flash the phone. My Phone was delivered direct from Verizon with an older operating release installed. Palm had posted a new release two months prior. With current updated there's still several irritants. As a long time Verizon customer I don't see these issues as their base cell phone service problems. It appears to be Palm & MS. And I would expect the same from other providers, I know of a couple Sprint users stating they're seeing the same issues. My opinion as a customer, if Verizon wants return customers I would be leveraging Palm to correct the issues or buy back or exchange these phones from their customers'. And like all items we spend our hard earned cash on! .... We tend to migrate to gravitate to the negative items. 1. Microsoft Mobile tends to work like most MS operation systems. It locks up and requires a reboots on a regular basis.. I've learned just to soft boot the device weekly to reduce the issue. Even with the most recent OS update. 2. Most of the TREO functions & options have very primitive settings and functionality. If you're used to Motorola & Blackberry phones and use the many options and phone tools, You will be disappointed! Palm is lacking this flexibility. You're forced to buy software to do some of the task you might be use too. This device has a lack of memory issue, which will cause you problems too. You can pretty much expect to be able to load about 100 addresses, phone numbers and a couple very small MS Word docs before you run out of memory. Running the application from a SD card works well until you bump the card and it ejects. You can expect the MS Mobile to crash 30% of the time. 3. I've tried several different Bluetooth ear pieces and in general the phone does a poor job in connecting and managing the devices. Sound quality is poor, did I say poor!. I've used every device Palm and Verizon has recommended. And if you get more than about 8 feet from the phone it goes out..... In addition at least once a week the Bluetooth device setting get turned off and need to be reactivated. 3. Phone connectivity is questionable. If your switching from a TRImode phone you will drop kick this phone. Dropped calls will be a part of you daily route until you re-learn the digital coverage areas. Forget about call waiting. It drops the calls and will disconnected the holding party most of the time. I used and all digital Motorola phone and it out performs this TREO phone in service connectivity.... and sound quality by a large margin. 4. Phone connections and dialing take longer and seems to have a very long pause when connecting to outgoing calls. There is also a lot of sound quality delays, sound pauses and cutting out in the middles of conversations. Unlike some phones there seems to be no noise cancellation or filtering in this device. It picks up all background noise. 5. Voice dialing.... Forget it. Not worth setting up..... Other phones are a snap and work. This one is too temperamental.... It selects the wrong names. 6. MP3 Player ....Don't expect to store MP3 on the base memory. You will be forced to use the storage card due to the memory constraint device. And as a point, the player library manager seems to repetitively default back to main memory and you can't find your music. The the MS Player has a very low sound quality, even with excellent headsets...... Expect to by a jack plug converter. The plug is smaller then those on MP3 players.. 7. WEB browsing is extremely slow and if you choose sites other than the Palm sites you can expect to wait longer. And many of the Websites do not show up correctly. Event those setup for PDA's. There is a lot of WEB(Digital) signal dead areas. I've experienced a lot of dead digital signal areas where my Laptop Verizon Digital Card has excellent signal. Must be another poor Palm software item. The phone does not multiplex well. It has problems managing the Phone, Web and PDA items if you trying to run them all at the same time. Odds this is due to the lack of base memory or slow processor. The bottom line is.... I'm not sure I would venture into the MS Mobile phones unless you know what you want to use it for. I feel this is and emerging market and still in development. And it will be a while before it becomes a great product. Time will tell. I plan to keep the TREO 700w. Because it is to late to return it! But I would take my money back and try something else if I had the chance.. One last note..... The joke commercial Verizon continues to run when they say ""Can You Hear Me Now"" .... You will be using this line a lot with this phone. It cuts out allot...",neutral,neutral,0.3469539646190313,0.5789920206350645,0.07405401474590438

"The technology couldn't be better. Bluetooth conecteivity is simple to establish. The overall physical design is excellent. Though it looks heavy, the unit is a featherweight and fits nicely around the ear. Long-term wearing is comfortable. Audio fidelity is excellent. Where the unit fails badly, though, is the controls. They do not provide enough tactile input. You cannot be certain of where the volume control is or which end of the rocker switch increases or decreases the volume. Since the volume defaults to moderately low setting, this means you are likely to miss the first words of whatever your caller is saying which in turn means a lot of asking ""what did you say?"". The Call Control button handles at least four different functions. On a phone equipped to handle all four functions, it is easy to mistakenly select a function. For example, on my phone, if I hold the Call Control button a fraction too long, the call is not answered, but the prompt to enter a Voice Speed Dial entry is actuated. No fun when you are trying to answer a call. Plantronics provides three earpiece inserts and it's unlikely that one of them won't provide a comfortable, snug fit. Overall, excellent technology marred by poor ergonomics. Jerry",neutral,neutral,0.2673098020664787,0.44561269076471,0.28707750716881136

"This is a nice product, a very nice phone (or should I say ""very nice ALL-IN-ONE PHONE""?), I gotta tell you, it worth every penny, first days I was a little upset because I didn't get into it, but now... seems to be a nice solution for a lot of things, what I have installed in my AIO PHONE: 1. Skype 2. MSN 3. Office Viewer 4. Lots of games (metal gear solid acid for mobiles, fifa, etc) 5. Internet using WiFi corporate network (you can specify the type of encryption, open/shared, IPV4 y IPV6, sutnet, gateways and DNSs) 6. Yahoo Chat 7. Google Talk 8.

You can synchronize it with Windows Media Player what is nice too, because is easy to find WMP already installed in your computer (against the ipod/iphone-itunes, you have to download it and is a little tricky) 12. ETC. Of course, not everything is PINK, and has some cons: 1. Is just a bit bigger and heavier than the w810, but if you think you're getting WiFi, you forget that. 2. I guess... is easier to use a sony ericsson, but every feature included in the N81 worth to learn something new. 3. The storage (8gb) is built-in, and it has not any slot to expand the capacity, but again, I guess 8gb is enough space for applications, games and music. 4.

The realplayer is the player included with the phone, and only plays mp4 and 3gp, the resolution on the screen is nice, but, sometimes, when you're trying to watch videos from YouTube.com (yes, you can watch streaming video too) the player get fuzzy... and you should close and open again the video in order to get a better display.

"I wanted a headset to use with my new Samsun i730 Pocket PC phone (way cool), as well as, use with my 5.8GHz cordless home phone via a Jabra A210 bluetooth adapter, and this hit the mark. This was the only headset I found to synchronize with TWO devices, so I paired it easily with the i730, then the Jabra A210 adapter, and whola, whichever rings if I am close to both, I can answer either line with just one headset. I bought and test the Jabra BT250V and BT800, the 250V sounded good and was pretty comfortable, but could NOT sync with TWO devices at the same time, and the BT800 was cool, but it was not secure on my ear and let in too much outside noise. The Plantronics 510 sounds the best of them all, and it is extremely comfortable, I had it on for 3 hours one day and it was still fine. I love the configuration of the small boom with the behind the ear battery, great design. The battery life has been great as well, I have been getting 4+ hours of straight talk time and several days of standby. The AC charger is pretty small as well, nice for travel. Also, this headset had the least amount of static from what I would assume to be the bluetooth connection (actually, there is NO static most of the time), while both the Jabra ones had a bit of static, the BT800 being the better of the two Jabra headsets for me. Oh, and I got this thing for $50 on amazon... what a deal, I cannot believe what terrific sounds and functionality at this price! Gripes: I hate to say there are any gripes because I really like this headset, but we are hear for full disclosure and helping eachother with thorough reviews, so here they are... I did like the vibrate option of the Jabra devices, which this does not have. Also, not sure if it is just my device, but the power button is not very tactile, which means, when I press it, it does not feel like it moves and I cannot feel any detent, but I have been able to use the button without much issue. Needless to say I love this headset and put this as my first choice if anyone asks for my recommendation. Cheers!!!!",positive,positive,0.06611004413738512,0.1944693417623309,0.7394206141002839
"It works for me, but just barely. I am using it in my office. My office does not have an outside wall, and I was getting zero to 1 bars without it. When I first installed this, I was able to find a location next to the ceiling where I had two bars consistently. I located the window unit there, but even though my phone showed 2 or 3 bars, my calls broke up severely. A few days ago, I put the window unit above the ceiling, where I had three bars, and it started working. However, the only way it works is if I leave my phone sitting next to the antenna, and use my bluetooth. If I move my phone as little as 6"" away I go to 0-1 bars. Any farther and I have no bars. My other big problem is that if the antenna is too close to the window unit, there is a back feed, and it stops working. That wouldn't be a huge problem, except the wire isn't all that long, and once you run it down the wall, and across the room, it is nearly impossible for it not to pick up the antenna and it stops working. Since installing it in the ceiling this problem went away, but I can no longer run the wire all the way to the floor and over to my desk. It looks pretty bad, and it may cause me problems with my boss. I wish I could add another 12-20 feet so I can install it neatly. Bottom line. If you don't have at least 3 bars where you locate the window unit, and you can't leave your phone sitting next to the antenna, then I would recommend you stay away from this item. One other comment is that I think it should be designed to work the other way around. The black antenna should mount on the window and the main unit should be located near the phone. Running both power and the antenna wire into the ceiling or to a window is just plain stupid. But, for $50 it is working for me, and I'm happier than I was.",neutral,neutral,0.053193541810456935,0.7308898642521224,0.21591659393742066
"MARCH 2017 UPDATE - I see they dropped the price so some may think 18 months of use is ok. For myself, about 6 months ago (less than 18 months) the right speaker went out. Pfft! I tolerated since I just do calls/podcasts that don't require stereo. Now it just cuts in and out. Verified with another headset that it's not my iPhone 5 (looking to upgrade soon!). To my mind, a solid state device that only sits around my neck and has this much space for quality innards should last a decade. My old Sony wired headset speakers lasted that long. The solidly-constructed bud-wires beat out the LG Tone, but that's not saying much in my book. APRIL 2015 - I had an LG Tone I really liked, but the build quality of the wires to the earbuds cracked and severed in less than a year! Doesn't seem to have been fixed in later models, so I put replacing on hold for the past year. Came across these from Motorola and they looked good. I've had good experiences with Motorola products in the past and I liked the explicit mention of the earbud wires being ""linguine"" and that they use magnets to hold the earbuds to the neckset. So I ordered. Having had them a couple days, here's what I have to say. First the neckset is much stiffer and narrower than the Tone. Fine for me, but definitely going to be a problem for many. Because of the stiffness, they're more difficult to remove from the neck than the Tone. Also, no vibration when a call comes in, unlike the Tone. If you haven't an earbud in your ear, you might miss a call. Pairing was easy with my iPhone 5. Not so easy was pressing the Call button (looks like the pic in the manual is reversed) to summon Siri. At first, doing that resulted in playing music from my iPhone and I had a hard time getting that to stop. Seem to have worked it out now. The audio for music is pretty good. The USB charge cord is super short. If you have the earbuds in, you do hear some odd sounds sometimes. In terms of wearability and style and maybe even the sound, I'll give the edge to LG Tone, but LG Tone is no good if you spend that much for a headset that doesn't make it through at least a year. I feel pretty confident, though it's early days of course, that this Motorola stereo Bluetooth is going to give me at least a couple years of service. Fingers crossed.

"Works better some days than others. Seems like putting external antenna in the attic is not getting the amount of signal needed to boost it through the house via the internal antenna and amplifier. It does bring the signal in to different levels of the house, but does result in poor voice quality at times.

"This is a great design! Looks awesome! Great concepts! How does it work? Eh... decent. There are problems with this HS being used with a V3c. Its been said before. STATIC. No idea why but it comes and goes as it pleases. For the most part I have had good luck on my side. Static hasn't been a big issue but yes its there. Depending on where you place your V3c. In my pocket sometimes I get bad static. I also get the ECHO. But if the V3c is in line of sight with the H700 static is not a problem. I have tested this thing out many times and at times people tell me I sound ""muffled"" while other times people say its fine. So in all the H700 has its downsides. Its not consistent at all. But it does work good when it works! I'm going to hold on to this one but I may try another brand out to see how it holds up. Jabra BT800 is another one that isn't so good and the Moto H3 just doesn't work at all with the V3c. I love the concept of being able to open the boom to turn the headset on (rather than the infamous hold the button for 5-7 second rule).

"Hi, I had total of 2 of these headsets and I actually liked the headset at first because of the way it fit my ear, which was very tight and sturdy. The very first one that I bought I had troubles to get it connected to my phone right away, which what I thought at first could be a compatibility issue with my phone, even though my previous headset (Motorola H375 - see my review about it) NEVER had this types of connectivity issues (but it did have some durability issues of it's own). So after playing around with it I ended up doing a hard reset on my phone, after which I was able to finally get it connected. I've been using this headset for about 3 months, during which I had some connection issues every now and then, but I was always able to get it resolved each time after playing around with the settings and the phone, which in some cases took quite a while. Anyways, the last month the connections issues started happening more and more often and one day my phone wouldn't see the headset at all. I tried my old cell phone and my wife's cell phone to recognize the headset, but neither one would ""see"" it, even though the headset itself seemed to power up and making appropriate sounds as if it was in a pairing mode. Ok, I thought maybe it was my bad luck with getting a defective piece, so, since I REALLY liked the durability and fit of this particular headset, I went online and ordered another brand new headset just like this. The story with this one was that it would power up but none of my phones would be able to recognize it from the very beginning after I received it, so I am sending this 2nd one back for a refund and looking for another substitute in the meantime. Even though I really liked the way it fit my ear, I will not waste another dollar or a minute of my time trying to get one of these to work. For all these reasons I do not recommend anyone to buy it. Try something else and hopefully you will have a better luck with it. Cheers!",negative,negative,0.9144268921246241,0.08169679826533958,0.003876309610036345

"Stupidly, I spent $900 on this phone the very week it was made available for sale in the U.S., and then I bought a second one as a gift. The phone kept turning itself off automatically, even when loaded with a fully charged battery. So Nokia sent me a replacement phone (number 1), which had some loose schmutz under the screen. So Nokia sent me another replacement phone (number 2), whose keypad backlighting did not illuminate whenever I opened the slide. So Nokia sent me another replacement phone (number 3), which automatically and inexplicably lost its WAP settings every time I had to switch the phone off. So Nokia sent me yet another replacement phone (number 4), which slid open too far on its very first use, exposing the wiring and circuitry and rendering it impossible to use. So Nokia -- God bless them -- sent me one more replacement phone (number 5), which I have been using for just over one week now and which no longer makes a keypad tone whenever I dial the 3, 6, 9, or # keys. The phone looks and feels sleek, yes. The charging base emanates a pulsating blue light. The ringtones, composed by Ryuichi Sakamoto, are beautiful. But this phone is a colossal waste of money: all style with no substance. The battery lasts a pitifully short length of time before needing to be recharged.

"Motorola RIZR First blush, day 1: Attractive phone, feels good & sturdy in the hand, buttons are very responsive, slide function is easy to use and graceful, GUI is not exactly pretty but mostly very intuitive. Rather well put together phone. Why'd I get this phone: quad band, Bluetooth, good camera, a music player (or two actually, confusing) which seemed decent in the store. And because it was NOT a flip phone (which I loath), Tmo didn't have a decent candy bar (which I love), and ... it was not a Samsung (take that for what it's worth). Pros: 1. Great camera compared to what I've had (SE T610, Samsung T809) with very strong flash, actually, it's like a flash light. Can I smart button this function anyone? 2. So far, reception is pretty good, antenna stronger than my old & beat up SE t610, and comparable to my Samsung t809 (which broke), but sometimes the call is scratchy or does that computer reverberation like sound (which I've never experienced on my other phones). 3. iTap text message entry is pretty impressive/smart (this is my first Motorola phone). I'm not sure of how it is implemented on other Motorolas but I like it on this one. I miss a few choices of T9 on my SE t610 (w/ Tmo) but iTap is cool. Cons: 1. No timer or stopwatch 2. No analog clock option (but Moto if you're going to design one, make it look like the Nokia analog clock for the 6133 or the s60 menubar clock) 3. No mirror on the back for self pics like many Sony-Ericsson bar phones have 4. Placement of memory card: buy yourself surgical tweezers or hemostats to get this sucker out 5. Mac/Bluetooth/iSync: iSync does not work for me despite having first dl'd an iSync plug in which purports to doing so. With my Samsung this made me irate, but Moto has a good track record with iSync support so I'm waiting. 6. Headset has better mic, so others hear me better even than when I'm using the phone regularly. BUT, there's often (65% of the time) a buzz that either I can hear, or both my caller and I can hear. 7. Cannot access full menu when on a call, only some menu functions (but not text or call recording) 8. Cannot record calls 9. Some functions & settings hard to find (or completely lost) Tmo has crippled this phone in some ways: 1. no MotoReader like the Moto site for the product says (which opens MS docs) 2. the option to save text messages to the SIM card has been removed. Tmo support says they can't control this. Moto says Tmo has removed it and thus controls that aspect. 3. cannot install Java apps like the Moto site says. What? I thought this was MY phone now. Silly consumer, Deutsch Telecom owns it. Comments: 1. screen is tiny compared to others, but still is very resolute and pleasant to look at 2. camera is great, doesn't have as many fun options as my old Samsung t809 (which I really didn't like but which did have lots of ways to play with your pics when taking them like comic bubbles etc) 3. my RIZR was set to display only SIM card contacts when I first got it from Tmo which frustrated me for a while since the phone kept telling me that the newly BT transferred contact was ""outside current view"" 4. I have decided to keep the phone with Tmo despite the drawbacks I've listed. After long term use: 1. key pad lost responsiveness, would not enter some numbers, some numbers would enter two or three times, scrool pad lost sensitivity on one side. 2. after moving on to other phones, the features i miss are - flash light (simple feature, but once gone is missed) - iTap. going back to t9 is painful now! iTap took a little adjustment but once adjusted is far superior",neutral,neutral,0.09233969189698348,0.8144642115070485,0.09319609659596799

I like that it is low profile at the jack and flexible with the receiver for the headphones. I also have a Dynex DX-HPADi, which is the stiff at-the-jack style.

"I guess that i am rough on cell phones (6+ in the last 2 yrs) so I got this one as a disposable and thats what it is. It is obviously no frills and the ""frills"" it does have are pretty glitchy.

"All 3 of these accessories work wonderfully with this phone. At first when I saw the headseat, I was afraid that it was not going to plug in, but it did with no problem. Also, I can hear the person on the other end very well with the headset. The reception is very clear. It sounds way better than my dad's bluetooth. It's also good if you want to use the radio on the phone, because you need the headset to do so. The carrying case is a steal. You would not be able to get this at a Cingular store for this price. I had already bought a different type holster from the Cingular store, which cost $19.99, and it was no where as good as the one that comes with this set.

"I bought this phone in July from Radio Shack (RS). The main reason was to pair with my Acura TL.

Acura refers me to Handsfree Link, Verizon never gave them the phone for testing before moving this to production. (This is done with all other wireless companies). RS exchanged the phone in Sept. Oct. I find that it is not the car but the phone. VZ bluntly told me it is my problem, discuss it with RS. RS said discuss it with Moto. Moto states that they know there is a problem with the Bluetooth but do not know how to distribute the fix. No one will refund me the price of the phone that I bought outright and paid in excess of $400, because it is now over 30 days old. I travel nationwide and have the same reception problems in all parts of the country. My Qualcom from 1997 and My Nokia from 2001 perform better then this phone.

"Obviously the intuitiveness of the phone is dictated by Windows Mobile Smartphone 2003 - which at best can be described as OK. Feature wise it's right up there and of course it integrates seamlessly with Office via Activesync or over the internet. Which does bring up the issue of configuring it. I bought it for use with T-Mobile and I found it quite difficult to navigate which T-Mobile services I'd need to get all of the functionality on the phone - combined with the fact that since this phone is unsupported by T-Mobile, you'll need to manually configure the email/internet etc. Finally got it all figured and now everything works well. However, using all of the features will consume your battery. Heavy usage of the email and internet features will mean a battery life of about 1 1/2 days. Lighter use, or no use, brought it back up to about 3 days on standby. Sound quality is excellent and construction is above par with one caveat - the screen is made of plastic which is anything by scratch resistant.

I have this case which came with my no-longer-used Neat Receipt Professional (Neat Receipts charges for a patch just to use it on my new computer that runs on Windows 7 so I opted to get a new scanner from a company that does not charge to upgrade). It is simply a hard case that you can replace with any number of cases available at an organizer store. The case is not particularly specially built. It is similar to the hard case that encases some sunglasses. It has a flap that separates the unit from the cable it comes with. All you have to do is purchase a hard case at the drug store that for a couple of dollars and then place a good cushion such as dusting cloth or towel. Even a small pouch will do as you simply can roll a towel around the hardware. In my case my Neat Receipts Professional hardware did not last regardless of the care I took.

"Overall I agree with the ""cool"" features of most of the reviewers. My problems are: 1. The phone book lists every entry seperately (example if I put my husbands work and mobile in my phone, the address book lists 2 entries, Husband and Husband 1) This can be fixed by setting one number as primary and setting book to only show primaries, but then if you want to see other numbers you have to go back thru the settings and set to view all numbers, then set it back again after you view the number you want. This is a very annoying feature for me. 2. The ringer volume is terrible. I have tried different ringtones, but still don't hear it if it is in my purse, or if I'm in the grocery store with it in my pocket or in my car. Never had that problem with my Nokia. 3.

"I've had this phone for a little more than 6 months. It has been a poor performer and causes more problems than it's worth. My recommendation is to consider something else unless you really like the style or buy a new phone every few months. Here are my gripes: 1. The black undercoating is starting to flake off inside the front flip of phone. Scratches and other blemishes are really noticable. 2. It consistently fails to read the SmartID card precluding any use of the phone unless you power down and restart. Will read ""Insert SmartChip."" Just checked as it's recharging and you guessed it - it says it now. 3. Periodically the phone will fail to identify an access number for voicemail and it takes forever to figure out how to retrieve a usable number. 4. It takes awhile to figure out all the menu options. The phone is stacked with options to get you spend more money on add ons, but it takes your life to get to call history or easily swich to silent mode. I maybe use 1/20 of all the stuff that you can do. 5. There is often long periods after you open the phone where it says ""running"" this prevents any call until is cycles through - this is really irritating. 6. Got to be real careful when saving numbers to the phone vs. smart card. It's not real easy to move a number from the phone to the card. 7. The phone as a real low level volume when it comes to the earpiece. Unlike my last phone, I've got to really concentrate to hear callers if there is any background noise. I will say it's got a loud ring which is good.

"This is a convenient device, and I actually appreciated it for the short while it worked. The first problem came when the foam that protects the phone fell off. This was an easy fix- a little super glue did the trick. The next problem came when the expansion spring-like vise that holds the phone snug began to act up. When you put the phone in, you open the vise, place the phone in, and then snug it up. After a couple of months, this became a difficult manuever, with the vise getting jammed regularly. The final straw was when the suction cup stopped working properly, leaving me with the entire setup falling down at the most inopportune times. Strike three, into the landfill you go. A piece of junk, but you may enjoy it for a couple of months before it falls apart. I'm looking for something better.",negative,neutral,0.46235397459771593,0.5220223253444525,0.015623700057831685

"It's 4-in-1, 2Mp camera, MP3 player, Video player and ofcourse Phone. Great product. Let me tell you my experience about each of these:- Camera - great 2Mp camera. i took photos in NY in day and night. It was great quality. I downloaded it to my PC and it looked so good. Definately for 4x6 print its more than enough. MP3 player - it comes with great speaker. MP3 player is very good. just atatch your device to computer and download songs. then play as you wish Video player- take a video clip just like you do in other digital cameras. also download your own clips to it and enjoy. Phone -Look is definately a winner here. No other phone can even come closer to it. Orange color looks great. I gifted this to my wife and she loved it. Keypads are very good. Organization is very good. It feels like you are working on computer when you browse various options in phone. Overall, believe it or not, this is the best product ever made by Sony. I was planning to buy Ipod. But it is not needed now. You can do almost everything with this product. Moreover its so lightweight that you won't believe it. also you can add extra 2 GB card to it if you want more music. I have ordered a classic pearl white case for this phone. Hope to get it soon.

You will have to spend at least 1 hour with Sprint's award winning customer service team to find someone who will admit this to you. The problem is that Nokia designed their phones so that incoming messages are retrieved quickly and then viewed ""offline"" the way most providers work.

"I'll start with the bad first, given the amount of interest this phone has generated. 1) The Phonebook application is a little...wonky. Some people have said you can't add more than one piece of contact info per contact, which is NOT true. You can, but its nearly hidden underneath the ""MORE"" function while editing the contact. However, its not convenient and you cannot add additional e-mail addresses or phone numbers to your contacts using the Phone Tools app...which is annoying, since T-Mobile charges $30-40 for the hardware/software bundle. 1a) It also takes forever to scroll through your Phonebook contacts. I thought it MIGHT be caused by having some SIM contacts, so I transfered all of them to phone memory. No dice. The scroll speed is untenable. Even my wife's Moto V330 is quicker. What gives? I had to create a voice prompt for almost every contact in my list. 2) Even at full blast, the volume just isn't loud enough. Plus, the ""audio sweet spot"" on the speaker is hard to keep next to your ear. If you are planning to get a Bluetooth headset and use that exclusively, this shouldn't keep you from getting the phone. 3) Compared to a Samsung V205, a Sony Ericsson P910i and Motorola's own V330, the RAZR gets poorer reception. The previous phones mentioned all get four bars at my house. The RAZR gets 2. This even after calling T-Mobile tech support for help. Their advice? ""Keep turning the phone on and off and it will hopefully find another tower."" 4) T-Mobile offers NO games for this phone yet. Given how high profile this form factor has become, I find this level of support to be somewhat poor. I know - you don't buy a phone for its games. But just to show how lacking T-Mobile's support is...the RAZR includes a demo for BeJeweled. After the (very) short demo is over, it asks if you want to buy it. Clicking the link brings you to a webpage that says ""Sorry, we don't offer games for your phone yet"". My wife's V330 has a similar issue. She's had it for over 4 months and services like T-Mobile STILL offer no games for the phone. Again, I know you shouldn't buy a phone based on the number of games offered for it, but its still a feature, something to whittle away the time while waiting at the DMV. 5) Camera phone still only 640x480. Decent pics at that resolution, but given that there are cheaper phones on the market (I didn't get this phone for free) with higher pixel values, this is a moderate oversight on Moto's part 6) Phone response is fairly poor as well. Example - going through my contacts by pressing keys (going from Q to R to S)...so very slow. You think the phone hasn't responded so you mash the button again, at which point it responds to TWO button presses and you have to start all over again. 7) The Phone Tools application is a little user unfriendly and totally geared to people who mess around with Outlook CSVs on a daily basis. I've managed to get it to work, but not without some work. Alright, so now for the good. 1) This phone is a veritable conversation piece. Oohs and ahhs all around...if you care about that sort of thing. I usually don't. I just want a functional phone that gets good battery life, gets a decent signal and can withstand a beating (I'm a klutz). But if you do care about the conversation-worthyness of your cell phone, this one has it in spades. 2) Great battery power. I've had it on for 5 days at moderate usage and I've still got 2 bars left. 3) This is a sturdy phone. My kid has already dropped it on cement twice and I've seen NO scratches at all. Maybe I'm lucky, as another reviewer mentioned that poor build quality on his piece. I've not had any issues. The phone is rock solid. 4) The usual amount of ringtones and wallpapers....all of which are amazingly expensive. Why does it cost 2 bucks for a hi-fi ringtone lasting 20 seconds when I can buy the song at iTunes for a dollar? 5) The PhoneTools software allows you to create your OWN ringtones. I haven't played around with the software yet, so I'm going to guess that your abilities to import MP3s or CD-audio will be truncated to some degree. 6) Excellent Bluetooth performance. Haven't had the opportunity to test file transfers and such, but the RAZR's connection to my Moto BT headset is great. Doesn't matter which side of my body they are situated. Decent sound quality even at 20 feet of unobstructed space. 7) Did I mention this phone is attractve? 8) Ringtones can get quite loud, even without degrading ringtone sound quality. I wish the speaker was this loud. This phone has some serious shortcomings - most important among them is the poor performance of the Phonebook app, poor signal quality and low speaker volume. Ordinarily, I'd be bringing the phone back, like, tomorrow. But the design of the phone and its excellent BT performance makes me want to hang onto it. Hopefully, Moto learns from their mistakes and releases a RAZR V4 with better earpiece volume and snappier response times.",neutral,neutral,0.09319576968024189,0.8381692492922804,0.06863498102747762
"This was my first BT headset, purchased at an AT&T store for $120. I really like the way it looks, but I ended up returning it after a couple weeks. Reasons? I just didn't like the fit in/on my ear. Perhaps it's too heavy, or maybe the earbud doesn't fit right in my ear canal. But even after 15 minutes, I began to notice discomfort. (I'm primarily interested in using headsets for conference calls from my office.) Sound quality was quite good, both in quiet and noisy (i.e., driving or in public) environs.

"I have practiced with my M-14 basket a few times now and I really like it. It's incredibly easy to set up and take down.

"The Garmin Mobile XT comes on a 2GB micro SD card with adapters for mini and the full size card included. The software is locked to the supplied card. This is very convinient if you do not plan to use your SD card slot on your phone for anything but the Garmin Mobile XT. It proofes the product useless if you actually want to use it in order to save for instance pictures, videos, email or music on your SD card since then you need to swap those tiny cards each time you want to use the Garmin Mobile XT. Unfortunately if you do this too often the little contacts will break and you cannot use either card. Or you do not have the card handy when you need it. Garmin customer service refuses to give out an unlock code, which would make it possible to move the files from the to 3/4 full 2GB card, which ships with the Garmin Mobile XT, to something like a 4GB or 8GB card.

"UPDATE: I used this for a few months in a van, then lost the van to a fallen tree. This charger went into storage and only came out for a camping trip (I use a car battery/solar system for charging and running a fan). After a week of use, this unit failed completely. It no longer provides power to any of the 4 ports. The fuse is intact. Overall, I would say I used this device for maybe 30 days in total, spread out over a year. Note: The fuse was VERY hard to get out. OLD REVIEW FOLLOWS I can't really think of anything negative to say here. After reading all the reviews, I chose this and am glad I did. Notice that this has a large amp outlet, which some equipment will require. In my case I needed to extend the cord* on a mini-fridge and the average 12 v car socket/adapter can't handle the amperage of a compressor. Also note that the USB chargers work fine. Some people say they don't work, but they do. The worst-case scenario is that they may charge a bit slower than your desktop computer but they WILL charge. Look, if you're going on a long car ride, this will charge your phone, I don't care what kind of phone you have. Yes, if you are trying to charge a high drain device, or a device with long battery life (i.e., a tablet) then the USB ports may amount to a trickle charge...but they WILL charge, regardless of whether your i-Whatever tells you ""Not charging."" This is a lie--it is charging. If that is a problem for you then it is easily solved by using the 12v converter and the correct household AC plug in charger--i.e., don't use the provided USB port. I really liked the option of mounting this based on the design--you can use screws or just use velcro tape. But that wasn't necessary in my case. * I could have spliced the wires, but I needed additional outlets anyway, as this is a '94 van with 7 seats but only 2 outlets (everybody didn't own 5 devices back then).",negative,neutral,0.10868515171685787,0.5727013909477926,0.31861345733534957
"i got this powered usb hub mainly because my laptop only has 3 usb ports and no internal disk drive. this allows me to greatly expand the number of ports i can use at my desk without unplugging everything. i have a printer, my wireless mouse charger, my phone charger/usb hookup, ipod charger/hookup, and the external disk drive (which needs 2 ports to get enough power) all hooked up with room to spare for a flashdrive or anything else. the only thing i do not like about it is that it doesnt seem to be able to charge some things without being hooked up to the computer as well. for example my droid phone would only charge from the ports when the hub was connected to my computer, even though the hub was still plugged into an outlet. if would work in this manner it would be a lot nicer, as i did not always have my laptop hooked up when i wanted to use it to charge other electronics. however when its hooked up to the laptop it works perfectly fine in all areas that i need it to, and has made it a lot easier to have many things hooked up on a midsize desk without making a huge mess of loose cords.",positive,positive,0.012129039983586668,0.17382291694742455,0.8140480430689887

The magnet is pretty strong. There is a a visor clip for nonsecret monitoring. It will only track a trip for 8 hours of actually in motion. Any more then that and the batteries die. They may last longer if a car stops over night or something. So plan on changing the batteries EVERY DAY. The good news is the data is very powerful. It totally links to Google maps so you can click on a stop and see the exact location including the street view. This is a ton of data generated every trip is samples every few seconds so you have to scroll to see the stops but you can also very easily export to Google maps and see the trip perfectly. My next one I would buy one with a 360 antennia. Which probably costs more.,neutral,positive,0.08308708941371824,0.4143847101119881,0.5025282004742937

"This case was delivered as promised. Overall, I'm satisfied with it since I prefer a case with this form factor. Also, the case material is quite good, but I have two problems with it. First, the TX doesn't slide down all the way into the case so that the button cut-out hangs slightly too low over the top of the buttons for my taste. Second, the belt clip was rather flimsy.

"Mine must be the debunk one built on a Friday night at the shelf. My battery life on a Lithium battery roughly 10 hrs! Not as advertised or even on other comments.

The Trackstick.com website was quick to reply but I did not buy the item from them.

"So i got this phone for my sister as a replacement for her previous phone which was an old V3. I do love the styling of this phone and it has a very sturdy feel when compared to other phones in its price range. The flip opens very fluidly and I love the casing. However, thats where everything ends. I mean motorola has this beautiful screen and uses the UGLIEST interface I've ever seen. Honestly, if you were one of those people who bought into the Razr fad and seem to continue to buy more just out of habit, i really recommend going to your local AT&T first. In the cell phone market and I'm talking internationally. There are two leaders in terms of quality and design and those are Nokia and Sony Ericsson (SE). You might look at their phones and think that they have a cheaper feel to them or just seem to simple. But its not the outsides that set them apart. Its the insides. What I've always hated about motorola is that it seems like while they update the hardware from time to time, they still use the SAME useless unintuitive software they came out with like 5 years ago. I have been a loyal consumer of SE and if you take a phone from 5 years ago and compare it to one out now, you will notice more fluidity in the menus, faster shortcuts, a more intuitive system. The same goes with nokia, which used to have a simple interface but now has buffed up there menu system to compete aesthetically. I really recommend trying both phones and seeing how quickly there menus work compared to Motorola. I've lived outside of the country for 3 years and SE and Nokia always lead the market. Samsung solely relies on making their phones thinner then everyone elses and motorola is just banking on this ""High fashion"" razr/krzr/slvr styling. Yet I see them as the dominant phones in the US market! CHECK OUT SE and NOKIA before settling on simple style.

"POSITIVE: I have owned and used the BT 250 & BT 250v for almost 6 months each. I purchased the BT 500 10 days ago due to its size. The headset is much smaller than the 250 models. In addition, it has more functional answer/connect/volume buttons than the 250 models. I had pairing issues with the 250 models but not with the 500. So far, it always connects immediately, something that did not happen with the 250. The charger is a normal charger, and JABRA also offers an extra cable that fits into the USB mount of your computer/laptop, in case you want to charge it on the go...I don't understand the negative comments about the chargers by some other reviewers (unless they have an older package). NEGATIVE: The headset does not come with extra gel replacements, something that the 250 versions had as standard, in 3 different lengths. Therfore, in case the eargel does not fit in your ear, you have to purchase extra gel replacements. The volume of the headset is much lower than the 250 versions, (always comparing the maximum volume setting both on the headset and the cellphone)...this means that in a noisy environment, you won't be able to hear very clearly. The 250 versions had very high volume, even in the smallest scale. I used the 250 at the second lowest setting, while now, I use the 500 at the highest setting; at these settings, the 250's volume was much higher, making conversations easy to listen. All the above headsets, were used with a Nokia 6610, so they are directly comparable. You can draw your own conclusions, taking into consideration the much higher price...hope this helps.",neutral,neutral,0.02685360349964507,0.8459850915431126,0.12716130495724226

"I have used this item a few weeks for my Samsung Instinct mobile touch screen phone - not iPhone - while teaching sailing in the Chesapeake Bay. It works perfectly as advertised. It fit snugly in my life jacket pocket, and I tied the drawstring provided to the ""belt"" on the jacket for added protection of slipping or falling out. For extra thin phones like mine and the iPhone, Aquapac says it might not float. In my basic quick tests (in the tub, sink and in the Bay), it floated for a second before it started to sink slowly; enough time to grab it, or jump in and get it. I think if you actually captured more air in the pouch before closing/sealing it, it might be a little better. I wish there were some kind of extra floatation in the plastic seal or the knobs themselves though. But, if you are really concerned, I'm sure you could tie a float to the top and it would be fine. Using the touchscreen is really easy and almost like not being in a case. Texting with two hands in horizontal orientation is a little difficult with the virtual keyboard the phones have, but I just tucked the plastic seal and extra curve at the top behind the phone, and it was fine. If you have more air in the case, you will notice a little bubble while doing this, but you can always push air out before sealing it, and the screen is even easier to use. Ringers and sounds, including actually talking on it while in the case, are great. No one noticed that I was talking through plastic and sound in my ear was normal. Like their website says about pictures, there might be a little fog or haze, but not necessarily. My pictures were overall, except a few that reflected the sun, normal. The phone is a little tight and sticky (glossy big screen against the case) to get in and out of the case, and mine is a little narrower than the iPhone. When I added a thin silicone cover to my phone and put it in the Aquapac, it actually slid a little better in and out. Overall, it's great, and perfect for anyone that doesn't want to get their phone wet without a big case.",positive,neutral,0.00626967989964218,0.7147198193187632,0.2790105007815946

This hands free bluetooth works great. The reception is very clear and the mike works great. The only problem I have had with it is that it is uncomfortable on my ear. The loop hurts the inside of my ear. I tried cutting the loop off and it got better but it does tend to fall out sometimes. I started using it with the included ear hook to hold it in place better. I know I have a strange ear. None of those headsets that hang off the ear work for me because I have a small ear that does not lay flat against my head so I can't support those hooks. They should make a hook that can be adjusted with a wire inside to fit small ears like mine. That is why I gave it three stars. The charger works great and fast.

"I did a lot of research before I got this phone (directly from VWireless). I still don't understand why the black W755 has much higher user ratings on Amazon, so I averaged them and decided it must be basically a 4-star phone. Wrong. I've had it for five months now and Verizon has replaced the battery once and the phone once and it still has terrible battery life. I'm a light user and it's almost all for regular phone use. I rarely text and never use the internet. I wanted good reception, good sound quality, reliability, Bluetooth, and buttons made for phone dialing -- not texting. It's hard to find phones that don't have tiny little buttons these days. I basically got this one for free. I didn't have much choice in my ""price range"" but you get what you pay for. Pros: - Good reception. I get a strong signal almost everywhere. Dead zones on my old phone are greatly reduced. - Nice inside display for the price range but the outside one is pretty tiny. (Guess that's a pro and a con.) - It's purple:) Cons: - Battery life is beyond terrible. Be prepared to purchase an extended-life battery. I have to charge it at least every 48 hours even if it doesn't get used at all. I've had the battery go from just charged down to one bar with just a 45-minute voice, not speaker or Bluetooth, call. Forget about using the music player or you'll drain it totally. - Incoming voice quality is poor. So far nobody's complained about how I sound but I'm not impressed with how calls sound on my end. - Scratches easily. - Even though the keys are big and well-lit, they're flat and have no space in between keys which means you still have to look to dial. The rest of the complaints I have are probably true of most phones in this price range (like the camera is pretty bad) or specific to Verizon's intentionally messed-up software and sometimes abysmal customer service. The jury is still out on the phone reliability issue. It started garbling the sound on some calls and had to be replaced after four months. If it happens again I'll demand a different model. If Verizon didn't have superior coverage I'd never stay with them. Next time I'll pay more up front and go with a no-contract plan. Getting locked into this phone and an overpriced contract for two years was a disappointment.",neutral,neutral,0.42504814170773764,0.5062949527061271,0.06865690558613534

"I got my H700 from the Cingular store. The user experience is pretty good - call volume is reasonable and you can hear the caller pretty well. On big reason for the good sound is that the headset only presents the caller's side of the conversation; nothing from your side of the call is fed back through the headset's ear speaker. The experience for the person on the other end is not so good. The microphone is very sensitive - background noise can be heard just as well as the person speaking onto the headset. Using the H700 outside in wind also creates unwanted noise. The Bluetooth link is somewhat susceptible to interference, resulting in static. Of course, the person actually wearing the headset can't hear any of these problems. Overall, the H700 is great inside in a quite environment. I use mine at my desk and it works great. The convenience of the headset tempts one to use it on the go - but because of the reasons above I use the phone itself for calls of any importance in airports, the grocery store, walking the dog, etc.",neutral,neutral,0.02725237469551854,0.8530861194934547,0.1196615058110268

"I was very excited to try the Jawbone. And I'm still using it every day. I have found that it's not working very well for me. I can't get the only ear loop included to hold the ear piece near the ear canal. I cannot get the jawbone to stay against my face so that the noise canceling feature works. The persons I am talking to say that I'm breaking up badly, because it's not held against the face bone. When the noise canceling is off, it works fine. I take the index finger of my left hand to hold it against my face while driving, if I feel the need for the noise canceling feature. I do like that the charger works by connecting to the USB port on my computer. However, it is a fight every time, trying to get it to unplug. It has to be at just the right angle in order to get it to release. I particularly like that when I walk out of bluetooth range for a few minutes, when not using it, that it will reconnect to the phone upon returning ... even after as much as three or four minutes.

"Cell phone service is critical in my line of work. I drive a lot for my company & communication is key to get the job done fast. I needed something that will help me boost the signal & help lessen the dropped calls I experience when I'm on the road. I saw the many positive reviews on Amazon so I said ""sure I will give it a try"". If it helps with at least one extra bar signal it would be better than nothing. Installation was easy but I guess it would depend on your vehicle also and how you would want to mount it. The hardware looked commercial grade to withstand some punishment but it is not bullet proof. Instructions are easy to read & understand. Upon using it in the city I did notice an increase of full bars in most places. Out in the country was a different story. I saw 2-3 bars which was strong enough for internet use & phone calls. Then I took it to areas where I know I get dropped calls & no signal. This Wilson Electronics unit helped by getting 1 signal bar at the most. Enough to make or receive phone calls but internet took forever. I still experienced a dropped call here and there but not as much as I use to. So it actually works but it is not the miracle maker I though it would be. For the cost I would say not worth it if your going to use it sparingly. If you travel a lot in your vehicle, like everyday, I would say get it at the lowest price possible. It could pay off if you don't lose a sale because of a dropped call or no signal. So get it if you live off cell phone use. Leave it if you don't. That is my 2 cents. I have not tried it for mifi internet units because I don't have one yet.

"I had initially bought the Belkin armband from the apple store. It was a nice piece with some decent features and quality construction. However, since the case for the phone clipped onto the armband, the phone would flop around on my arm while running. Also, the band itself was a little thin with no edge seams. This caused it to dig in a little in places. So, I bought this one because of it's one piece design, wide contour coming off the case, and rolled seam on the band. In general, it is a great product. It's very comfortable and stays securely in place with no movement. Just a few quality and construction details let it down. The plastic screen cover is sewn on with ripples in it. This makes it hard to see and operate the screen. It's fine with music on shuffle, but if you're trying to watch a video while doing cardio or check on a pedometer app you have running, it's a distinct detraction.

I have tried 6 different bluetooth headsets and the one thing I hate about all of them is they are not loud enough. I always find myself pressing the headset against me ear to hear so I end up not using them because I can just put my phone up against my ear. This headset goes into your ear like an earbud and is louder than I need. I actually have to turn this one down a little bit. Beware of fake clone models from Hong Kong. There are several websites that help you find the difference between them. Even some Sprint stores were selling these. If you get one of those you will be disappointed. The easiest way to tell if you have one of them is if the LED doesn't change to blue after the charge is complete.,positive,negative,0.5033250360501943,0.4096716208864703,0.08700334306333536

"I have four of these now. I primarily use them to watch TV. I use the Miccus transmitter and they work well together. Pros Has long range when used with the Miscus Bluetooth transmitter. The sound rarely breaks up. Occasionally if I am near the running microwave or far away from the transmitter it will have a little breakup. Cons It can be difficult to switch between different Bluetooth transmitting devices so I have decided I need a separate head set for each device. Sometimes the headset connect to something I don't want it too and it is difficult to figure out what that is and force it to disconnect from that device. The little led light is off when it is connected so it is hard to tell if it is on. (Pressing the volume buttons will make it beep). One of my headsets has stopped working in one of the ears.

"I purchased this headset with high expectations. I took my time. I compared and contrasted. I read all the reviews. I thought I had made a great purchase. Unfortunately, the ergonomic design of this headset does not match the electronic design. I can't believe how badly Aliph missed the mark with this headset! First, the good. The sound from this headset rocks! The noise mitigating technology is great. I work in computer data centers the noise level often fluctuates. The set adjusts both the sound heard by the other listener and the volume that I hear. It still has very poor quality in windy environments, but I don't know of a set that doesn't. Now the bad. This headset wouldn't be allowed in Guantanamo Bay. It is pure torture to wear. The various combinations of ear bud and ear loop just gives you more ways to inflict pain on your ears. I can't wear the headset for more than about 10-15 minutes, and sometimes end calls due to the uncomfortable feeling. I used to put the set in my pocket between calls. Problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily. I contacted the company and they indicates that this is because if the loop doesn't break, the headset itself would break instead. The company told me I could ""gently"" bend the loops to fit my ear better. They also recommended Jabra ear gels instead of the Aliph ear buds. They also recommended a place that can make a custom gel earbud (for about $65 + shipping). I asked them if it felt right to them that I paid $130 (Best Buy) for their headset and then have to bend the pieces that come with it and buy a competitor's ear gel just to make it comfortable. They didn't seem to have a problem with it. I finally got around the earloop pain by bending a paper clip around my ear and using that for a loop. I do intend to buy a different ear gel bud because Aliph's just hurts my ear. Also interesting that when I told them I had relieved the loop problem with a custom bent paper clip, they never asked to see it. They don't seem interested in improving the feel of this product on the ear. All said, I would never buy this product again and cannot recommend it for use.

"I am pleased with the sound quality of the device. Volume level is adequate even when on noisy roads and people on the other end have actually remarked positively about the level of quality. I only wish the Jawbone engineers had stopped tinkering when they perfected the audio quality and not designed a fit system so complicated and brittle that it impairs my ability to actually use the device. The ear loop has about the consistency (and strength) of a paper clip. The result is something so flimsy that Jawbone Inc. considers earloops to be a consumable. After receiving the Jawbone as a gift this holiday season I was unable to use it as all of the included earloops snapped off within the first day of use. Needless to say I didn't start using the product until about February after waiting for customer service to send me replacements. Any future earloops, they tell me, will have to be purchased for $2.50 each! The sound is great but like others on here the fit leaves something to be desired. This after trying the infinite combinations of earloops and earbuds the unit comes with. Turning my head quickly often requires a readjustment even with the tightest fitting earloop. I realize that all ears are different but I've had cheap headsets that fit great because the engineers did not try to over-engineer the fit process. I am sure there are other great sounding bluetooth devices in this price range that are better constructed and will provide less aggravation. It's for that reason I can't recommend this product since its construction makes it completely unreliable.",negative,negative,0.5463694841562817,0.42662762893451595,0.027002886909202405

"When I first bought this headset, I was pretty satisfied. It handled voice dialing with my Nokia well, and the sound quality was generally good on both ends. The over-the-ear receiver was comfortable and didn't fall off. However, it has exhibited two shortcomings. First, the size is rather awkward. It doesn't fit inside my cell phone case with the phone like my previous headsets would. Second, the sound quality, especially on the receiving end, deteriorated over a few months. This seems to be a very common problem with bluetooth headsets. I've had three different headsets that started out good, but after roughly six months became unintelligible on receiving side. I'm guessing it's something to do with the microphone.

"The difference between a good cell phone and a great one is in the small details, which this phone misses. On the positive side, it has almost all of the features I want: 1. Big 2.2"" color screen with SVGA quality 2. Bluetooth for wireless earpiece/microphone. 3. Built in speakerphone 4. Voice activated dialing with bluetooth 5. 640 X 480 camera with 4X digital zoom 6. AIM Instant Messaging 7. Plays JAVA games 8. Internet and instant messaging 9. Large 5 MB memory capacity which can store lots of pictures, video and games. 10. You can purchase a cable and software to u/l and d/l pictures, ringtones, etc. directly from your computer. With a little hunting on-line, you can also get software to really mess with the phone! 11. Most thematic elements can be changed including Polyphonic ringers, wallpaper, screensavers, etc. So, what is wrong? 1. The phone book is misorganized: Almost every person I want in my phone book has a home phone number, a cell phone and a business phone. I want a phone book that has one entry for each name, and then a subdirectory for each of the different phone numbers and e-mail addresses. 2. The 5 way navigation key with center button is hard to use as it is too small, and the button in the center is hard to push, particularly if you have large fingers. 3. The ""call"" and ""hang-up"" keys are not properly backlit so that it is almost impossible to see them at night, even in a nearly pitch black room. (Why is the camera button well lit when you have no need for a camera in the dark?) 4. The hands-free voice dialing requires such precision in the timing of saying the name, and you have to say the name loud, and in a quiet environment, or it won't work. This virtually requires you to look at the phone when saying the name, which defeats the purpose of ""hands-free."" A person can look pretty stupid yelling out someone's name over and over again in the middle of the shopping mall. 5. The phone is a bit on the heavy side, at 4.3 ounces, although not horribly so. (For example, the Motorola Razr and Sanyo SCP8200 weigh in at about an ounce less.) 6. The front screen is the typical little motorola blue/gray clock display instead of a proper color screen. 7. The built in speakerphone is not loud enough, particularly when using the Motorola/Cingular leather phone ""glove"" as it covers the speaker. In summary, it is a good phone which, if Motorola had invested a bit more creativity and care in developing, could have been a great phone at the same price. Again, it is the details which are wrong.",neutral,neutral,0.08475182027564206,0.6327242130694265,0.2825239666549315

"Got this to replace a Plantronics 510, and so far my reaction is mixed. Pros: Lightweight, snug fit, great audio clarity Cons: Voice dialing doesn't work To elaborate, while the audio is great... I do miss the hands free voice dialing. I tried pairing this phone with a Motorola Razr and simply couldn't get it to work. The problem is that voice dialing is activated by holding the single button down for a ""long"" press. (Unfortunately, hold it down too long and you deactivate the phone.) Once I got the timing right, the phone still wouldn't recognize any of the names I tried saying. The message that displays on the phone about ""Speak the name"" also disappears way too fast by itself. I had no problem before with the 510, but this 610 has problems in that area. Oh yeah, for kicks I tried pairing it with a Samsung t619 too. Although the phone thinks its paired up, it doesn't register anything I do beyond that. Yeah, next time I think I'll go back and get another 510 instead. So... I guess it's still a decent buy if you get cheaply and don't use voice dialing.

"I live in the country with a weak cell signal. I mounted the external antenna very high (second floor porch) where the signal is usually one to two bars. The unit sits in our den which has open access to several rooms. When standing a foot from the unit, the signal strength is a solid four bars. Step a few feet away and it drops to two. Go in another room and it drops to one bar and sometimes zero. I have had calls dropped due to signal fade while in the next room.

"I've had this product for a month and love it. Very good sound quality for both sides of the call. Volume is loud enough that I can hear with no problem and the people on the receiving end have told me that the volume tends to be a little on the loud side...so there is no need to ""elevate"" your voice like you do with many speakerphones. You can ""press and hold"" the button for about 3 seconds and it will activate the voice dial feature on my phone. It was super easy to sync (I have a Motorola Krzr phone). The battery life is impressive. After a month of use I have only charged it the initial time. I use it almost every day on my drive home from work (about 15 minutes) and also fairly often on the weekends. The profile is very slim so you could easily toss this into your briefcase or purse. I've been very pleased with the quality and ease of use. I highly recommend it and would definitely buy it again.",positive,positive,0.00033063113905090486,0.0009906146658710969,0.9986787541950781
"First, this is a great headset. Second, Bluetooth is horrible technology. The truth is that the headset is great but your experience depends on your phone. I have a HP IPAQ phone and it works great with all Plantronics products. With this headset, I hear no static, it answers the call instantly, and it has a range of 15 feet a without static. The sound is good and the volume is really loud. Now that being said, if I use a headset made by Motorola with my phone I have lots of problem. I have tried 4 different headsets and I always have problem with static, etc. In the end my experience is that it depends on your phone/headset combination. Trust me I have had many phones and headsets. This is a good headset regardless of the cheap price. The best part is the plastic piece fits in my ear canal, which makes it a lot easier to hear the other person. The only negative is this headset picks up a lot of extra noise.

Anywhere else in our city - 4 or 5 bars, inside our house, less than 1 bar, dropped calls, static, etc. If it hadn't been that most of our friends and family are on Verizon, and that other service providers have worse service nationwide, we would have dropped long ago.

"PMK 5800 cannot be used in populated areas. The product is designed and engineered very well. I think this is a very clever idea. Its dimensions fit my car (Audi A4 2006) perfectly. Nice lighted controls, easy setup. PMK 5800 picked up my AT&T Tilt voice recognition with no additional setup. However, there is a fatal problem in this design - you cannot use it in populated areas with lots of FM stations. I live 60 miles from Boston. Every odd FM channel here is taken. Even channels in between deliver a lot of interference from surrounding odd channels. No matter what you do - you cannot beat the FM environment around you. PMK 5800 has a weak FM transmitter so the better audio system you have the less chance you get any recognizable sound out of PMK 5800. It delivers an overwhelming background noise. Forget MP3 music playback. Simple design change could alter the future of this product - ability to output through its already existent mini USB port.

"After using this phone for about a week, I have come to the conclusion that the engineers spent 100 hours making it a great and pretty PDA, but about 10 minutes making the phone user friendly. The good: 1. Looks very slick, trendy, and futuristic. The keyboard rolling out is definitely a convo starter and gets people's attention. 2. You can either tap the screen with your finger or use the stylus. 3. Came with stereo earpiece. This also allows you to upload your MP3's and listen to them without purchasing any extra equipment. 4. When you connect your phone to your computer through USB, it charges the battery. The BAD: 1. You turn off your phone's ringer to go to sleep. You try and set the alarm for 8 am. The phone warns you: ""The Alarm will not be audible with the phone on silent. Do you wish to continue""? Why yes, because a soundless alarm will do wonders to wake me up. EDIT: I have gotten around this issue by installing ""AlarmToday."" This app has many great features, but the best is the Calendar's Reminder (not Alarm) ability to ""overwrite"" system sound. This way, you can have a Reminder go off even when the phone is on silent. 2. You are entering a new contact's information; first of all you have to scroll to the 10th field to even get to the mobile number field. Then when you start typing, the phone is not smart enough to recognize that instead of typing ""R"" it should be typing 4. You can't have letters in a phone number, hello!? 3. The amount of ringtones, and the quality of ringtones would rate a 2/5. hey are very short, annoying, and not catchy. 4. Pulling out the keyboard SHOULD automaticaly get it to light up, so you can see it at night, but it doesn't. You then have to blindly press a key, not knowing the consequences. 5. Battery life is very short. Barely 2 day's worth of usage. 6. The camera sucks. Oh my g-d, does it suck. The pictures taken indoors are blurry, grainy, and you will be deleting most of them. I work in Quality Assurance, and there is NO WAY, I would have let this phone ship. Especially considering some of the other issues people are having below.

"I have only used for a couple of days. My application is with a Samsung A640 phone. In the car, I simply had to turn the volume up two steps to overcome the ambient noise. The audio quality seemed equivalent to my phone. With the headset in my right ear, I tried positioning the phone in my left pants pocket, my shirt pocket, and the center console. There was no perceived degradation in the quality of the signal. At home, I pushed the distance limits a bit more. While charging my phone, I walked to different parts of the house. Sound quality was acceptable until I was about 20 feet away with a wall in-between. I never lost the signal, but it crackled a bit. My previous headset was a wired Jabra with the ear gels. While Jabra does not advertise such, I found that the ear gel fits reasonably well onto the BT2010 earpiece. I liked using the ear gel better than the over-the-ear clip. Your head may vary. I wore the headset this way for over 6 hours, which is probably the limit for my comfort. This a very light-weight, simple, inexpensive, and effective solution for somebody that just wants to turn it on and go.

"I recently was very curious based on the 'on' and 'off' reviews of this headset. The most vital part about having this headset is to replace the eargels with some high end ones. Thats all you need. I am professional musician and read another review stating to get the Etymotic ER6i eargels and stretching them on to fit. It made a DRAMATIC difference in the tonality of this stereo bluetooth.

For 9 dollars more to buy a 5 pack of those right here on Amazon, to get better sound quality I found it completely worth it, especially with a price just under 32 dollars for this headset.

"OK, this thing is the highest rated bluetooth handsfree and cell phone accessory on Amazon for good reasons. I've owned mine now for about six months and have loved every minute of it. I was going to buy a Jabra bt250 for my Motorola v360 (I bought one of those for my wife) but read these reviews and I'm glad I did. I talked to a friend of mine after I placed the order and he said that his wife has one and that she loved it. Alright, I really like the whole pros and cons review format that people use so I'll use it here too. Pros: -It is very comfortable. My first bluetooth was a Jabra bt130 and was very uncomfortable; this was a welcome relief! -Different fitting options. It comes with a few different ear pieces so you can choose the best fit. I was able to find one that fits quite well. I was wishing that it would have come with some of the gel ear pieces like my wifes has but it does the job well enough without them. -The sound quality (on both ends) is very good. One problem I had with my Jabra was I could never quite ear what people were saying. No problems with this one! Actually, I have to turn down the volume sometimes because I can hear my screaming daughter a little too well! :) I never have any problems about people hearing me either. -Fits quite securely against your head. This headset proves that comfort and fit are NOT mutually exclusive. So why did I rate this a four? Read on... Cons: -The power button is a bit small. The work around that I do with this is I turn the thing on and off while I am not wearing (a common work around for this thing, so I've read). -It drops the connection every once in a while. This gets a bit annoying at times but fortunately doesn't happen very often. -Doesn't support bluetooth version 2.0 or a2dp (stereo bluetooth). This really isn't an issue for me, though, as my phone doesn't support either of those standards anyway. -Talk time is a bit low compared to some other headsets but it still isn't bad. -It acts like it's not connected sometimes even though it is. Let me explain; I pick up the handsfree and dial a number. My phone says that I've connected to the person BUT I can't hear them and they can't hear me! Also annoying; thankfully, again, this doesn't happen very often and seems only to happen when it's been connected for a while. All of that being said; I love it! I don't regret buying it and my wife wants one now! It will definitely be worth the money you pay for it.",positive,neutral,0.02187732656548243,0.4933279185293856,0.48479475490513196

"Since it is now illegal to drive around while operating a phone, it's an alternative to using an earpiece, I have not much success with a couple different earpieces. Overall it works good, but sometimes difficult to hear some people talk (too soft). I think it depends on the others' phones and how loud they are talking. Sometimes others will hear an echo. I had no problems with the phone downloading all my numbers and names and the ST3 does a good job in saying the persons' names, so I like that feature a lot. Since I have had problems with most of my earpieces sitting in my ear comfortably, I like that it just sits on the visor. And when I put my visor down, I slide the unit around easily (it's on magnets). Since half stars aren't given, I'd give this a 3.5 star rating or a little higher, but not quite a 4. We'll see if it can withstand the test of time, heat from being in the armrest storage during the days and can continue to operate properly.",neutral,neutral,0.018667416853813002,0.5738484290289577,0.40748415411722927
"I've been a sprint customer for over three years and have owned three sanyo phones; Sanyo 8100, Sanyo 8300, and the Kantana. If you're coming from a mulitimedia phone like the Sanyo 8300, the SCP-6600 Katana may be a bit of a disappointment to you. The Katana just doesn't have all of the bells and whistles as a multimedia phone. The Katana has no built in flash which is needed for taking half decent pictures with a camera phone. It also has no camcorder or media player. But then again its not suppose to. It's basically an attempt by sprint and Sanyo to satisfy the consumer cravings for the popular RAZR phones that are available through wireless carriers like Cingular, Verizon Wireless, T-Mobile, Cricket and a few others. It's obvious by looking at the Katana that it was inspire by the Razr, which does not have MM functions either. On a feature note I would have to give the Katana a one besides doing the simple things like making phone calls and downloading ringers and screen savers there's just not much more you can do on it. Aesthetically the Katana is not that much of a beaut. However, it is for the time being a bit different looking so for (except when compared to the RAZR) that I'd give it a four. For the lack of a decent camera and camcorder I have to deduct two more points which brings rating down to three stars.

"I received this for Christmas and was thrilled. It fits well, and enabled nicely with my Samsung Sync. However, that's where the fun ended. I cannot be more than 3 feet away from the phone or it becomes very static-y and drops calls. The distance between my purse in a shopping cart (where my phone is) and me pushing the cart is too far. If its on my lap or in my pocket its fine. But as soon as I cross that 3 foot distance mark, it breaks up so badly I cannot understand what others are saying. They can still hear me just fine--but I cannot hear them. Now about the fit. I work as a customer service rep out of my home, so I wear a headset pretty much the whole day. This one is comfortable--for about an hour. Then my ear starts to ache. I don't have that problem with higher quality headsets. I am returning this to try a Motorola.

"I was a little surprised to see that the average review is about 3 stars. I was expecting better scores. I think it's a decent phone, just lacking some modern features. There's no MP3 player, no camera (most cell phone cameras are pretty bad anyway), and there's no speakerphone (though it's a bluetooth phone, so I wouldn't use that anyway, I don't get it). Voice quality over the phone is very good, about on the same level as my old Kyocera K9, which I'm told is one of the best sounding phones. Ringtones are loud enough that I can actually hear them. It is a decent-looking phone, although a bit boring for some, I guess. It has held up well, and is still 100% functional even after being dropped a few times, and having been bumped into things all the time. Service? I've kept my Virgin Mobile service for a few years now. I don't use my phone all that much, so the $15/90 days I believe is still the cheapest available, and it works great for me. I do lose reception in steel buildings, but they all do that. I've never had a dropped call, or missed a call due to not having a signal. I wish the phone had more notepad memory. After you have 10 or 15 notes, it won't let you create any more, even if there's lots of memory left on the phone. I don't like any of the ringtones or text-tones that come loaded in the phone, and the games loaded on the phone are only trial versions. So it cost me $13, I think, to download a ringtone I like, and add a couple games to keep me occupied if get stuck waiting. I was actually shopping to replace the Flare, but it sounds like the X-TC is too limited, and the other phones are mostly the same, except that some have cameras. I'll just stick with what I have for a while longer. UPDATE, 7/22/12: I'm not sure what's going on, but the phone started to drain the battery within 16 hours about a month ago. I replaced the phone with a Samsung M575, and I've had the Flare in airplane mode for a few weeks without a charge.

"I traded my VX6000 for this phone. This phone has been getting fairly bad reviews across the board stemming from the lack of bluetooth support from Verizons end. People think that you cannot get information to and from the phone other than emailing back and forth, but they are wrong. I bought a 128MB transflash card and a SD reader for 40 bucks total. I don't have anything that can send Bluetooth signals anyway, so the fact that I had to buy a separate reader wasn't an issue. I can send pictures and ringtones to and from the phone without Verizon charging me. The only problem with MP3 ringtones is that you have to save them to the phones internal memory, so you have to chop them down and lower the quality to keep more than a few. The transflash card itself is worth the extra cost of this phone. I can grab pictures off the computer to use as wallpaper or as a contact ID, again for free. The camera is more worthless than my VX6000 indoors, but outside it takes fairly decent pictures.

"i was mildly excited to get this new phone after losing my lg vx6000, which i really liked. i liked the lg vx6000 because of its convenient camera, its ability to have mp3 ringtones (via some easyhacks), its ability to sync via bitpim (a great tool, look it up on the web!), and its decently small size. when i upgraded to the v710, my first hesitation was its ginormous (enormous) size. it's bigger than motorola's old star tac line, which for the better half of a decade set the golden standard. compared to the lg vx6000, this motorola v710 is a big, big, clunker, the land yacht of modern cell phones. one _might_ think that my concern about the size is all image-based; but no, the size creates serious problems. for one thing, the phone is heavy and easily falls off whatever its clipped to (belt, bag, etc.) because of its weight and its clumsy holster. secondly, the giant size makes the phone get in the way of daily activities. this phone ought to be as slim as motorola's razr v3 phone. originally, i was pretty excited to get a 1.2 mp camera and a camcorder. of course, i think this imaging chip is a cmos not a ccd, which is a negative, but one i'm willing to accept for the sake of size and price. however, when you first take the phone out of the box, you will have the ultimate problem of figuring out how to transfer the photos and videos off your phone to your computer. it seems that verizon tries to trap you into using their extremely overpriced pixplace service. at 25 cents an upload, you can easily rack up a bill as enormous as this phone's body. what's the use in owning a digital camera, if you need to pay in order to retrieve your pictures? that's like owning a film camera! it appears that originally, we were supposed to transfer our pictures via this phone's nice bluetooth functionality. however, what i'm hearing is that verizon purposely dumbed down this phone's bluetooth functionality in order to armbar us into using their expensive (and inconvenient) data transfer services. after all, we should've been able to transfer mp3s to our motorola v710 phones via bluetooth in order to use them as ringtones or with the built-in mp3 player. the only way to get around this data transfer dilemma is to buy the moderately priced transflash ram card. sandisk makes a nice 256mb transflash ram card, which has greatly improved my relationship with this phone. it's feels more like a quick fix than an ideal solution, which would be a wireless or even wired connection direct to my computer. (in fact, earlier, i had purchased a motorola data cable for this phone; but without the expensive software and without the time to implement the hack software, it was of little use to me.) my disappointment over the bluetooth functionality doesn't stop there. i am indeed upset that i can't transfer files to my computer via the bluetooth connection but am further unhappy that i cannot interface the phone via bluetooth with my palmone tungsten t5. one would expect that i could use the pda's phonebook from my phone via the wireless connection. from what i'm hearing, one of the few things this bluetooth i/o is good for is one of those expensive wireless handsfree kits. luckily, the phone has a built-in speakerphone that provides a good handsfree solution, one of this phone's only positives. i do enjoy the camera with somewhat satisfactory flash and the camcorder. the still images come out nice at 1.2 mp, admittedly better than the pictures from my old lg vx6000. i also enjoy the self-portrait mode, where you close the lid and use the _outside_ screen as the viewfinder. (this could function as a makeshift mirror if needed.) the biggest negative about the camcorder is that the video is stored in this awkward .3g2 (3gpp) format, which is incompatible with windows media player and seems only to work with apple quicktime. it seems that verizon is pushing its customers to upgrade from lg vx6000 phones to these motorola v710 phones. it _is_ a natural evolution from small still pics to video clips. however, verizon's definitely taken this opportunity to attempt to foil the gadget guru crowd, which previously enjoyed hacks for free wireless web and the like. considering that customers will find they need to buy more of verizon's services in order to use this phone verizon ought to be paying the customers to switch to this phone. perhaps, the closest we'll get to that situation is a free-after-rebate deal.",negative,neutral,0.024134891812483617,0.7033102053311338,0.27255490285638273

"The defender case for your iPhone 3G is quite possibly the best case on the market. In this review I will address issues brought to light by other reviewers as well as detailing why it is I believe the Defender by Otterbox is the only logical solution on the market. The case is in three pieces which makes the overall phone larger than most phones on the market. The iPhone also happens to be one of the most expensive phones on the market - if you believe there may be a potential accident in which you drop your investment, then protection is what is key. The bulk directly translates to superior protection. While not completely waterproof, the case does protect against rain and moisture - I just wouldn't go swimming with it. A previous review mentions that the phone will fall out of the belt clip, claiming that you may not be able to hear the phone if it were to fall. Either that customer had a fluke of a clip or they weren't placing it into the clip properly (which is my bet). The clip connects the phone in no fewer than four locations, providing ample connectivity for active people. I work in the film industry, climbing ladders, running around, constructing sets, and cutting lumber - the phone has not fallen from the holster once. The issue with docking is a valid concern, but considering there are many other ways to charge your phone (via the included USB adapter to connect either to your computer or using a wall socket) I feel this argument is trivial, close-minded and moot. The only people I would not recommend the Otterbox Defender 3G case are those individuals who have owned and operated an iPhone for a considerable amount of time prior to purchasing the case. The case does add considerable mass the your phone, and as such, if you've already adapted to using your phone in its slimmer profile, you may get annoyed at the added girth. If, however, you have just recently purchased an iPhone, or are planning on buying one soon - do not hesitate your purchase. The Otterbox Defender is the only case of the market that fulfills the purpose of a phone case: protection.",positive,neutral,0.06075589695738932,0.7815183807441377,0.157725722298473

"$50 at Costco, I figured worth a try. I hate it when I'm working around the yard and my headphone wire gets caught on the weedeater, lawnmower, whatever - a real drag. My son has the first edition LG Tone [It's on the 3rd edition now, Tone+ has improved audio but awful BT connectivity, jury is out on just released Tone Pro] and I may try one of those next. Comes with a Quick Start Guide, which gives easy pairing and connecting instructions and also the basics of controls and operation. Guess what? If you want to full manual - it doesn't exist! No kidding. I searched all over the Motorola site and the quick start guide is all that's available. So for example if you changed the EQ from the default (which I assume to be flat) and hear the unnecessary voice, ""EQ changed!"" you may wonder -changed to what? What are the EQ presets? You'll never find out, that info is apparently classified. Sound is OK but not impressive. Plenty of bass and no obvious lacking in the upper mids and highs, but no ""Oh, yeah!"" factor - which I suppose is not to be expected from such an inexpensive rig. No big Con there. [Disclaimer: last summer I scored a Bose QC15 set off you-know-what at an insanely cheap price, for my flights to Japan. Then when I got back I flipped it and made $100 profit. Heck with that, should have kept it. Best sound I ever heard, as expected from a (retail) $250 set. Sold 'em. Dumb.] They are very lightweight and comfortable, but the earbud cables are a bit too short - they pull when I turn my head. The pilot (on-off) light is a tiny and dim blue LED that's impossible to view in sunlight; you have to cup your hands over it with your face close up to see if it's turning on or off. Then recently they refused to connect with my phone unless I un-and re- paired them. And that led to the headset being returned, unacceptable.",neutral,negative,0.5784554427651527,0.3662661246594126,0.0552784325754347
"Update 2/10: Updated and streamlined review after a couple of ""unhelpful"" votes from reviewers... Please read my updates! Still using these, and they work well. Also found the Samsung WEP650 with a $[...] rebate on a $[...] purchase price on [...]. Generally a fan of the Samsung Bluetooths - good value for the money, and the sound is at least as good as the Motorola, BlueAnt, and Jabra I've had. Update 11/09: I'd lower my rating to 4 stars if I could - still great value for the money, but found a few problems, notably that the ear loops break easily. I was forced to switch to Jabra ear gels. PROS: + small + easy to charge + long talk time + stays on ear well with the ear loop or a jabra gel (which you can also order on Amazon) + great sound CONS: - ear loop breaks quickly; I switched to jabra ear gels which work well. - can be choppy if you don't talk clearly or if you are outside, walking or it is windy - Is not a multi-phone bluetooth. If you use two phones (say work/personal), look elsewhere. I bought the WEP 700 and two WEP 200's for $[...], after rebeate (Samsung runs rebates often). I am happy all in all. After using $50-100 bluetooth headsets and considering a BlueAnt (for $[...]), I instead have three headsets for my family for the sum of $[...] and they work wonderfully. The WEP 700 is better vs. the WEP 200 - easier to charge, better ear attachment than the WEP 200 (that doesn't break), and doesn't require the small ""charger box"" to charge. Don't even bother with the 300 and 500 series - they have a lot of problems based on the reviews I have read.",positive,neutral,0.018359785697184775,0.7781039183135948,0.2035362959892204

"At least I got all the pieces to this one, as the last one I got was missing the antenna and I had to ship it back. I set this up in my office, and got the green LED, acknowledging the unit was powered up. Put my LG G4 in the cradle and saw no change in the reception bars. Pulled up the dB meter in the phone setting and after several rounds of testing determined that the booster was having no effect at all , a 0dB gain in signal strength under any conditions. Just to make sure the booster was defective, I brought in an older Wilson Electronics Sleek that I have been using successfully in my home for a few years now. I used the weBoost antenna with the older cradle and it worked great, 8-12dB of gain without even fussing with it. I also noted that this thing got very warm, almost hot. My older Wilson Electronics Sleek has never been anything but room temperature . I was already a bit leery when I saw the company had changed its name, as this rarely if ever spells an improved product from any entity.

"Well, this covering looks nice, and it helps keep fingerprints off the case, but that's about it. As you can see from the photo, it does not cover the screen or the keypad. Initially I thought that was a good thing because I want to see those things - right? Well when the phone is not in use, you want the screen to be fully covered to protect it from things. Also, the keypad gets grungy pretty quickly in pockets and purses, and it's hard to dust off, so it's good to have that covered as well. My other issue with this case is that after a few weeks, it started to tear at a weak spot. You see how it's got all the little openings cut out so you can get to the various buttons and stuff? That leaves a few spots where the silicon is very very thin, and apparently it's easy for it to start to tear. My advice is to get a leather case, the sort that flips closed over the phone.

I can hear the conversation in the head set perfectly though. In my girlfriend's VW Passat the cabin is quiet enough that the headset works beautifully.

"I like parts of the phone, but the flaws are so large, I wish I bought a different one. I'm not a fancy text-messenger or want all these super features, I just want a phone that's easy to use, that has a clock, and can do the occasional photo or text message. What I do like: 1. I like the inside layout/buttons. The buttons on the inside of the phone are easy to see, easy to press. 2. Nice bright display inside. 3. Clock display on the outside panel. What I don't like: 1. The stupid design of putting buttons on the side of the phone. You can't pick it up or hold it without pressing these buttons. I'm constantly changing the volume accidentally or turning on the camera - and then I have to change the volume back and turn off the camera. What a poor design choice. 2. The battery life. If you don't use the phone (like if it is just sitting on your desk), it is great. It lasts a long time. But if you actually talk on the phone, it drains the battery like crazy. I brought it with me when I went into labor. After the birth, it was doing fine. Full battery charge (according to the meter) but it was solid dead after a 1-2 hour conversation with my sister. 3. Not sure what I did, but the covering on the lens for the camera was cracked pretty immediately. I had my old Nokia bar phone for 2 years and it never cracked. Maybe it was something I did, or maybe this one is not as durable. Anyway, it works fine.

"I have extensive experience using portable batteries for my Iphones and Ipads over the last 5 years. This model looks and feels great cosmetically.

I have to manually remember to shut it down, although it probably uses extremely low power when on but not charging anything. The USB holds cables in a well sturdy way. I can let the battery dangle by itself at the end of a USB cable while holding an Iphone without the battery falling off. Very useful when leaving it in a bag/purse that it will not disconnect when shuffling around. My first power test showed a weak result, but I think that is not unusal for the first 1-2 times you charge most portable batteries.

"This inexpensive little ""Switcheasy"" clip looked like a promising solution to holding the Nike plus sensor onto your shoe if, like me, you prefer running shoes other than Nikes with the built-in sensor pocket (I am a big fan of Asics Gel Kayanos). In fact, I bought two ""clear"" clips. I have a different pouch that laces onto my shoes, but it's hard to remove since you've got to unlace the shoe completely, so I thought this clip would give me an easy way to change between walking, running, hiking shoes etc. It IS very easy to switch. The problem is, it's too easy: it falls off. A lot. I read the directions and carefully tried to ""lock"" it onto my laces. But I lost two separate sensors...one while walking in my neighborhood and the other while on a cruise ship deck. I was always picking it up after it fell off around the house or on the street. I do walk a mile or two almost daily, but I'm hardly a ""power user""...I don't run much and I'm not hiking in the backwoods. THe clips are not expensive, but the Nike plus sensors in the sport kit or with the new Nike plus sportsband aren't cheap. It just doesn't make sense to use this clip and risk losing the sensor. The best choice: the velcro-driven Marware sportsuit sensor case, currently on Amazon at $9.99. Velcros right onto your shoe laces. Easy, secure. And no, I don't work for Marware. There is always some slight accuracy loss with all these clips, but they make so much sense because they allow flexibility with your workout shoe purchase AND what particular shoes you want to wear that day -- especially important if you wear waterproof/cleat walking shoes in the rain and ice.",negative,positive,0.041826696982377634,0.3030481715458029,0.6551251314718195

I've had this for at least 6 months now and I use it every day but I did not realize it was an outdated model when I bought it. Windows 8 will not recognize the phone or the software on the CD so none of the software or Outlook sync functions work. The phone discharges very fast and if you have the phone on charger and try to use the headset you better not go much beyond the room the phone is in or everything turns to static.

"My brother actually upgraded his line on our account and selected this phone. He got it for around 30 bucks and said nothing but great things. After discovering it was a touch screen and playing with it for a couple of minutes, I wanted one, so I upgraded my line, too. I'm a HUGE texter. I'll send out 5000+ texts a month easy. I was excited that this phone had both the regular keyboard with predictive texting as well as the QWERTY keyboard. That is until I discovered that the QWERTY keyboard is QWERTY crappy... which is okay because I type faster using predictive text anyway. So I changed my settings to use predictive text every time I send a message, right? Apparently not. First problem I had with this phone was when I discovered that it would random revert back to standard text and I'd have to manually change the settings back to T9. Angered me every single time I had to do it. It stopped for a while, but eventually always does it again. With that in mind, somewhere around the 1 month mark, the touch screen pooped out on me. I would touch a 1 and it'd think I was touching a 9. There was nothing I could do, no recalibration could restore the accuracy. VERY difficult to text, let alone actually dial a number. Phone was practically useless with the exception of answering calls. Next thing I know... my battery, which wasn't good to begin with, is completely shot. After about 3 months of service, my battery will NOT hold a charge. It'll work long enough for me to answer a call, but as soon as I hear ""hello,"" it's gone. Had to replace the battery. New battery is almost as bad. Speaking of the battery, the charge cord is TERRIBLE! I've gone through three. The cheap design is just so easy to break and I'm very gentle on my phones. It doesn't even stay firmly pressed into the phone anymore and I have to angle it just to get it to charge. In addition to these fatal flaws, the browswer sucks. I took my data package off because it was torture to try to use the internet on the phone. Many of my calls go straight to voice mail. The phone has absolutely no storage whatsoever. Did I mention the headset jack? How about the bluetooth? Oh, wait... the former is missing in action and the latter has never worked.

"This is a truly lovely wireless phone with excellent comfort, portability, range and noise cancellation. I've been using it for several months in a very noisy server room environment. Having gone through multiple supposedly ""noise canceling"" phones, this is the first one that really passed muster with customers. I had been using this on my standard phone line and integrated it with my laptop's Outlook directory. Simple, easy and excellent! Within 5 minutes I had 200 contacts loaded onto the phone. It's nice that you can manually edit the phone numbers and contact information before they're loaded onto the phone so you don't wind up with extraneous data. I just switched over to using VOIP instead of a phone line, and decided to use this with my Mac instead of Windows. Honestly, it's not so good. Unlike other phones that are specifically designed to be VOIP phones, you can't dial the phone through the handset anymore - you have to use the softphone. You can answer and disconnect calls, but that's all. The software for the Mac is not as mature as it is for the PC, either. The Calisto Pro utility for the Mac frequently loses connectivity to the Mac and doesn't show up in the utility bar that it's lost its connection. So, you'll be dialing away through the softphone only to hear your party answering - and you're not audible. It's not a very professional image to present if you're using this for work, as I do. So far, the software for Windows is more reliable. No matter which operating system - once you have a successful connection, sound quality is excellent. The earpiece is very comfortable and the device has wonderful range. I'd like to see Plantronics improve the quality, reliability and feature set of the VOIP offering for this device.

"The reception between this model and my Treo 650 has been one of the better I've experienced with a Bluetooth headset. Keeping the Treo close, or on the same side of your body is helpful, & I just put the phone in the little well in front of my gearshift in my car. If I have to take a call, I take less risk of wrapping my car around a tree like some idiot going 75 with a phone up to his head, and the reception stays clear. It took me reading the instructions (go figure)to master all of the functions that one button controls, but that seemed to clear up EVERY issue I had with it either NOT answering, or hanging up etc, that others have complained about in previous reviews. My mother actually admits to hearing everything I've said, a change from previous headsets where everyone kept complaining they couldn't hear me (how convenient). So, all in all, the best Bluetooth I've had yet with my Treo 650. Why not a 5th star? Well, it's the hinge that it hangs from. It's not painful as other devices have been, but it's almost too flexible, and unless you get it just right, the device can start to sag off of your ear.

My problem is that although it works, there is almost no guidelines for creting ringtones. I found an article online that explained how to create ringtones for my wife's phone. I couldn't believe after buying this package that all it offered for an explanation was a vague error message when you tried to load an MP3 that wasn't sampled correctly. I have it working now, but as a professional programmer I must say that a typical low-level user would never get personalized ringtones loaded on the phone. This is unacceptable; since I know programmically it isn't all that hard to do the resample on the fly. Motorola didn't do this, I believe, to drive the typical user into buying ringtones out of the confusion of how to create them.

"After reading several good reviews on the H610 I decided to purchase as I am living in Italy and roads are difficult at best to navigate. I knew it came with US maps loaded but wrongly assumed it would be an easy thing to get the Euro maps. After I checked their website, they said ""maybe"" they would have the maps ready by spring 2007. This was baffling to me that a GPS would be released with all these ""world traveler"" features like currency/temp conversion, etc. and not have world maps available. Besides that, the user manual can only be accessed through the CD, which can be frustrating when you are looking for how to do something. The tiny booklet that came with explained almost nothing. I still am not sure what the M button on the side was for, other than the fact that it kept getting stuck down and would make the MIO boot in some sort of maintenance mode. Finally, I was not impressed with the look. The screen is just too small and cannot be changed to horizontal (or at least not easily because I could not figure it out). Also, the color and wrist strap that come with the thing have a decidedly feminine look to them and then I found some websites where the thing is advertised as ""GPS for Ladies"". You can imagine how much fun my coworkers had with me when they saw that. All this added up to me returning the product for a refund. Regarding the GPS features, it seemed to hold a signal well and play all the multimedia junk fine, but the negatives far outweighed the positives.",neutral,neutral,0.09468073802779711,0.8514473342357749,0.053871927736428016

"PROS: Works probably as well as it can as designed. Does route to a destination as programmed. CONS: Unfortunately, for this unit, it was purchased after I had used a TomTom One for 6 months.

On first use, the Garmin routed me to a warehouse instead of a retail store and then routed me to a store in another town when trying to go to a different store that had existed for years in the city I was in.

"Appearance/Design: Overall a great design for the device. Nice miniature size that fits into my backpack's smallest compartments or even snugly into my jacket or jeans pockets if necessary.

Features: The flashlight is nice, it projects light at a reasonable distance and illuminates objects nicely. The laser pointer features is an awesome addition, perfect for helping with a presentation or just having fun. It also sits nicely and feels ergonomic for my grip, which makes it great for presentations. Charging: It took about 2 hours for the charger to charge up my Galaxy SIII from 20% to 90% (at that point the charger lost about half of its storage). In another test, my Galaxy SIII charged from 24% to 85% in a little under 2 hours. This is fast enough for my uses.

"I've owned the i730 for about 2 weeks, having bought it to ""upgrade"" the i90c I've used for over a year. The i90c was a fine phone, a bit bulky and the batter life was terrible (even with an upgraded 750mAh battery), but it's incredible call clarity and loud speakerphone was enough to make me overlook its shortcomings. So, I figured the i730 would only be better than i90c, right? Not necessarily. My biggest complaint with the i90c was battery life, and sadly, Motorola still hasn't solved the problem. The i730 is a slight improvement, but if you use the phone a lot like I do, be prepared with car chargers and backup batteries. The i90c was also bulky as it had a hump on the back to accomodate the battery. While the 730 is sleek (no hump), it still is essentially the same size and thickness as the i90. Weight is nearly identical. Call clarity with the i730 is comparable to the i90c, which is good. Speakerphone, here's my biggest complaint. With the i730, Motorola moved the speakerphone to the back of the phone (it faced the front on the i90c). This makes no sense to me. Others have said they like this design because they can hear people when the phone is clipped to their belt, but when I use the speakerphone, I generally place the phone down on a surface. As a result, the sound is muffled coming from the speakerphone. Another complaint is the location of the buttons. First, the power button is nestled between other important buttons and is not easily found in the dark (unlike the i90c). Call and end buttons are also reversed from the i90c. While I'm sure with enough use I'll get familiar with the location, the reversal of buttons from the 90/95 models has me frustrated. There are good things I like about the i730, such as the flip activation control, which allows me to place a call on speakerphone and close the phone without disconnecting. I also like the clean appearance (silver), and the blue backlight makes using it at night easy. In sum, it's a decent phone, but coming from the i90c, I expected better considering the hefty price tag.",neutral,neutral,0.041706902662748645,0.7225131607499565,0.23577993658729468

This looks and works beautifully in my Impala. It includes screws and velcro depending on how permanent you want it. I went ahead and put it in the right way.

"I've had two of these (one for me, one for the wife) for about two months now, and we both really like the phones. They are slick looking, for one thing, but actually work well in pretty much every aspect as well. Reception has been stellar, no dropped called (even in areas where I know the signal is weak and where our old phones would drop the call). Talking is clear and we haven't experienced any of the echo issues others have mentioned. Basically, for simple phone purposes it has worked flawlessly. It's got a camera, we rarely use this feature. It's a low resolution and we don't have much use for it, but it's gotta be there nowadays. Web functionality is as good as any small, non-PDA type phone. Again, we don't really use this feature much. My biggest surprise, and I'm thrilled with it, is the music player. My old Motorola had a wannabe mp3 player, but it was severely limited. This little phone has a better music then my Creative Zen in some aspects. It's easy to load and organize, and sound is awesome. The only complaint is that the volume is digital and the level between 4 and 5 is to different...one isn't quite loud enough and the other is too loud. All in all, I can't find anything bad to say about this phone, other then short battery life. It really only lasts a couple of hours of use, so that's a little low. Other then that, I'd highly recommend it.",positive,positive,0.002582426102604485,0.03543778646723807,0.9619797874301576

Cons: - ECHO ECHO ECHO... Everyone I talked to (on landlines and cell phones) complained about the echo. I had to turn the volume almost off before they stopped hearing it, then I could not hear them... - Volume is terrible. Even at full volume it is difficult to hear the other person. Forget using it in the car or in a noisy environment. - Fits the ear very loosely and feels like it is going to fall off. The earpiece tends to move around and get out of position with any head movement.

The phone is fine. I've purchased many items from Amazon over the years and am one of their biggest fans. On this purchase however I had to go through a vendor ( Ace Digital ) and cannot recommend them. Phone came quickly but it became evident it had been used before ( issues with memory stick for one ). Also needed to purchase separately at Radio Shack a charger adapter as the one included with the w800i ( i for international ) is for European use only! Amazon does not involve itself with third party vendors (understood) but our two phone conversations with Ace Digital in Brooklyn were unpleasant to say the least. Very rude and uncooperative.

"I bought these for my iPhone today. The Good: - I like the format and the size. - I like the deep bass that only comes from headphones with large drivers. - The technical features are good (iPod track controls, phone toggle, volume). The Bad: - The hard over-ear plastic thing that hangs on your ears was far too rigid and really began to hurt after about 30 minutes of use. - Sound quality is not very good. Bass is good, but high frequencies are trashed, most likely by the Bluetooth compression. Chances are the headphones themselves can reproduce music well, but the radio transmission process is creating noticeable distortion and garbage in the high freqs. In summary, had I bought these just for use with phone conversations, I probably would choose to keep them. But they promise good music listening (and now I want that!)

"This was my first bluetooth headset. I love the fact that you could just close/open the boom to turn it off and on! I also liked that you could charge it from any Micro USB cable. It was rather flimsy feeling on my ear though, and felt if I spun my head too fast it would come off. I also had a hard time hearing the person on the other end because of the poor connection it made with my ear (or maybe I'm just spoiled by the ear bud gel tip on my Plantronics 975 now!). This would have gotten four stars, but about four months in to having it the microphone out of nowhere stopped functioning. Literally one call it was fine, but the next one less than a minutes later it was no good. It never worked again. The only thing keeping it at three stars was the incredible battery life.

"I bought this headset because it will connect to a computer and thusly can be used for Skype. Supposedly, many Bluetooth headsets can accomplish this task, but of the three we had in the house, none could (apparently, the headset must be capable of entering ""discovery"" mode to tie-in with a computer, versus just ""pairing mode""). So, I did a little research, and this is one of the Bluetooth headsets that can DEFINITELY work with a computer. And that much is true; the Audio 920 can connect to a computer, and quite effortlessly in fact. I have a G5 iMac (with iSight), which already has Bluetooth built-in. After charging the A920 and putting in into ""discovery"" mode, I had no problem finding it with my Mac and making a connection. Other than the fact that it will connect to a computer without hassle, I have nothing positive to say about this device. First and foremost, the sound and mic quality compared to a computer is HORRENDOUS. When my Mac made system sounds, they sounded horrible horrible horrible. Five-dollar headphones will reproduce beeps and blurps with more fidelity. More importantly, and worst still, was the quality of Skype conversations. I am new to Bluetooth, but to me it seems like a worthless technology. I tested this headset in a completely open room, and if you are anywhere but immediately next to the receiving device, there are noticeable degradations in sound-quality. In fact, about an hour into a conversation, I switched-off the headset because the other party could hardly hear me and described me as a ""robot"". I did try using the included USB Bluetooth stick, which also connects effortlessly, but it didn't really improve the sound-quality. When using the USB Bluetooth stick, I must admit that there was a slight improvement, but I also called a US landline (versus a Mexican landline), so I can't be sure which variable was more responsible for the change. The set itself is relatively nice feeling, but it would not stay in my ear and I have NEVER had that problem with an earpiece before. I wouldn't say I have an ideal ear-opening, but earpieces always work, and if anything, tend to be too big versus the A920 which is tiny. After much fiddling, I could find a sweet-spot and without much movement it would stay put. I can't imagine how this device must fit for everyone else. All in all, I DO NOT RECOMMEND the A920, at least if your plan is to use it for Skype / computer connection. For the high-price (I could only find the A920 paired with the USB Bluetooth stick, which cost $85), it's simply not worth it. The call-quality, the one area that I will not sacrifice, is poor, at best. I am apparently forced to spend at least twice as much and buy a VoIP / Skype phone because the Bluetooth option isn't adequate.",negative,negative,0.5857084802189728,0.3877674667343211,0.02652405304670602

"I bought this to replace a universal model mounted to my air vent. It came with a slim manual (normal these days... at least it was included in print). Really liked that it had an extension piece for the arm and all the parts connected by nice strong ball joints that let me position the iPhone 3GS exactly where I want it and in portrait or landscape mode. I used the suction cup mount to attach to the windshield with NO PROBLEMS what-so-ever. Didn't have to press hard when dialing down the suction cup and its never came off while driving. Its used in a Ford Escape. The problems others are having could be due to different curvatures in windshields possibly or maybe bad example shipped. Its also possible their windshields aren't clean which could also be an issue. It does come with a sticky padded disc mount should you prefer to mount to a dash instead too. The cradle for the iPhone holds it nicely. It almost snaps in place and pops out to assure its secure position. Sure it doesn't allow a case to be used but could you imagine making the cradle adapt to so many different cases? Or it would have to rely on a universally adjustable arms to hold it like my previous mount. That's more messing around when putting in and pulliing it out of the cradle and I prefer the quick pop in and out method. It also frees up the top and bottom for power charger connection and headphone jack access. Actually, you can access all the controls easily. What would make this better? Maybe add a sync connector that employs power and audio out signals that can be hard wired through back of dash. Add a nice slim hardshelled case that comes with adapter that works with case for arm sold seperately (More money Griffin! Wake up your marketing team!). Overall I highly recommend.

"It's hard to review this in a way because there are so many variables that make it worthwhile or not worthwhile, depending upon your situation, circumstances and level of expectation. All I can do is explain my circumstances and hope it helps someone. I live way out in the woods, so it's very rural. I'm surrounded by trees on all sides which block my signal considerably. So my signal has always been bad, but then I went and put a metal roof on my house. Had I known it would just about kill my signal I may not have done it, I only learned afterward that a metal roof will do that. So it was a lousy connection before the metal roof, then with the metal roof I started getting dropped calls, etc. Just a terrible experience. I had to sit in a certain place, with my head in a certain direction to talk and even then it often wouldn't work, I was constantly cutting out or getting dropped. So I did my research and decided I liked the idea of the WeBoost brand; they seemed reputable and had a fairly clear explanation of their products, various videos, etc. I would have liked the next model up, which requires installing an exterior antenna, but it wasn't practical in my circumstance. I live alone, I'm disabled, I don't have anyone to climb up to my roof to install the antenna, heck; I don't even own a tall ladder. And I can't afford to hire someone to do it either, so this model seemed more feasible without much hassle. Also, I've found that my ""best spot"" seems to change with the season, the dropping of leaves on the trees, the snow or lack of snow, etc., and I really didn't like the idea of a permanently placed antenna that's not easily adjustable. So with this model, I can move it to a different window if needed, or even change the angle slightly from inside, which I like. So I ordered the EQO model, because it's all interior and no roof mounting. I have to say, it's by far the best labeled/packaged product I've ever seen. Every part is in its own bag, labeled with a big Step 1, Step 2, etc on it. Good instructions too. Everything is very clearly spelled out and well marked. So one downside, or something to consider at least: It took A LOT of experimenting, location-wise. I spent a week or so moving it around to different windows, up high, down low, you name it. This thing is VERY touchy. The SLIGHTEST angle change can make a HUGE difference in reception, at least in my experience. So in my case (and much to my surprise) I ended up not using the little window antenna at all. That's the little part that goes between your glass and screen. It seems the boost it might have received wasn't worth the loss of signal from the extra cable, so in other words, connecting a 3rd part counter-acted the benefit. So I set that aside, set the larger antenna just inside the window (interior window sill, table near window, etc) and continued experimenting with my arrangement that way. A big challenge is that the two larger pieces (interior antenna and booster) have to face the same direction and you only have the length of the cable to work with. They also can't be too close together. Then you have to figure out which window to use, so it can be tricky. I finally learned (after a call to tech support) that the booster and the antenna should really be at very similar heights; I had the antenna in a window and the booster on top of a tall bookshelf before discovering that it was much better if I moved the booster from the top of the shelf down to the middle shelf. Also, a clear line of sight between the two components is ideal. The range being advertised as ""up to 1200 square feet"" can be VERY misleading. ""Up to"" is the key, so I'd take that with a grain of salt to be honest. Maybe if that 1200 feet is one large open space (no walls, etc) and if the outside signal is fairly strong to begin with; again, so many variables! I'm sure plenty of people do get that much coverage, but just don't count on it, that's all I'm saying. For example: My entire house is very small, 750 sq feet. So one might think this would cover my whole house, right? Nope. After doing a ridiculous amount of component acrobats and creative placement, I'm able to talk in 2 small connecting rooms, which are side by side and I have the booster right by the doorway of those two rooms, sort of splitting the 180 degree range between the rooms. But I still have no improvement in my bedroom, dining room, kitchen, bath or hall. So I basically had to decide which area was most important for a signal. I chose my office and my living room because those are the two primary places where I might use the phone. So, here's where ""expectation"" and ""variables"" both come in. Some people would be furious at this, angry that it only covers two small rooms. For me personally? I'm fairly happy. Happy enough to keep it, let's put it that way. I don't have a home phone, so I rely on my cell phone. I'm also very flexible and willing to compromise. So for me it's good, I can now talk in my office and in my living room without dropped calls and without constantly saying ""WHAT?"" ""WAIT, YOU'RE CUTTING OUT. WHAT?"". So I have to say ""hang on a minute"" if I need to get a glass of water in the kitchen. For me, that's not a big deal. For other people, that might be a big deal, we're all different. I did call their customer support, twice actually. The first time I got a very friendly girl who unfortunately didn't really know what she was talking about and seemed generally unfamiliar with this particular model. She told me several incorrect things and I found myself correcting her and reading parts of the manual to her, so that was a bit useless. I sensed I'd get better results with a different person so I called back later and got a young guy who was extremely helpful and knowledgeable. He's the one who suggested I try and put the antenna and booster at the same general height as each other, and he also told me that the slightest angle can make a big difference, so I stopped moving it from room to room and instead tried changing the angle ever so slightly before ruling out a location. He also helped me understand my dBm readings, I understood that lower is better, but I was confused by seeing multiple network types, 4G, 3G, 1X, etc with varying dBm readings for each, and wasn't sure which one I should be ""aiming for"", so to speak. He helped me a lot by saying I don't really need to worry about the 4G, if I can get the 3G in a good spot that's all I need. So that simplified my troubleshooting a lot. This may be a Verizon-specific issue by the way, I'm not sure. I ended up going from 106 (on a clear day and if I was lucky) to 120 (almost non existent signal; borderline dead zone) before the WeBoost to 88 on a good day to 98 on a bad day. Either way it's a good enough signal to talk without dropped calls and without repeating myself constantly. But again, that's only in two small rooms. Between the number of variables along with different levels of expectation by the customer, I can see how someone would be thrilled or hate it or anywhere in between. The good news however, is that you can try it and return it if it doesn't work for you. I can't stress enough however, how much of the slightest change of angle or height can change the signal strength. So if you have the patience, I suggest doing a lot of playing around with it before you decide it doesn't work. To illustrate my point, my booster is toward the front of a small table and it's perfect. If I move it to the back of that table, back only 6 or so inches, the signal decreases drastically. So it's THAT sensitive. Once I found the ""sweet spot"" I was very pleased, all things considered (woods, metal roof, rural, etc).",positive,neutral,0.05957178248326433,0.7354004912270543,0.2050277262896815

"Overall great product. Cons: Although it can pair with up to 8 phones, it can only pair with one phone at a time. So if me and my wife get in to her car, it always pairs with her and I have to go through a painful power-off,power-on,hold-button-for-x-seconds sequence. I don't understand why they can't pair it to both. I can understand only one can accept calls at any given time. May be they need two transmitters, but that is what I was really looking for. Automatic sync of address book is nice. Automatic sync of ring-tone (and use the same ring tone on the bluetooth set) is very cool. Nice to have features (In case they ever look at this) 1. The on/off isn't a simple switch to slide. Holding a button down for ""several seconds"" is irritating. That said, none of the other ones I have seen have this feature either. The battery life is good, so I just leave it on. People who park their car in garage (closer to the house I meant) will find that the device keeps paired to the phone even when the phone is inside the house. Having a simple on/off switch would have made it easier to work with this situation. 2. If this had an audio-out, it would have been perfect for vehicles that have audio/line-in in the music system.

"First the pros: It works reliably, seems to have a long battery life, withstands abuse from my 1-year old, microphone picks up my voice well Now the cons: The on/off switch is extremely difficult to press. You have to press it down and hold it down with significant force to turn it on. This is especially annoying when you put it on you ear, not realizing it's off. Then you try to turn it on w/o having to remove it from your ear, but are unable to do so since such force it required. So you have to take it off to turn it on, then put it back on your ear. This happens to me all the time. I first put it on my ear, and then realize I have to turn it on. what a pain. The earpiece does not go far enough into the ear (maybe it'll fit your ear better though). My ear is a normal average adult male ear (I think), and I really wish I could put the speaker closer to my ear hole/canal. But the way it's built the speaker ends up about a centimeter outside the entrace to my ear hole, which makes it difficult to hear in scenarios where there's background noise You have to read a memorize the user manual to understand what the bizarre series of chirps and beeps this thing produces mean. Last night I used it and it was fine. This morning, after a full charge, I put it on to do my work-related conference call. Suddenly it starts making this chirping noise. It's trying to tell me something, but I have no idea what and I need to go look it up in the manual. Of course I'm about to hop on a conference call and I don't have time. So I just have to turn it off and take the call old-style: pressing the phone to my ear. What in the world is it complaining about? It has a full charge. My phone is fully charged. The connection to my phone is working fine. It's not on mute. The volume is up. What is the world could be wrong? I guess I'll find out once I find and look it up in the manual.

"I have been a blackberry user since 2003 and this newest addition is a great upgrade to the lineup. Good size and feel. The screen is the most beautiful I have ever seen. Absolutely superb screen resolution and brightness. The Edge downloads are really fast and the email functionality is the gold standard which is what really seperates Blackberries from everyone else. They could not have made the email set-up any easier. Just enter your email address and password. That's it, the blackberry does the rest. I love how they also have set-up an individual folder for each email account besides the general message folder. People are amazed when I tell them how little I paid for it through Amazon. I ordered it with standard shipping on a Tuesday evening and had it in my hands fully operational on Friday. It took less than an hour for the battery to fully charge out of the box. This is my first time with T-Mobile but my experience has been stellar. They answer my emails promptly and when I asked a question that was beyond their capability they promptly transferred me to RIM's Blackberry support which has always been great. The tips they have given me over the phone for shortcuts and navigation tricks were awesome. This phone should satisfy any road warrior. I have read posts by others complaining about various functionality issues but these are people who either a) don't own one, b) never read the manual, or c) never called tech support to get an answer. For the record, you can delete messages en massse, type phone numbers memonically i.e. 1-800-you-idiot, view your calendar and address book while on the phone, etc.. As a phone, the reception is good and T-Mobile has great coverage. I couldn't imagine being on a call and not being able to look in my calendar or email inbox. The conference call feature works like a charm and is a great feature when you are on the go. Being able to dial a number someone sent me in a text message or email directly without having to exit message/email is fantastic. The addition of the exterior mute and extra function buttons are a welcome upgrade. What more can I can write about this great phone?

"With the hands-free law coming soon in California, I started doing research on headsets, but found that there are also speakerphones. Marvelous idea. I was not particularly excited about sticking a headset to my head. I am just not that cool. I looked all over at the different speakerphones. Some have very good reviews, but their design, in my opinion, leaves much room for improvement, both functionally and aesthetically. Then I saw the Jabra SP5050. Perfecto! Not only does it do everything the other speakerphones that I was looking at do, but it does it in a form factor that is both pleasing to the eye and very functional. Because it is so thin, I don't even notice it on my sun visor. The interior of my car is black, so it also blends in very well. Call it a stealth speakerphone. Operating it could not be more simple. The area where the speaker is also doubles as a ""mouse"" if you will. Click and hold for a few seconds to turn it on/off. Click once to answer a call. Click once to hang up. Double click to redial the last number, etc. It pairs with my phone (Blackjack II) flawlessly. The sound level, which some have complained about, is very nice. Please note that the speaker level on your phone also affects the sound level on the speakerphone, so if your phone volume is turned down, you won't get much volume out of the speakerphone. Once I realized this I had all the sound level I needed, even at highway speeds, and my car is not the quietest in the cabin. I can hear callers very well. People on the other end have given me mixed comments. At highway speeds they say you can hear the background noise, but that it is not loud nor distracting from the call. On quieter roads and a slower speeds, when my car is more quiet, I have been told they could not tell I was on a speakerphone and thought I was just talking on my phone normally. Overall a very good review, in my opinion. The full-duplexing has worked flawlessly. Both people can talk at the same time. No one is cut out while the other talks. Some speakerphones claim to have full-duplex, but I have read complaints that it does not always work. On this speakerphone it has always worked. There are only two things I would change about this speakerphone: 1) I would include a wall charger. Currently you can only charge the device in the car. I am rarely in my car long enough to get a full charge, so being able to charge it in my apartment would be nice. 2) I would change the visor clip so that you can easily remove it from the speakerphone for easy transport, like with some type of quick-release mechanism. This thing is so thin and sleek that I think it would be great to carry around with you to business meetings. It will easily fit in the pocket of your business suit. You could pull it out, connect it, and have a productive meeting with a room full of people. It could also easily be used at home so you could have a hands-free conversation, like when you are cooking dinner, for example. Overall a very nice product and I would highly recommend it to anyone. After seeing it, my girlfriend is thinking about getting one for herself. PS: One thought I have is to attach some velcro to the back of the unit and attach it somewhere in my car other than the visor. You could also do this in your home so you could simply attach the speakerphone to a designated spot in your kitchen, or whatever room you plan to use it. That would make it very quick and ease to move from location to location without having to worry about the visor clip.",positive,positive,0.021364524287028553,0.06529814572755215,0.9133373299854194

"SUMMARY: Works, but it's flawed. Pros: Will charge an iPhone 4S from 0% to 100% one time plus an iPad from 60% to over 90% on a single charge. It feels very nice in the hand. It's a moderate weight. Standard USB output. Nice satin black finish and pleasant-to-hold shape.

The micro-usb input requires yet another cable type wherever you'll want to charge this thing. The four blue lights which show the extent of charge when it is being charged itself, do not appear to accurately report how much charge is remaining when it is charging a phone or whatever. (The lights over report how much charge the device itself has remaining.) The flashlight 'feature' is awkward to turn on, but can somehow turn itself on in a bag or pocket and drain the device. The laser-pointer 'feature' comes on before (!!) the flashlight in the press-sequence of the single button and can also turn itself on in a bag or pocket and drain the device. A single press of the button will turn the device on in a bag or pocket and drain the device - even when there is nothing attached to the device requiring a charge. There is no lock for the on/off button. And: The flashlight and laser pointer 'features' would have been better left out of the design.

"I've used this product for the past couple of days. Great design. Much smaller than you would expect from looking at the pictures. Here's a list of PROs and CONs. I won't cover anything you can get from the ""Technical Data"" section. PROs: 1) Call quality is great on the other end. People have commented that they didn't know I was calling them from my cellphone when using this headset. 2) You can turn off the headset by closing the mic boom. Unlike the older HS801 and maybe even the latest model, HS820, you can actually deactivate the headset just by folding the headset. Your phone will automatically revert to non-bluetooth mode. Open the mic boom and it'll sync automatically. Just make sure to set your phone to automatically detect the headset. 3) You can turn off the blinking lights while on a call so you don't look like a 'Star Trek' reject. Just press both volume buttons at the same time. The light will go off ONLY for the duration of that call. If it were up to me, I'd like to disable the lights altogether, but I'll take what I can get. 4) Great design. A must have for every got-to-have-it gadget person. And it matches the Motorola V600 perfectly. CONs: 1) Too quiet, even on the highest volume. The earphone is an open ear design so unfortunately, you can't really block out the sounds from your environment. When driving on the highway, this product becomes almost useless when calling someone who doesn't speak loudly. Doesn't help that my car's cabin isn't very quiet, so you may find the volume not an issue in a better acoustically sealed car. 2) Voice activation isn't very reliable. Only seems to work reliably in a quiet room. As with CON 1), you may not have an issue in a quiet car cabin. 3) The earpiece is not very comfortable. Again, this may not be an issue for you, but is for me. I'd give it a 6 or 7 out of 10, in terms of comfort. 4) The carrying case is very stylish, but poorly designed. The headset presses against the top of the case, causing the multi-function button to be continually pressed. The headset is off since the headset is folded, but continually pressing the multi-function button causes the lights to come on every few seconds within the caase. Maybe I'll try the neckstrap provided instead. Hope this helps.",neutral,neutral,0.2476471718436925,0.6449054881699349,0.10744733998637258

"That was my reaction whenever I tried to stick this thing in my ear. I don't know what is wrong with the people who are designing ear-pieces but I am starting to suspect that they have a deep hatred of mankind. I could never get it stuck into my right ear (the one I preferred) and I had to be feeling awfully masochistic to get it seated into my left. The little nub is somewhere between the size of a nickel and a quarter with absolutely no kind of allowance made for the natural size, shape and construction of the human ear. And the little plastic bit that is supposed to help you get it seated is just a waste of plastic. After that, the sound was good, the battery life was good and it worked exactly as advertised with no other problems. Just that one big one.

"After reading so many different reviews about so many different headsets, I decided to go with the Plantronics Voyager 510. My only hesitations were it's age and it's design. But, in the end I told myself that this one has gotten thousands of reviews and its average is still waaayyy up there. Let me tell you, this particular model works as advertised. Pros: Distance - It gets staticky around 25+ feet. Awesome! Clarity - I can hear the calls clearly because of the in ear style. Plus, people on the other end can hear me even when it's windy. Comfort - My girlfriend is constantly taking it off my ear because I forget that it's there. Versatility - I use both ears. My right side is preferred, but I use my left when I'm driving other people. Neutral: Battery - I really haven't gauged the timing of the battery life, but I'm not complaining about it. Cons: Design - It looks too funky, but for all of the function-over-form people, the 510 works great! Mic Boom - Because I have a wide face, the boom sometimes swivels in and touches my cheek (I hate anything touching my face unknowingly) Since purchasing this headset, I've tried 2 others, the Samsung Wep200 and the upgraded Plantronics Voyager 520. The Samsung was purchased for the girlfriend because its tiny structure was appealing. She complained that it wouldn't stay on her ear. I tried it and agreed. Also, it's clarity and distance was subpar relative to the 510. I ended up giving it to my brother. The Plantronics Voyager 520 was also purchased for the girlfriend because the Samsung didn't work out too well. She's making me go broke! I was honestly excited about the 520. After all, it was the latest and greatest. Latest it is, but greatest it isn't. It doesn't have different size ear buds like the 510, but luckily it fit her ear. (phew!) Distance is horrible. I can't go more than 10 feet without getting static. The size of this thing is a little on the HUGE side, but I still think it looks better than the 510. It's noise cancellation works like the 510, which is one good thing. Bottom line, if it wasn't for its poor performance with distance, my girlfriend would have loved it AND I wouldn't have to return it and find her a new one. The things I do for that woman! If you're reading this, I still love you hunni! :) Conclusion: If it wasn't for the 2 Cons factors, this headset would be perfect for me! But relative to its replacement the 520 and the Samsung, this model is hands down THE headset to get.",positive,neutral,0.05874212079278082,0.897849180361853,0.04340869884536617

"I shopped around for the perfect Pet Barrier for about a month. I narrowed my search down to this one and another Mesh Barrier. I ordered the other barrier and it never came in stock. That was a blessing in disguise as this barrier was less expensive and has exceeded my expectations. I have a 2001 Subaru Forester and this barrier is a perfect fit in the hatch compartment. I did not have any trouble assembling and installing the barrier. So far, it does not rattle and is serving its purpose very well. It gets warm in the hatch compartment as there are no air vents and my hatch door window doesn't roll down.

"It looks nice in pictures, and I think it is in fact an attractive item. However, in the picture, do you see how far the credit cards are inserted into the pocket? The pocket doesn't go all the way down, and that's exactly how far a CC will go in. Notice how the card partially covers one of the snaps. You can't snap it closed once a card is [partially!!!] inserted in the pocket. You can fold up a few dollar bills and put it in the pocket, and then snap it, but that's all the ""wallet"" portion is good for. This is not an exaggeration, it's just too small to use. It has one magnetic snap, but the other two snaps are very tight. To avoid damaging the phone, you need to take your phone out before you can exert the pressure required to open the snaps on the wallet section. I suspect those who describe it positively, are just looking at it, and haven't tried to use it yet. On the one I received, the magnetic clasp was not centered properly on the flap. I have to twist it funny to get the two flaps to line up so it will snap shut, then it remains distorted. Maybe others don't have this problem.

"This has been my longest lasting holster for a Blackberry, so far. Over 2 years and counting. To me, 'wearing' a Blackberry is second-nature, having had one attached to may waist for more than 10 years now, so I may be as good as getting my Blackberry in an out if its holster as a gunslinger is with his gun. There's a lot I like about this holster and here I'm putting it down in a list: - makes it easy to get the Blackberry out or lock it in quickly - professional-looking black leather - the rubberized sides make it hold the BB tight - strong magnetic locking - VERY strong, really - swivel is okay, makes it easier to clip/unclip the holster - solid, strong build - like I said, I've been wearing this one almost daily for more than 2 years and it doesn't show signs of breaking or cracking yet Two so-so or interesting remarks. First, I agree with another reviewer that it's not so friendly to love handles. I can't say that I have them but, in the summer, when my employer (thank you employer) allows me to dress very casually, the clip sometimes presses into my skin. This is not a problem at all during other seasons because I have something tucked in my pants then so the clip does not touch the skin directly. Secondly, it's the magnetic lock. It's so strong, it will pick up small metallic objects such as paperclips and even larger ones if they happen to be near. Overall, I am happy with this holster and I'm likely to be using it for a while longer. It's a 5-star.",positive,positive,0.004127247549479331,0.10097050298219197,0.8949022494683286

"This product has ""cheap"" and ""poor design"" written all over it. It does work -- your iphone will be attached to the windshield. But even with all three (three!) very ugly arm parts attached, it cannot achieve enough bend to get the iphone aligned with your eyes. In other words, it doesn't handle the slope of a typical windshield. Bear in mind I'm using mine on a truck, not a race car, so there's not much slope to begin with. The cheap plastic does not flex, but the whole contraption bounces when the iphone is in it and you're driving down the road. Very distracting if you're using the GPS function, as I am. The audio cable that comes with it the cheapest quality I've ever seen, and short. I haven't used the secondary mounting device (glue a disk to your dash, apply the suction cup to that).

"It functionally works, so I can't complain. I therefore give it 3 stars to be neutral. For the price, it's not such a bad deal. Pros: Holds my iPhone securely in the bracket Cons: Cord too short, suction cup is cumbersome to attach and release as you rotate a knob that's not designed for a quick mount or release. The range is limited, in that the crane is short in length and will not extend or swing around for adjustment. The car charger I bought of this brand also died after 2 weeks of use in my car. I went to the Apple store and bought a nice solid gooseneck that plugs right into my car charger to charge the battery, hook up to my stereo speakers, and does not obscure the view of the windshield as the hard flexible gooseneck extends vertically up from the charger and floats the device solidly in air instead.

"I got this BT headset to go with my Samsung Instinct. My older Plantronics Voyager 510 died just before I recieved the Instinct. I figured I would try a differnt model for the new phone. Sorry I did really. I will be returning the 855. Overall it is not that bad I guess. Here is why I am returning it. 1. The biggest problem is the sound. On my end everything is very ""tin can sounding"" and actually there is quite a bit of static as well. People I called said I sounded fine to them though. I had to use the extra ear piece(stereo setup) for people to sound good..sorta. 2. The silicone ear piece. I just really don't like the way it feels in my ear. But this is a personal thing. Others may find it work well for them. Just not me. 3. The volume control kept defaulting back to super quiet. Everytime I made a call, or used the voice calling features on my phone I have to reset the volume on the headset back to an acceptable level. Kind of a pain to have to do that. Actaully quite annoying to me. 4. The thing just doesn't feel like it is made to last. Feels cheaply built. The sliding boom mic won't last I know it. This is again personal opinion. Others may be fine with it. 5. you really have to add the over ear hook. At least for me it won't stay in my ear very long otherwise. Kinda silly to make the ear hook optional when you really have to use it. Ok the good. 1. When I added ear hook it works fine and is really pretty comfortable. 2. The weight of the whole setup is great. Compared to my older 510 I hardly knew it was there. 3. It paired with my Instinct super easy. So over all I am not happy with it. I give it 3 stars because some of what I feels is wrong with it are my issues with it. These may not be issues for others. Although the call quality probably will be for most people.

"I purchased the Body Glove case and it's been on my LG Voyager, along with a screen protector since day one. The case provides excellent protection; the phone will be two years old in a few months and it still looks like brand new. I'm able to charge the phone and access all of the buttons and features of the touch screen with no problems. Based on the performance of this case, I purchased the same brand for my son's LG Dare phone and have been just as satisfied. The case does make the phone a little bulkier, but it's a minor issue compared to the great protection it provides.",positive,positive,0.004598888249484474,0.026304960390035968,0.9690961513604796
"I absolutely LOVE this device! I found it at the California State Fair in the marketplace of exhibits. The booth had several of these set up at the foot of chairs and the people running the booth called me over to have a seat. What attracted me was the fact I did not have to take my shoes off. I placed my feet on the device and then the attendant placed another massager on top of my feet to really sandwich the massage in place. I IMMEDIATELY felt relieved. I wanted it on the high setting and once there, I could just feel it melting away all the achy tiredness my feet were feeling from walking around the fairgrounds all day. It is like those FOOTSIE-WOOTSIE chairs you see at big events that cost .25 cents a minute. After sitting in the chair for several minutes, that is when they broke out the price. It was a little more than I expected, cost wise, but I had already been sold, so it was difficult to say NO. However, I did not have the money at the time and kept a mental note that I was going to eventually get this massager. After a few months of saving up, I decided to purchase it and it was very easy to do using Amazon. Hence why I am writing this review. The entire experience was pleasurable, I would do it all over again, and I would definitely recommend this to a friend.",positive,negative,0.4005011873085104,0.2044056230125579,0.3950931896789317

"No doubt Jabra is the best selling bluetooth headset these days, and for sure it's not the best bluetooth headset on the market, but have to give credit to their marketing department which is doing a good job in promoting this headset. I used to own this Jabra headset, my first impression of this headset is big and it's too obvious on the ear. Amazingly it wasn't heavy and that's good. The headset did a good job in pairing to my phone, it sounded fine, but the range is quite bad, I can't walk to far away from the phone even it said 10 meters range. I was just 2 meters away, the sound quality droped significanly. The battery life was also a problem, have to charge whenever I got a chance. Recently I found a good headset, STEP 1150, which is little known and made by a company called STEP Communications. It got a good review from PC World magazine. (...) It's a small profile headset, all day wearing comfort and long battery life. I highly recommend it.",neutral,positive,0.04245616340521019,0.25279900401995753,0.7047448325748322

"Here's the deal, no bluetooth headset, and for that fact no headset is perfect. Now...with that in mind, let me give a little bit of background. I have had more headsets, cell phones, and other hands free devices in the past few years than most people will have in a lifetime. I have poor hearing due to numerous surgeries on my ears and have found that while I can headsets are great for me when I'm in a completely quiet environment. Having said all of that, I bought the BT800 about 3 weeks ago after reading numerous reviews from a plethora of sources and coming to the conclusion that the vast majority of the comparisons and reviews I read rated this headset as #1. As stated I have had the headset for about 3 weeks. Getting to the functionality...it pairs with my phone and laptop with absolutely no problems/issues. My first few calls left me feeling as if the ear piece could fall off of my ear at any point in time, however after wearing it longer and longer and making hours of calls I have found that the headset is surprisingly sturdy. The inbound audio is remarkable, and when compared to nearly if not every other headset I've ever had, it's the best. The microphone is nearly ""too good"" and it took me numerous phone calls to finally figure out that the microphone is so sensitive that you have to position the headset so that the microphone is pointing sideways or even a little upward (not down towards your mouth). Getting to the point I spend about 2 - 6 hours a day on my cell phone and would guesstimate that I spend about 3 - 5 of that while using my headset. The headset is comfortable, the audio is great, the microphone is loud, and the DSP works quite well. Bluetooth pairing is a breeze and it took me about 2 minutes (after charging) to set the headset up. The only negatives I have had so far have been with regards to ""voice signal."" I use voice dialing often and have found that when using any means other than the headset my voice dialing software is about 85 - 90 % accurate. When using the headset my initial results were about 20 - 30% accuracy. As I have had the headset for a while I have found a few ways to improve this and would guess that my accuracy via the headset when making voice dialing is now probably around 75 - 85%. It's not perfect, but considering everything else it's really the least of my problems. Overall I would highly recommend this product. I am enclosing a few links to various reviews that I have come across on the web. A few of these have very detailed information that you may find useful with this purchasing decision. 1. [...] [...] Good luck and happy talking.",positive,positive,0.006661918564682262,0.038423815634784746,0.9549142658005331

"Hi, I got the Q a week ago, reset it a few times had various other issues.. But fairly happy with the phone.. But... I left the house this morning with a full charge (9 AM), went to lunch at 12:40 and the phone was working fine (full battery charge) - showed it to a friend at lunch, and was trying to bring up Internet Explorer... It couldn't connect to any sites (2 bars) - I said OK, fine and left it alone.. By 2:30 the phone was DEAD, no signs of life, removing the battery, nothing... Attempting to charge it on USB - NO LUCK - (it appears to respect the USB protocol of not drawing any real power until the device tells the host it needs power - something that should be done in hardware/firmware..) I was able to get it to come up with a car adaptor.. Got enough charge on it, and I was able to transfer it to the USB. (First attempt failed, went back and charged it until it stopped beeping) Now, it is sitting there ""charging"" - but burrning power to keep the display on, backlight on, and the CPU running to display an image of a stupid battery 'filling' - which is totally useless (if you are going to show me something, tell me how full my battery CURRENTLY IS), but worse, is likly burning 20-50% of the power it is getting from the USB! I don't think a super large replacement battery would have done ANYTHING for me - except extend the time till it died, maybe as much as 4 hours. My guess is that it locked up while transmitting at full power or something... They say standby of 238 hours or something, but I say better charge it daily, and don't count on it after lunch..

"I bought this phone when my Audiovox 8500 was stolen. The 8610 is generally a step up from that older model. It has a nice color screen. Menu navigation is easy, and it was no problem creating contacts and single-digit shortcuts to frequently called numbers. Reception and sound quality during a call are excellent. Although this phone is slightly bulkier than the 8500, it's still very small and easy to tuck into your pocket. The phone has the option to choose from several ""desktops"" for different looks on the screen. The ones Virgin Mobile preloads are generally pretty dumb looking, but no harm done. The phone also allows for a choice of screen savers, but Virgin Mobile only has one installed without an option to get more. It's a silly feature, anyway -- a cell phone doesn't need a screen saver. Oh, and don't forget, it comes preloaded with two games. One is sort of like Tetris. I don't use them, but my wife thinks they are all right. Virgin Mobile itself has very good customer service, and their pay-as-you-go setup is good if you don't make a lot of calls. They stand by their phones... if yours stops working under warranty, they will replace it without hassle. Audiovox has improved the ringtone quality from the previous model. Now the tunes sound good, not embarrassing, and you can also get sound effects and even voices yelling at you to answer the phone. (Of course that option will annoy everyone around you!) They even have a plain-sounding ring tone you can use, which believe it or not, the old 8500 model didn't have! My one big complaint is that the ringtone doesn't get loud enough. I can hear other peoples' cell phones ring all the time on the bus, on the street, etc. But with the Audiovox 8610, if there's any ambient noise, forget it, you probably won't hear your phone ring even when it's set at maximum volume. I use the ""ring and vibrate"" setting to help make up for this. Aside from the soft ringtones, I like this phone a lot and I recommend it! UPDATE: Nearly two and a half years later, this phone is still going strong. It looks completely beat up from being carried around in my pocket, but it's never failed me. There are newer and more feature-filled phones on the market, but for the basics, this one is still a winner!",positive,neutral,0.06065999471670155,0.47823724815226953,0.46110275713102894

"I bought this phone with 1 year option back in Sep 2005 and being a savvy user of Old Palm PDA Vx thought it would be a great product but ... Pros: Very nice and FAST querries and features for phone book, calendar and general PDA stuff One hand operation Tonnes of extra stuff free/$$ including voice dial which searches your own phone book without any training etc Ring tone compatibility and if you how to do it it's FREE. Any MP3 can ring for you nice resolution vivid screen with several tweeks available bluetooth transfer to phone from your car works like a charm - well most of the times - see below External memory support for expansion :-) loved this feature OK to nice mp3 sound quality after messaging mp3's a bit and glad to say it's not a battery killer if played withh little monitoring. Cons: 3 out of 10 chances are if your two year old dropped it it won't come back 7 of 10 chances that if you're using bluetooth it will reboot right in the middle of the call 5 of 10 people will complain that they can't hear you or you can't hear them properly 8 of 10 chances (let's make it 9.5) you will hear static and hissing and hum sound along with or without bluetooth and/or speakerphone Great PDA bad phone worse bluetooth compatibility great sync and desktop software. I replaced three phones in 9 months as a part of warranty - thanks to cingular and then they finally gave me a blackberry 8700c. So my question to palm: What were you thinking????

"With a dozen digital cameras and loads of kids toys to power, we have hundreds of rechargeable batteries. These perform as good as Japanese 2650mah Duracells. Even in cameras that don't like rechargeable batteries, these read full power and last 2X longer than a quality alkaline.

Charge time is roughly 7 hours, and they read about 1.4VDC when fully charged and 1.1VDC when exhausted. They have no problem with my 1 hour fast chargers from Duracell, Energizer and Kodak. The C & D cell adapters work fine. Of course, a AA just can't deliver the power of the larger battery and they die about 3X faster than the appropriate alkaline. Still, they come in very handy!

"Finally, a PDA, phone, and MP3 player all in one. And the Treo 650 delivers, if it weren't for the bugs! The Palm portions work as you'd expect, the screen is awesome, and it syncs with my Linux box faster and more reliably over Bluetooth ([...] (So I don't care much if the unit can't read Microsucks documents.) The system used to reset itself daily, or sometime require a manual reset when you couldn't turn it off, or on, or when it hung. Most of these resets disappeared when I ran the dbScan software that comes with DateBk5 to remove deleted records. You can get the dbScan software from the DateBk5 site. I read another review here that the 1.20 firmware update helped the stability too. I'll have to try it. The VersaMail application as well as the Bluetooth and Network preferences pages have some usability issues. The VersaMail application reverted to factory defaults--losing my mail--twice over the past six months. The Palm Wireless headset sometimes doesn't pick up calls, but when it does, the sound appears to be pretty good. Wish I could turn up the volume more though. Sharing the same power cord with the Treo is a welcome feature. The phone is surprisingly robust. It's taken a lot of lickings and keeps on ticking. However, it took its last fall last week (and it was a beaut--it leaped out of its case while I was sprinting across a street) which rendered some of the phone operations inoperative. Tip: Don't get the Covertec horizontal pouch case which rotates and dumps the phone nearly every time you get out of the car, or releases the phone when you run. Someone mentioned that the text was hard to read. I'm over 40 and can read the crisp lettering just fine without my glasses. The keyboard is nice too: I could use Grafitti very well (I wrote a trip journal for two months in Grafitti!) but can type a whole lot faster and more accurately with the keyboard.

"I owned this Bluetooth before, and also previously owned the Motorola H500, as well as a couple of others. Nothing beats the Motorola Bluetooth headset, and my original one lasted over 7 years, even though I broke (cracked) it, and glued it back together, and it continued to work until it just gave out. I like that it hangs snugly around your ear, and nothing protrudes into your ear; it lays flush against your ear. I never have a problem hearing, and no one has a problem hearing me. It is very easy to operate, and the range is better than the phone range itself. I love being hands free, and hate when anyone calls on the home phone because I cannot be hands free unless I put them on speaker. I would recommend this Bluetooth for anyone looking for an easy, comfortable, and long lasting Bluetooth.",positive,positive,0.03305080491534662,0.030683391234989768,0.9362658038496636

"I had an over the ear headset which I dearly loved, but the bayonet ear piece kept falling off and getting lost. I had to get something and searched the internet.

"Pros: * Nice stereo audio quality * Comfortable. (This might not be true if you have thick-framed glasses.) * Inconspicuous, no big blue lights flashing on the side of your head. From the front, it's hard to tell that you're wearing headphones without looking closely. * Some features work as promised, pauses when answering phone call, music resumes after hanging up. Cons: * Handsfree function: The handsfree microphone is in the right ear and not very clear, the handset audio is left ear only. In wind it is useless; in a noisy environment, it is very poor. In a quiet environment, it is usable. Don't get it if you want a good voice headset. * The buttons for forward and backward are very sensitive on my unit. This is a problem because the play/pause button is smack dab between them and they are all so small that you have to feel around to orient you finger to find any of them. If I'm not *very careful*, I'll hit backward or forward in the process and lose my place. This poses a real problem with audio books. * If the music transmitter device is in my front pants pockets, the signal constantly starts and stops. This was really bad with the Jabra A125s iPod adapter, and merely unacceptable streaming from a BlackBerry 8330 Curve. If the transmitter is carried in a backpack, it hardly cuts out at all. Maybe it's all the iron in my blood, but it doesn't seem to travel well through my person. I tried my back pants pockets and still no better. * Battery life needs work. You can't use this if you listen to music all day. * I keep having to re-pair it every time I turn it on. Maybe it's because I hop around between 3-4 devices so often, but it is supposed to keep pairings for 8 devices. Still haven't figured this out.

"This product is good for the price but has its flaws. As far as reflective mirror like qualities go it gets 5 out of 5. It acts EXACTLY like a mirror, no wobble effect or haziness at all that I have noticed so far. It went on without any problem and VERY minor bubbles that were easily taken care of. However it does haze up your screen a bit even in dark areas, which I don't mind but the main draw back is that it gives your screen a colorful appearance much like that of a TV that has had a magnet get a little to close to it. I wouldn't say full on magnet to screen but a definite ""rainbow"" effect. It also does not seem to be the static kind of SP that is capable of being removed and reinstalled as stated in the product description.

"I saw all the ratings saying that it did not catch all the disks as well as the permanent ones in their home courses. I agreed that I wanted to save the money and since it would only be for practice I did not think I would care. But after I got it in my backyard it sure bugged me more than I expected. I was surprised (or frustrated) just how many ""good shoots"" fell out the back or sides of the chains. So I spent $27 on extra chain and s hooks. Maybe someone has a better and/or cheaper way to upgrade the chains but my new configuation performs well. I do not think it matters how the extra chains go on the basket as I tried it two ways. The extra weight seems to stop most disks that use to pass through the stock chain system. Also the height of the basket is lower than the average permanent ones on the course I play, so, it is hard to get a feel for just how far a miss will travel past the basket that was correct height (I do not know the correct height of a basket but it is about 6 inches low of the average at my home course). Although lots of different shots on the course help go into your decision to ""go for it"" when putting. Like up hill or down hill shots. Just another example of where the basket as is is not giving proper feedback as all the shots into a low basket hit the ground soon after a miss simular to an uphill shot or putt. I hope that all complaining is helpful because I want to add that the ease of assembly, structure, weight all seem good or as expected. I love having a basket in my backyard. I have been using it everyday. It's nice to just grab my six putters for a minute or two on the way in our out of the house. Sometimes I spend more time with different lengths. Lots of practice for me. My putting is getting better quickly!!!

"I'm not very happy with Virgin Mobile about this one. I've been using their service for years and have had at least a half-dozen of their phones. Overall I was happy with their service, but when I bought this phone almost two years ago my opinion of them started going down. Other than the battery issues that others have mentioned here, it worked OK for the first few months. Then I started getting text messages that were days old, or not getting them at all. I contacted VM support through the web site and they responded within 24 hours, but they wanted me to document when messages were sent and when I received them. I didn't have time to deal with it at the time and just decided to do without texting for a while. When I wanted to try fixing it again, they promptly said that this is a known problem with the phone and that they would send me another one. I got it within a couple of days, got it set up and it worked fine (other than the weak battery still.) However, after a few months I started having the texting problem again. When I contacted them they responded promptly again, and this time offered to send me a different phone. Without thinking I said OK, but then I did a little research on the phone they were going to send me (the TNT) and found that it didn't have bluetooth, one of the features that I bought the Flare for. I emailed them again and said, wait, I want a phone with the same features as the one they're replacing. They pretty much said that i have the choices of keeping the Flare without texting if I want bluetooth, take the TNT and have texting but no bluetooth, or buy a new phone. It also occurred to me that when I bought the Flare it was a $40 phone, the TNT was $20 most of the time that they sold it, if not from day 1. I think it's pretty cheezey of them to give me an older, cheaper phone with less features than the one that they're replacing. If they were more customer-service oriented, they would have offered me a better phone when I pointed out the lack of features in the replacement phone, even if it was a little more expensive when new.

"I read the advice here before I bought this. Amazon has the best price i could find on it, and I spent 1.5 hours goggling prices. It is absolutely essential to get the jabra eargels with this, the partnumber is listed in a prior review, from Verizon store. This makes it fit the ear almost perfectly. Failure to do so will make you very very unhappy! One issue was bending the wire to the correct conformation to loop on my ear and position the unit in the ear canal. I suggest starting with the smaller loop wires, as they are easier to bend to shape. Twice already I've gone around looking for my headset only to realize i already had it in my ear! I guess that says it all for comfort. I haven't had any other experience w/ bluetooth devices, but no one has complained about hearing me even in the most crowded noisy places, so it looks like noise assassin lives up to it's billing. The thing I like best about this is hands free operation. I can talk to people while I'm working on my other computer or doing other tasks, and I have no problems getting things done whilst talking, unlike the cramped neck hold it in place that I used to have trying to hold a microhand set to my ear w/ my neck So I gave it five stars because I couldn't imagine what else i'd need in a headset, and I recommend it to my friends.",positive,positive,0.01906580425363965,0.11138341754885189,0.8695507781975085

"This phone drops calls on a regular basis, and is for all practical purposes barely usable as a phone. I've had mine replaced 2 times and the sim card swapped out several times as well. Still, it drops calls again and again, probably 20% of calls end in a drop. I ended up purchasing another phone a full retail and junking mine! A couple of other gripes about this phone include: - The ring tones are terrible so plan on buying one. - The ringer volume starts low and get's louder on each successive ring and you can't change this. If the phone is in another room, by the time it's loud enough to hear, you won't catch the call. - You can't turn the chime off for text messages, even when the phone is in silent mode for say a movie or meeting, your phone will chime when you get a text message. - The speaker/earpiece is loud, but for some reason still hard to hear.

"It might be worth the risk for you since it's so cheap, but don't buy it expecting it to work. Problems: It came factory sealed and broken... the sticky mounting arm bracket had been shoved through it's clips as if it had had something very heavy dropped on it. This also speaks to the cheapness of the plastic. The vent mount (which is why I bought it and soldiered on) doesn't comfortably fit any car I've tried it in. It can technically be mounted in my GF's car, but not with the support brace so it would be wobbly. It barely holds an iPhone 4 with no case, you have to clamp it down hard, and if you angle it just right could probably plug in a charging cable (if you need one). But it does technically hold it well enough. You will have to release the clamp (spring loaded button) and re-clamp it (just squeeze) every time you use it. It does NOT hold a 3GS or a first gen at all. The bottom brace is too small and the curved designs on those models make them just slide off. It does NOT fit a 3GS with a case on it. My GF uses a very thin back shell and at maximum width it can be crammed in but just barely, and again, because of the curved phone design the base is too small and it still falls out. Basically if you get one that's not broken and have an un-cased iPhone 4, and plan to mount it with the arm it might work, and it's cheap enough you might want to try. If you want the vent mount don't expect it to fit. If you have an iPhone other than a 4, or use a thick case on a 4, don't expect it to fit. It's very cheaply made from brittle plastic (that you have to stress to set up...) so really keep your expectations in check.",negative,negative,0.5269533701480626,0.46964827664091996,0.003398353211017408
"First off, this is a great phone for many reasons. Read the five-star reviews if you want a glowing perspective. I agree with aspects of all of them. If you are coming from the Treo 600/650 series, however, which allows you pretty much complete control over the phone's behavior, has fairly strong vibration, AND is a decent PDA, this phone will frustrate you to no end. Example: Let's say the only time you want this phone to make a (speaker-based) noise is when a call is coming in. Sorry - not possible. If you have your phone set to make an audible ring, and you DON'T want it to give you an error beep (which is incredibly loud) when you make a trivial ""mistake"" in the complex user interface, you are out of luck. I tried turning EVERYTHING off but the ring in the ""Normal"" profile, and I still get the error beep. It's louder than the ring, by the way - and does not seem affected by any volume control. The frustrating thing is that there are actually phone settings for turning off various alerts. E.g., ""Warnings,"" ""Questions,"" ""Exclamations."" All of these are set to off (you'd think an ""error"" would fall into one of those categories), and still I get thunderous error beeps. Note there is a vibrate-only mode (called Meeting) that doesn't beep for errors, but then you're stuck with its wimpy vibration. I can't feel the Q vibrate in any pocket. Maybe if I carry it between my teeth I'll be okay. Note that you don't actually have to make an error to get an error beep. Example: Enter an address in the browser, and press the RETURN key instead of the ""Go"" soft key. Both navigate you appropriately, but hitting RETURN gives you an error beep. It's like your phone is saying to you, ""You hit the wrong (yet completely intuitive and fully operational) key! BEEEEEP!!!"" Also, when you insert or remove the power cord: ""BEEEEP!!!"" Plus, in typical Microsoft style, you actually get a full-screen dialog when you pull out the cord. ""Charging is complete!"" it tells you, with a button to dismiss the message. ""Um, yes - I KNOW it's complete. I just freaking got out of bed and unplugged it. But thanks for scaring the life out of me."" If a calendar is important to you (as it is for most PDA users - probably the sole reason to cary one), I'd steer way clear of this phone. The interface for accessing, viewing, and creating appointments is cumbersome at best. Also, it's missing key functionality: E.g: I get my hair cut every other week; my cleaning service comes every other week; There is no way to set a recurring appointment for every other week! If you want a phone that's a real PDA, get the treo 650 or 700, even though it's heavier and fatter. I can only speak for the Palm OS version, which is excellent, usability-wise. After using this phone, I'm now nervous about the 700w - considering that phone and the Q both run on the same company's software. Needless to say, I'm returning mine.",neutral,negative,0.5255346647371332,0.46724651676574624,0.007218818497120541

"I brought it last year because I don't want to carry an mp3 player and a phone at the same time. I was extremely disappointed that when I brought the phone that it does not include itunes and it turns out that there are 2 different versions of v3i- one with itunes installed and another with DAP (motorola's digital audio player.) I ended upgrading the phone with a firmware which allows you to have both itunes, with 100 song limit and DAP, (just google dmatt). I got lucky and it comes with a 256mb card, but I upgraded to a FAR 512mb microsd card. By all means, this does not replace an ipod or anything like that but I am not picky about mp3 players. The itunes that it comes with is simple at best, and it does not support some mp3 formats and I had to reencode them to make it work.

"This phone was great, with good functionability, wifi, music player, organizer, and all that, until it broke. after about two months, the LCD screen cracked, simply in my pocket in the car. i didn't drop it or anything, yet the LCD cracks, cant use the phone anymore. So i take it to the store, and this is apparently my fault, so no manufactor's warranty. They tell me to call a phone repair company in my area to have it replaced. I look online and find that many other people have had this same problem, as the LCD's on this phone are very thin and can crack with the smallest ammount of pressure. That repair company says they are sold out of the screens now, as they have sold 50 replacements in the past 3 weeks. I didn't know that t-mo sold that many dashes in the area every three weeks. So i can wait around for the replacement LCD's to be restocked, then pay 150 for the same thin delicate screen. Sorry, but i would never buy this again, seeing as i am sure that it will break again, and i will be completely out of luck, again. I don't know the specifics, but the t-mo extended warranty has a deductable on top of the initial payment, so that isn't even a practiucle solution, in my opinion.",negative,negative,0.9113709439463472,0.08625428850490978,0.0023747675487432065

"One of the first reviews for the New Motorola Motorokr S9-HD Bluetooth stereo headset. I will be occasionally comparing this to the original and current S9 (which is extremely successful for Motorola. I am using this on the HTC touch and HP Pavilion notebook Hardware Construction. Solid 9/10 Really well made and light about (even lighter than the original S9) many subtle improvements:- Much more comfortable Extremely rugged New finger friendly controls A ribbed rubberized inner section to stop sliding New ear plugs that are just great (also it comes with a selection well done Motorola) Improved microphone ( I found the S9 not really usable outdoors people complained too much about the background noise and couldn't hear me not one complaint on the new unit. (it even came with adaptor for the Iphone). Reception/Signal. Excellent 9/10. I found the strength of this far superior to the old unit and does work approx 30 feet away still get the occasional `breaking up' but very rare once again vastly improved over the S9 Sound clarity 10/10. lus now conversations are through both speakers .This is what its all about! Truly incredible, I thought the S9 was good but wait till you listen. Almost as good as my top of the range wired Sure headphones (Seriously AMAZING, and I am a sound geek ) .it even has 2 sound settings plus noise cancellation. Controls 8/10. You really have to read the manual for this to max its features but easy thereafter. Battery Life approx 6 hours Additional comments: Best Bluetooth headset I've used by far, the only improvement would be for me is if the unit folded in some way and could go in my pocket.

"I received this speaker as a gift, and was very excited to try it out. The main purpose behind the gift was so that I could stream my music and movies/TV shows from the internet (ie: Pandora and NetFlix) to the speaker. When we set it up, we immediately realized that there was a problem. The speaker kept cutting out even though the song (or movie) was still streaming online (you could see the progress indicator still moving). After a few minutes of cutting sound cutting out, the internet would then freeze. With the internet frozen, the music, or movie, was stalled. The only thing that worked to fix the problem was to turn off the bluetooth and reset the internet. I learned, after some research online, that this was likely a problem relating to a single frequency router I had (2.4GHz). Both my internet and the bluetooth were running on the same 2.4GHz frequency, this causing interference and dropping both the bluetooth and ultimately the internet connection. I decided I liked the idea of the speaker enough to purchase a refurbished dual band router (2.4GHz and 5.0GHz), so to dedicate my internet to the 5.0GHz and the speaker's bluetooth to the 2.4GHz (the speaker only operates at the 2.4 GHz frequency). While it is better, it does still experience occasional cutting out of the sound and internet problems (though the internet does not ""stop"" anymore). I find it largely depends on where I am physically located in the room, and/or where my computer is in relation to the speaker. I should note that this doesn't happen when I play songs straight from my computer hard-drive. When I contacted Soundtooth to inquire about this problem, they ""Thank you for your reply. Sorry for the inconvenience. Please contact your retailer for after-sales service. If any problem occur with them, Please contact us again informing where you bought it."" I find that to be an unacceptable answer. They made no attempt to troubleshoot. I will say, when it works- it does it's job very well. If I didn't have the interference problems and if the customer support wasn't crappy, it would have gotten a better review.",neutral,neutral,0.3370900641220093,0.6080217941524594,0.05488814172553132

"This phone looks good on paper, in person, and in my pocket, but it was a huge hassle to use compared to a Treo. First, everything runs sluggishly and it takes a long time to do anything. The Treo has less memory but runs much faster because it is better optimized, and more importantly, has a touch screen. With the touch screen, I can click on links, buttons, etc., even with my finger, which saves a lot of time compared to using the thumbwheel and arrowpad. Finally, the Q's battery life was terrible. I thought I received a defective unit so I had it exchanged...the second unit was just as awful. Finally, the Q's keyboard looks better and is bigger, but is harder to use -- the keys are harder to press and because the system is slow, sometimes keypresses don't register (while Windows Mobile is trying to catch up or something).

"Don't expect this phone to work any better than a Motorola V551. I wrongly thought with the price as high as it was that I'd have perfect reception and no dropped calls. Nothing has changed. Don't get me wrong, this matte black phone is slim and sexy and lightweight fun and easy to slip into a pocket. But those are it's biggest draws. Some other cons include: -The large square screen and key pad get dirty easily from holding the phone up to your face. I don't wear make-up, but if I did, I can imagine that I'd always be taking a toothpick to all of those little crevices between the keys on the flat keypad all the time. As it is now, I'm constantly wiping the screen and keys. -The battery life is not long and if you're going anywhere overnight, remember to bring your charger. -The operating system is the same as other newer model Motorola phones, so don't expect a big upgrade there either. If Cingular is your provider, the sim card from your current phone will work in this unlocked version nicely.

"I agree with most that the sound quality and ease of use is great, in fact, excellent. Why only two stars? They may be the most uncomfortable headphones I've ever used. No, I do not have an extreme size melon. I have other headphones using the same ""back of the head"" support that I love. I suspect the main cause is the weight. They feel fine for about 15 minutes, then it shifts to ""head in a closing vise"" mode, with the added bonus of feeling as if my ears are being slowly sheered off my head. I keep bending the support band in hopes of finding a sweet spot...no luck yet. I guess my next approach will be padding...then a complete re-engineering of the support. Having said that, maybe they are the perfect fit for someone else's head.

"I bought this screen protector for my q9c and I must say, I am pretty happy with it. It fits very well and was pretty easy to put on. The only thing I don't care for is how easy it is to leave smudges all over the protector. My protector didn't come with a squeegee, but the silicone backing means you don't really need it. If you realize you have a little dust under the protector, apply a strip of scotch tape to the corner closest to the dust, slip the point of an exacto blade CAREFULLY between the screen and protector to get it started a little, lift up a bit with the tape, and remove the dust from the protector with the sticky side of a piece of scotch tape. Then carefully reapply the protector from center to corner, remove the tape, and remove any tape residue with a microfiber cloth.

"The good: Finally! An all-in-one device that actually does everything pretty well! A couple years ago I bought a Sidekick thinking it would do it all. It did, but it did everything rather badly. The feedback on the phone line was so bad that everyone I talked to complained about hearing their own voices coming back to them. I ended up swapping my SIM card back and forth between my trusty Motorola for phone calls, and the Sidekick to browse the web. As a web browser, it was better than nothing, but only slightly. It was awfully slow and timed out a lot. As a PDA, it wasn't too impressive either. The features were so stripped down that I ended up going back to my old Ipaq. So I was schlepping around three gadgets, and carrying an oversized purse to make room for them all. By contrast, the 6315 has excellent sound quality as a phone. As a PDA, it is great - just what I'm used to. As a web browser, its speed is decent using GPRS, better with WIFI. Plus Bluetooth! And I have always loved the fact that Ipaqs have downsized versions of MS Word and Excel so that I can keep a running expense log, and do some writing when I have a spare minute. Thus, despite the many problems I'll mention, I am pretty content with my 6315. Also, while some have groused that the Ipaq is only available with T-Mobile right now, for me this is a positive. I use my phone ALL THE TIME, and I was fortunate enough to latch onto T-Mobile's 3,000 anytime minutes for $49.99 plan a few years ago. There is no other company that has a comparable plan, with a comparable selection of gadgets and phones, for anywhere close to that price! The bad: There are some bugs that need to be worked out. The phone turns itself off for no apparent reason now and then, and I discover hours after the fact that all my calls have been going to voicemail. Also, even when I set it to require the PIN before making a call, sometimes it does, sometimes it does not. When I have the earphone plugged in, the phone makes no external sound whatever. So if I make a call using the headset, and then just take off the headset without unplugging, all my calls and alerts are inaudible. It's not as hands free as I would like. On my Motorola, I could just hit one button to open my phone book, scroll down a set number of times (1 for Mom, 2 for Dad, 3 for best friend, etc.), and then hit another button to send the call, all without taking my hand off the steering wheel or my eyes off the road. The Ipaq requires both hands and my full attention to turn it on, access my contact list, navigate to the right person, and click the link that will make the call. In other words, it demands more attention than a car radio, and is thus unsafe to use while driving. Grr! The downright irritating: If you hold the device up to your ear to take a call, your cheek or jaw WILL touch the touch screen, setting off all manner of other functions or disconnecting the call. There needs to be some way of disabling the screen when you want to. The only solution I've found is springing another $30 for an INNOPOCKET aluminum case, which lets you at most of the buttons but protects the screen behind an acrylic window. If you have WiFi on, your browsing will be interrupted constantly as new WiFi sites are detected, and God help you if there is a T-Mobile hotspot anywhere nearby! You will be rerouted to a security screen asking for registration and password, and even if you don't want to use the Hotspot and pay T-Mobile charges, you cannot get away from this screen!!! I hate this so much that I only use WiFi when I'm darned sure there are no T-Mobile stores anywhere nearby. For whatever reason, T-Mobile sells the 6315 but none of the accessories, and in my experience, the sales reps at T-Mobile stores know diddly about the device's compatibility issues. They offered me a Jabra Bluetooth headset, but fortunately I had read up in advance and knew that it was incompatible. HP's website has a list of compatible Bluetooth devices, but T-Mobile doesn't sell any of them. T-Mobile also does not sell the car charger, the spare AC charger, the extended battery, memory cards, etc. Most of these you have to get from HP online, and pay a premium price for them. Forget the camera entirely. It is worthless. I do enjoy being able to download photos from my digital camera, though - it's like having a wallet full of photos to show off to my friends. The Upshot: If you're looking for a gadget that does it all reasonably well, the 6315 is that device. There is lots of room for improvement, and it's possible that the Treo 650 will outpace it in the coming months, and I'm eagerly looking forward to the release of the Flipstart hopefully sometime next year. But at the moment, the 6315 is the best there is, and while some of the problems are annoying, it's worth it to be able to carry a tiny purse again!",neutral,neutral,0.05880267108868759,0.8436839070491136,0.09751342186219879
"I have tried many bluetooth Earphones to use while jogging or driving in autos without dedicated bluetooth A2DP connection capability, and found all of them lacking is something. The Jabra BT-3030 is the best of the lot that I have looked at. Initially I had a little bit of fading in/out while jogging, but that now seems to be solved by keeping the unit well charged and proper positioning of the cell phone and the BT-3030. My primary use has been listening to audio books. The controls are easy to understand and fully functional. It is easy to pause the book when outside (traffic) noise gets too loud and restart after the trucks pass. The volume controls are easy to use to compensate for background noise level changes. The one time that I have received a phone call while listening to the books functioned flawlessly. The book was automatically paused, the call was easy to pick up, caller reported reasonable audio level, and the book automatically restarted when the call was terminated. The included headphones are adequate and the design is perfect for use in a single ear while driving or jogging in a congested area and easily adapts to two ears when you want to immerse yourself in the book. Overall, I highly recommend this system, especially for those who do not like the look of a stick (or ???) stuck to their ear.",positive,positive,0.008362621653916318,0.019172551213596834,0.9724648271324869

"I had to buy a headset due the new California cell phone driving laws. I did some research and decided that the Jawbone was the best, and after owning it and using it quite often for my job, I would have to agree. There is one easily fixable flaw though. The ear pieces and ear hooks are terrible. the fit is never consistent and over time, very painful no mater what combination that you use. I heard from many other reviews with this same problem and many fixed the problem with the Jabra EarGels. I bought a set from Amazon and after sizing myself with the large, the problem was solved. With a half drop of superglue to permanently affix the EarGel to the small plastic piece that the original earpiece was encasing, my Jawbone was perfect. It fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal. I can also wear it all day with no discomfort at all, and wearing your shades isn't a problem anymore either (sunglass temple laying on top of a poor fitting ear hook really sucks). With this tiny fix, you will definitely have the best looking, best performing, and best fitting bluetooth headset out there. I hope you enjoy it!

"The idea of this Bluetooth headset is a good one however I had some problems with the voice commands capability. On more than one occasion in a months time, it stopped recognizing any voice commends (like 'dial voicemail' 'call back' etc). I had to power it off and back on a couple of times to get it to work again. I also thought the caller id announce would be nice, but in practice, it only works if you wear the headset all the time. If you are not wearing it and miss the caller id announce, but put it in your ear as the phone is ringing and press the button to answer the call, it only works about half of the time. I actually missed several calls and had to call people back due to this. Also, I find that I like to just put the headset on when I need to make or receive a call and then take it off. For this, I feel that the Plantronics 925 is a better choice since it's a bit easier to put in my ear and take off and it comes with a nice charging case for storage. With the BlueAnt, I always had trouble figuring out where to put it when not in use. Also, on the BlueAnt, callers said I sounded more muffled than on the Plantronics although they could hear less background noise. In practice, noise cancellation isn't really a big deal because I find that I would rather make a call in a semi-quiet environment anyway. If I'm in my car, I just roll the windows up, no big deal. I ended up returning this headset mainly due to the reliability issue. The fact that my voice didn't sound as good as other Bluetooth headsets was also a deal breaker for me.

"I recently purchased the V600 Motorola phone and the Jabra BT250 Bluetooth headset through Cingular. The phone itself is quite cool. Cingular service in New Jersey and Texas, however, has been very spotty. The Jabra headset and/or V600 have not been worth the trouble. When the combination works, it's very nice. However, I frequently lose the pairing between the two and have to take the SIMM card out of the phone and re-charge the headset (basically re-booting both of them).

"This product has been discontinued by the manufacturer and after using it its obvious to see why.

Also, I did not find it as simple to use as the ad sounds, and basically had to start from scratch at the beginning of each song. I have a newer, 160G model ipod, and it would not work with it, which I found surprising since I have never had any compatibility issues before.

"Nice phone, especially the automatic voice feature that does not need training... works right away ... My complaints are in 2 areas detailed below. First for those who want to transfer contacts from another phone, PDA or from Outlook. And second that Verizon has had LG remove file transfer features that forces user to pay for MIDIs and MP3 that are already on your PC, just to use up your air time (= money!) 1. The Manual mentions a USB cable once. 2. LG's website mentions no such device, nor drivers, for any CDMA phone. Search engine produces no results. 3rd party cable exists but advertises 'no drivers, no software' 3. No infrared, no bluetooth (of course not for the price) 4. Can send but NOT receive text message / MMS in which you include addresses from your competitive phone. (This feature exists in Nokia, Siemens, even the oldest black/white Nokias!) 5. Has neat music tunes (polyphone MIDIs) that you can ONLY send to others, but not set as ringtones. I guess you may send it to yourself, and charge yourself for airtime!! Is that extortion? Conclusion: A. camera and hot pix are features that encourage you to share wirelessly and consume airtime for Verizon's profits. B. This may reveal a deeper strategy of Verizon and LG to remove technology to force user to spend needlessly C. Suggest ""googling"" (or searc CNET) to corroborate other rumors that Verizon makes use use airtime for reading text message and partially disables bluetooth for file management to force you to pay for data transfers. D. With Nokia, Siemens and others you can transfer WAV, MIDIs, and MP4 files from your PC for ringtones via an accessory cable, or if enabled, via Infrared and/or Bluetooth, and MMS. There may be a removable multimedia card feature on LG's 8100 or later phones that MAY enable some of these features, but I hope this helps avoid the wasted moves I had to make.",negative,neutral,0.2791268101876746,0.5839329817545968,0.13694020805772855

"The good: Nice sounding unit, with decent pseudo-full-duplex ability (sorry, it's not real full duplex, most speakerphone technology is not due to the complexity of creating digital ""hybrid"" duplexing networks, but it's good none the less). Get the mic as close as possible to your head for maximum effectiveness. Ergonomics are good, operation is intuitive and easy. Plumbing your handsfree kit through the car stereo is the only way to go, like this kit does. But that can involve a fair amount of wiring, so if there is a wiring harness available for your car, consider it money well spent. Works well with my HTC Touch phone. Since using a touch screen phone while driving down the highway is the epitome of a Bad Idea, having the Touch play well with the Parrot is a nice thing. The bad: Works really badly with my LG UX8350 flip phone, to the point of not usable. The Parrot incessantly beeps and continuously makes odd noises after one makes a call with this phone. I must shut off Bluetooth to make it shut up. Tried various suggestions from the Parrot tech support folk, with no improvement. The ugly: Updating the firmware in the Parrot is a maddening experience, combining the worst of Bluetooth, Windows, and voodoo magic. Version numbers of their firmware run bass-awkwards, so forget using any sort of logic to decide which firmware version you should be using. The dealer didn't have the appropriate cable to perform firmware updates, which struck me as both the logical way to perform an update as well as something basic a dealer just might have. This of course was precipitated by the problems with the UX8350, which culminated in Parrot's tech support telling me that I was LYING about implementing their recommendations (I'm not being hyperbolic here: they really did accuse me of not performing their very simple yet ineffective suggestions). Uh, okay. Didn't mean to offend the Parrot gods! Summary: Decent widget, assuming it works properly with your phone. Research on the web regarding your particular phone before purchasing.

"The sound quality on this phone is excellent. It's far better than any land line I've ever used. Communication between two RAZR phone's are crystal clear. I love the sound quality. This phone is also a great phone for doing just about everything you could possibly think of on a phone. In conjunction with the $30 functionality software for integrating with the PC, you can make your own ring tones, manage files, add personalized photo's, etc. However, there is a problem with this phone that makes me a little nutty. The software on this phone has a memory leak. If the phone is left 'on' in the on position, ie the phone is on but in the 'hibernate' mode, and not shut down via the red power button, the phone will take on a behavior all it's own.

I've noticed several times where the phone would not follow commands from buttons properly, or, the volume chooser will go up and down and up and down on it's own. In every instance just 'shutting down' the phone didn't resolve the problem. The phone needed to be shut down for 5 minutes or more, an irritation for sure. I'd say that the development staff for the software on this computer need to perform further testing when the phone is left on all of the time.",positive,neutral,0.18422266528210812,0.6199985034997775,0.1957788312181143

"Okay, well I just got my second razor yesterday and Ive only has this for 8 days.

So I really got mad and returned the phone yesterday, but since I got locked into taht 2 year contract thing, I had to just get a replacement. So I got a replacement, and the battery is amazing now(i only got 7 hours at the most out of my phone) and the texting is fine now, but now, it doesnt let me know when I get a new voicemail. I have to go and check my voicemail every 5 minutes to see if I have a new one. It is soo annyoing. I am never buying a razor ever again! It is the worst phone EVER!

"What a pain. Every time I turned on the Motorola W370 from the time I turn it on to the time it finds the network no matter where I am, it takes a good 1 minute 45 seconds! It never got better - no matter when or where I turned it on, it would take that long before I could make a call. I cannot live with that and complained and complained to Tracfone. Yesterday, after nearly a month going back and forth, I finally was okayed for the option of changing to a comparable phone with them. I had even replaced the SIM card that they sent, but that did not work. They finally concluded that even though this phone is recommended for my zip code, that it just does not work well for me in this zip code. I haven't decided which phone to get yet - they offered the LG225 or the Motorola W376g. Who knows if the same problem would happen again - I hope not! I would still be using my old Tracfone (Motorola 120 - no SIM card), old-fashioned, but the antenna fell after 3 years of use, no idea where all the parts went. Tracfone no longer supported that model so it was put to rest. But what a fantastic phone for me - never had a problem with it and it was a rebuilt one and free with the units I bought. As soon as I turned it on the network came right in. I haven't moved so it is strange that the Motorola W370 takes as long as it does to find the network. This is NOT normal. Otherwise the W370 was fine but I only use my cell phone to call out from when I am not home, but generally I am home. Be so glad when this whole affair is finished.

"This is a nicely styled, sleek, minimalist Stand for the Apple iWatch. It's nicely done in an angled silvery Aluminum with a brushed finish. This looks great, and exactly as it does in the Amazon photos. Be aware, though, this is JUST the physical metal stand.

"Cons: Sluggish. Hangs every now and then. Video (movies) does not play for more than 10-15 min after that the sound comes but the screen freeze. Even after Xenon flash indoor shoots are hazy. The hands free is weird, it has a button to disconnect but it does not redial the last number. Also the disconnect button location inadvertently disconnects the call in the middle of conversation. Pros: Almost everything in a phone. GPS works fine, only time to first connect is long but after that it quickly links and works fine. WLAN connects faster. Camera for all cell phone standard is extremely good, I used it on a trip and I am happy with the results. Speakers are good quality Overall I would recommend this phone but keep in mind that it won't do things as fast as you would like it to perform. Forget about watching video as they play only for 10-15 min.

"The last PCS cell phone I owned was the venerable SCP-8100 from Sanyo. It was a cute little phone that was the second cell phone from any U.S. carrier that could take pictures. (The first-ever model was the SCP-5300 also from Sanyo, released in July 2002.) The PM-8200 addressed two shortcoming of the 8100: 1) camera quality, and 2) speakerphone. The 8200 sports a higher-resolution built-in camera. Picture quality is also improved. The old 8100's pictures often had streaks and distorted colors. The 8200's pictures look much better. The speakerphone is definitely a great addition for those of us who like to multi-task yet dislike headsets. The volume and clarity could be a little better, but given the compact size of this phone, it's not bad. Reception on the 8200 is great, thanks to its external antenna. Battery life is good, unless you save a lot of things in memory, which depletes battery faster the more stuff it holds. The phone is attractive and can be customized in many ways, not to mention it comes in three colors. To Sanyo, I suggest you use the iPod Mini color scheme, because not many people like big red! In summary, the 8200 delivers lots of improvements over the already-excellent 8100. If you have Sprint or plan to get Sprint, this is the phone. If you want video recording, check out the Toshiba phone for Sprint.",positive,positive,0.012858809537064374,0.3289445307272311,0.6581966597357045

"Very good audio reception and transmission, even in noisy areas. You have to insert an earpiece into the ear which takes getting used to but you eventually do. It does bring three earpieces and can try each one to see which one suits you best. It is a larger unit compared to a smaller bluetooth such as the Motorola HS820. The on/off button is separate from the call button and are both easily accessible. You can turn off the light that indicates the unit is on and/or in use. The unit may be used on the right or left ear. It seats relatively well on the ear and the earpiece helps it stay in place. I bought the unit for its promise of very good audio reception and transmission and it has delivered on both. Update(12/2009): Battery charge lasts for days with heavy use, longer with light use. I just bought another headset because the original I bought two years ago got washed in the washing machine and ceased functioning (so make sure not to place the headset in your pocket).",positive,positive,0.08747432300222441,0.25148272898515855,0.6610429480126171

However, it's sound quality is not as good and it does have challenges iin pairing and transferring the address book.

"For some reason Verizon won't show my review for this phone after trying twice so I don't know if it's a glitch I hit or a nerve. This is what I said in my review: I'm a simple girl. Give me my phone. Throw in a cam and text messaging and I'm good. I couldn't care less about other features and will give a review based on common sense in comparison to what other people rate about. For one, people list QWERTY as a pro. Nooo really? And they list how battery life is poor. No it's not in fact I wish this battery came on more phones. If you're going to treat your phone as a freakin computer, of course the battery is going to die. Sometimes people complain of the camera having no flash. Photography 101...natural light is best light so if you're lighting sucks, so will the pic and artificial lights like the flash actually make your image worse. Now down to business. I love this battery because it lasts long and you can leave it in its charger without worrying if the battery will be overcharged. I don't have to delete old texts either for a very long time which was a problem on previous phones but I'm not a text fiend so maybe don't go by me. This was actually replaced at day 1 because the first env2i got kept shutting off. The ones my friends have also broke and are barely a year old. People complain I sound muffled which was NEVER an issue before with my samsung phones. With my current phone, I talk to my friend who still has her Env2 and I could hear the difference in clarity. My service keeps getting dropped in my room which never used to happen, especially when sitting by a window yet. And the key lock is useless. It unlocks in my pocket and apparently my pants end up calling my friends by accident. I always had basic flip phones so this was never an issue before. I wouldn't pay the going price for it and I almost regret even paying the little I did. It's not worth it and now I do my research online before buying a phone. I've never gone wrong with a Samsung yet (knock on wood) and will stick with them in the future. Nokia and Sony Ericson are supposed to be good as well but I haven't personally tried Sony and Nokia phones from Verizon seem to get rated very poorly I noticed.

"Pros: This is a great bluetooth if you want stereo for music or for conversations in loud places. Whenever I had trouble hearing I use both buds. It blocks out background sound so I can hear fine and the mic is so good it only picks up my voice (as long as the volume isn't set too loud). Worst case in really loud environments I have to hold the mic near my mouth. Sometimes I use it at work just to block out loud sounds. Works just as goood as the earplugs we use hear and Thy're easier to put on and take off. It's great for me because I don't like to walk around with a device in my ear or have to explain to people that I'm on the phone and not talking to them. Also, If your driving you don't have to fumble around to look for it because it just hangs on your neck. Works great with my Sony Ericson W580i and my bluetooth laptop. It accesses phone contact book and recent calls or music playing. Displays time too. One button music play, one button phone answer with caller ID. name shows just like you have it saved on your phone. Cons: It would be nice if I could plug in another set of head phones. Actually I really want to plug into my home theater so I can remotely send the music from my phone. Overall: Great product. Already bought a second one.

"I live in a major metropolitan area, surrounded by cell towers. But my home is at the bottom of the hill, and I've always had problems with cell phone reception. It's very common to see me or one of my neighbors outside talking on the phone, trying to find better reception. No more. The installation instructions on this device are pretty demanding. So I wanted to test it out before I installed it, to make sure that it worked. Installation does require a penetration through your house for the coax cable. This wasn't quite clear in the instructions or the description. Cell phone coverage at home is now a necessity for me, because I'm running my business out of my house. In fact, my office is in the basement, where the reception is the worst. So it was either find better reception or rent an office. in my test installation, I just kind of toss the antenna onto the roof. So it was facing more up than towards any cell tower. When the correct cable through an open doorway, plugged everything in, and viola: 3 bars instead of 0 or 1. Fantastic call clarity. I've now made a more permanent installation, with the receiver antenna aimed per the instructions. Now I have 4 bars! I would say this is a fantastic device for improving cell phone reception in urban areas.",positive,positive,0.03618888881001825,0.06567335289369527,0.8981377582962864

Still - there's always something about these fussy little wire connections that mean even fussier, even tinier little soldered connections - ""THE WEAKEST LINK"" somewhere in the chain. I was thrilled to see the type of cordage connection incorporated in this device; figured this might take me past the cursory 30 day limit I get from most wired acoustics toys. Imagine my frustration when I lost ear bud attached stereo in just over a WEEK! Folks, I'm wheelchair bound and not particularly rough with my goodies yo; NOW - figure out where my head went when AMAZON decided my ONLY RECOURSE was to get a full refund, 5 weeks after a return of the item and needing to hoop dance to purchase the ink to create the barcode for shipping, yada yada, blah blah... SAVING GRACE? The PLANTRONICS TECH C/S PEEPS themselves (late on a Sunday evening no less)! Apparently the lonely dude operating the latte machine that night was in a congenial mood; for a swap out - of my original Amazing Amazon Attachment to an email - I've been sent one each replacement wired ear bud stereo connecter! HOW SWEET is that story! Now, for a REVIEW of the actual device: Sturdily packaged ez to read and assimilate instruction manual, all pieces separately packed, zip-lock baggie for the ear-gels, nothing drops to the floor when you dive in; it's an ez ensemble to assemble. Sound is straight up NICE! I have nothing thin or tinny; mine was a straight up bass bumpin playa. Even with the loss of volume adjustment in the attached stereo bud NOW, it's every bit as good as a mid volume rig. Pairing was a snap, instant location and match up with my Moto Q 9C, no sweat. Only complaint is my actual listening time on a full charge is running out at about 4.5 hours. THAT'S why I'm back to treat myself to another! This time - I located extra stereo connection buds 1st (on the BAY, eh), right at 4 bux a pop (ordered two), then I came slidin back in here - to see the price has risen 10 smackers since just 2 weeks back when I made my first purchase. Why does a guy need this amount of non stop music?

"I researched myself to death weighing the options between a new wireless headset for a perfectly good home office landline phone (between $225 & $270) or a whole new phone with Bluetooth syncing. Loved the idea of getting one that would merge the iPhone (half of my calls come in on) and the land line (other half come in on). Seven grey hairs later I decided on Plantronics Calisto Pro. Every review on Amazon and elsewhere were read, condsidered, manufacturer websites researched and Big Box stores visited. In the end I opted to for the Calisto Pro. First to Mac users, go to the website. The software updates are there so the anti-Mac reviews are outdated or under researched. For those who wrote it's difficult to put the headset into the charger...you need to gently push the headset in making sure the ear loop rests in the indentation until you hear a click. It sets in securely. No tapping needed. Now if you remove the handset or headset and put them back in both will start to charge again. Initial appearances (charge battery icon on the handset and red light on the headset) make it look as if neither has fully charged. They have. 3 hours for the headset and just over 15 hours until the handset said it was charged. Handset is light. Some have called it 'cheap' feeling. My only 'cheap' feel is the light tension spring on the belt clip. Then again it's not designed for sweat pants... It's very nice to be able to sync my Outlook contacts. Make sure they are nice and neat killing duplicates or seperate entries for the same person. You have 200 contacts and each contact can have up to 3 numbers. The program allows you to check off which ones you want to sync with the phone which is a nice option. I didn't need the pet sitter on the Calisto for example. I agree the buttons are on the small side and I have small hands. Not as much of importance to me as is extremely clear speaker phone, mobility (no longer teathered to the phone!!) and a comfortable headset all of which syncs with the iPhone 3G seamlessly. Regarding the speakerphone on hand and head set...I hear with perfect clarity on both with volume adjustment being independent. Callers state they can hear me perfectly either source but state the headset sounds as if I were in the same room. My home is a Wi-Fi zoo. There are more waves bouncing off of walls than Carters makes liver pills! That being said the majority of signals on all devices are 'very good' unless you're sitting on a router. My microwave killed calls on a different cordless before. There were no interruptions on any calls. I noted a hum on my end but callers heard nothing and if I weren't in 'test mode' and searching for things wrong with the performance I probably wouldn't have noticed. Note: this is with the volume up high. My personal preference is to set on high & I'll probably pay for in later years, but I like my phone calls up high to not miss a word. Note on the syncing of the headset...turn off the headset, then turn on when the phone is in search mode. Instructions give the impression you should wait for the cell to find the headset but move to the next step and you'll sync ASAP. The unit comes with a very limited quick start guide. This phone can do MUCH more than it first looks like. PRINT THE 61 PAGE GUIDE FROM PLANTRONICS WEBSITE!! Tons of helpful info and Plantronics does have a great support site and help system. Easy screen menu...perhaps a little antiquated in apperance but clear and functional. I like the calls answered//missed/dialed feature. How many times have you made a call and need to re-dial that number 5 calls later but can't? This unit lets you see them all. The phone book search has shortcuts...again print the guide off of the website. Agreed no phone is perfect. Like building your own home even if you think you thought of everyting you'll find something missing eventually. This phone could benefit from either larger or rubberized buttons for folks with larger fingers or long nails, but if you want ONE home/home office unit with complete mobility (no 4' wired cord) which syncs seamlessly with your cell on one bluetooth headset this is it.",positive,neutral,0.11430416281449336,0.5258280612451466,0.35986777594036007

"I bought this earpiece a month ago to go with my brand new Nextel i870. It worked sorta ok but was a bit finiky when used with my phone in my belt holder. I didn't wear it all the time, just when I was commuting to and from work. I kept it in my pocket so it would be on standby, in contact with my phone. Most times, it would connect quickly and function well. Ocassionally, it would seem to connect, but when I attempted an outgoing call, it would disconnect. I also had trouble hearing the unit while driving. As I am approaching my mid 50's, my hearing is not as acute as in past years, and the internal noise from the pickup truck (windows up, and AC running) makes hearing the other party on the earpiece difficult. My main problem with this unit is the recharge plug. I have 3 Nextel/Motorola phones that use this type of plug and have not had any trouble with it. The plug end has a release button to depress when unplugging. The catch on my HS850 charger plug was more difficult to release and required much more pressure to release than my other 2 Motorola charger plugs of the same type. This contributed to undue stress on the socket and eventually the socket pulled loose. I probably charged it 6-7 times over the month I had it. I intend to replace my HS850 with some other type that has an earpiece that fits in my ear, providing some sound isolation from environmental noises, rather than the lay on this ear type. Be careful unplugging this unit from its charging plug.",neutral,neutral,0.056416672633749984,0.7570281504151382,0.18655517695111187
"I bought this for my wife. She tried it for a couple of weeks but switched to a blue tooth headset. I then tried it for a few weeks. It was too large to fit on the driver's side visor and permit me to flip the visor all the way down to block the sun. I then moved it to the passenger's side visor where it was excellent for listening to calls but the people with whom I was speaking said they could not hear me. Also, the noise of the air conditioner (even on low) made it so the person with whom I was speaking could not hear me at all. I then started holding it in my hand when I was using it -- which completely defeats the unit's hands-free purpose. Finally, I gave up.

The unit seems to work better than the Motorola 500 and 700 that it replaced. BUT it is too heavy and it is really difficult to switch calls (call waiting) and hurts your ear more to wear than the Motorola. The additional thing that is better for the Motorola is a positive off switch by folding the microphone. Both Motorola's died and so far the Plantronics seem to be more trouble free.

"I really want to like this headset. The battery life is excellent, the Bluetooth performance is outstandingly good, with excellent range and good performance no matter where I put my phone on my person. The main feature -- the noise cancelation -- works as advertised. Callers say I come through very clearly, even if there's significant background noise. Now for the reasons I'm returning it: 1) The headset is *extremely* sensitive to wind. In conditions where other headsets I've used (Treo, B&O EarSet 2) would pick up a little wind but remain usable, the Jawbone is unusable. People on the other end ask me to call them back or hang up because the wind noise is so loud and they can't understand what I'm saying. I don't know for certain, but I suspect that the fancy enclosure with all its holes is at fault, since it can pick up wind from almost any direction. 2) Incoming voice quality is poor. People to whom I'm speaking sound to me like pale renditions of their natural voices. Somewhat tinny and one-dimensional. And, the only time I've ever noticed the Jawbone's supposed automatic boost in incoming volume happen is when there's so much wind noise that the other person can't hear me. 3) Fit is extremely difficult. The ear loop mechanism includes a clever little spring system that is intended, I suppose, to ensure that the contact microphone stays against your cheek. However, I found that it tended to act to lever the earpiece out of my ear, so that the already-tinny sound quality became even worse. This is in stark contrast to the B&O, whose adjustability and fit are spectacular. 4) Non-standard charging cable is annoying and inconvenient. I wish they had just used a mini-USB cable like a number of other headsets are using. I already carry such a cable with me in my bag, so I would always be equipped for a charge. Long story short: what I really need is a headset that will work in normal conditions. Military noise cancelation technology that will allow me to stand right in front of a boom box and have the person on the other end hear almost nothing but my own voice is very neat. However, if that same person can't stand to speak to me while I walk from my car into a store in a breeze, then the headset is useless. I hope that Aliph will make a new generation product that addresses my issues above.",neutral,neutral,0.12142275117085705,0.8409363731373751,0.0376408756917678

"This headset is definitely good looking and great sounding, however it has several fatal flaws. First is the awful design of the charger. The headset does not click into the charger, it just sits there so you have no idea if the headset light is off because it is fully charged or because the headset is not connected to the charger. Plantronics gives you adaptors for chargers of most popular cell phone brands, but that does not solve the design problem. My second issue is the poor fit of the headset. It is supposed to be held on by a gel earpiece. None of the earpieces fit me well. At one point, while wearing it in the car, the headset flew out of my ear and landed somewhere in the back seat. There is a loop you can add to secure the headset, however the loop makes the headset much less comfortable to wear. This means you have to periodically take the headset off to give your ear a break. This brings up the third flaw. The way that you switch the headset from one ear to the other is to turn the gel earpiece 90 degrees. The problem is that the way to remove the earpiece is to move it to the center position (45 degrees). I often had the earpiece pop out as I took the headset out to put it on or as I took it out of my pocket. My last issue with this headset is that there is no way to carry it with you. Some headsets come with a loop to hang it around your neck, others are comfortable enough to wear all the time. This one is neither. You could try to carry the headset in its charger but that is not a good idea either. Even though the charger has a clip to put in on your pocket like a pen, the headset does not sit securely on the charger, it can easily fall out as you lean over. Besides the charger is bulky, as thick as a magic marker and not convenient or comfortable to wear. The sound and the looks of this headset are excellent, but unfortunately they don't overcome the fatal flaws of the design.",negative,neutral,0.2646490657959602,0.7288878804892633,0.006463053714776489

"I purchased the 250 device for my new Treo 650. I am very disappointed and will be packing it up to send back (the Jabra...not the Treo). I've tried it for a week and can't take it anymore. The only PRO I can think of is that it is light and comfortable. I do have a lot of CONS: 1. Range is supposed to be 15 feet. Yeah right...try less than 5 feet. 2. If you have the phone on one side of your body (i.e. in a belt clip) with the headset on the other side, it simply does not work. I don't mean it sort of doesn't work, I mean it doesn't work at all--every time. 3. When I have everything in order for it to work properly (i.e. the headset is within 2 feet of my phone on the same side of my body), the reception is spotty at best. Time and again, the person on the other end of the phone asks me if I am in a wind tunnel. At other times, they tell me that I'm fading in and out. 4. About 30% of the time, the Jabra does not realize my Treo has rung. So, I end up having to not use it. 5. When the Jabra does realize my Treo as rung, it takes about 5 seconds for it to realize this. As such, the Treo continues to ring. This causes me to fret...should I wait for the Jabra to realize my treo is ringing and risk losing the call to my voicemail? Or should I answer the phone. If I answer the phone prematurely (i.e. before the Jabra realizes it has rung), it takes about 3 seconds for the Jabra to connect. During this time, the person on the other end is talking and I can't hear. All in all, I considered giving this product a one-star rating.

I was very excited about the prospect of owning a smartphone. This phone has proved unreliable. It requires frequent resets to work. Often simply moving to vibrate mode is enough to make the features not function properly. The phone is not useful. The processor is very slow.

"First off, the headset is only $20 if purchased with a Sony Ericsson T610. For that much, this is a must buy. The concept is wonderful, and it works well for the most part. I can speak wirelessly with my phone elsewhere. The headset itself is comfortable - especially the eargel. It fits snugly and sound is clear. Two gripes, however: 1) Battery life is less than impressive. Jabra claims 3 hrs. I have yet to get beyond 2. In fact, last night when I used it, I got a warning signal at exactly 1:51. 2) Bluetooth range is 30 feet only when in a clear path. My bathroom is 15 feet away. I get noticeable static on my end. If I close the door, everything becomes unintelligble. The interesting thing is that the person on the other end doesn't seem to notice a thing.

"CONS: I have been in circles with T-mobile over this phone since January. I am on my FOURTH Nokia 6133 since January and have had similar problems with all the phones. The phone has problems with reception and that causes an echo-y, Darth Vader, Chipmunk, Windtunnel sound for both caller and call receiver. I have been told everything by T-mobile that it is my account, the tower, the phone, the antenna, but all I know is that every 6th phone call will result in TERRIBLE sound quality. I have also experienced an occasional problem with both text and picture messages locking up the phone (which is a known error in the phone) The camera button goes off all the time. Speakerphone is almost useless. Battery life is not as good as advertised. I need to recharge everyday. PROS: Love the button to press to flip the phone. Phone layout is great.

"This headset works exactly as advertised. It sits in my ear and it cancels an almost unbelievable amount of noise. When I first got it I used it while driving 75 mph on a highway, with the air conditioning on, with all my windows open, listening to loud death metal. My friend on the other end had no idea. He said it sounded like I was holding the phone to my ear in a quiet room. The headset has a long standby time and a very good amount of talk time. I use it mainly for business, and therefore use it every day, and several times a week I have hours-long telephone meetings. The battery never runs out on me unless I don't charge it for a day or two. Most times I can get by charging it every other day. Another nice thing is that most of the time charging it only takes twenty minutes or half an hour, and I can charge it from any USB port. I am connecting it to an iPhone 3G, and I have had no connection issues there. I also used it for about a week with the original iPhone, and also had no issues. So, perfect call quality, long battery life, no Bluetooth connection issues. Why the three stars? Well, like many, many other people on here, I have to point out that the included accessories to fit the headset in your ear just do not work. Based on reviews I read here, I ordered a pack of Jabra Ear Gels at the same time as the headset, and I'm really glad I did. I tried all the combinations of the included accessories, and could find nothing that came even remotely close to fitting my head. With the Jabras, it fits fine. I use it without an earstrap, and am never nervous about it falling out. If Jawbone had included some with the headset, I'd give it 5 stars, no question. Because it requires an additional product, it loses 2 stars. It would be more, but this is an Amazon review, and the ear gels are linked right from this page, so it's not like they're hard to find.",neutral,positive,0.06775717597136019,0.23297359233979786,0.6992692316888419

"Nothing in the product description prepared me for the surprise of finding that this product is a ""Communication Set for Her."" It comes complete with a pink earbud, and the packaging is rife with gender specific marketing cues, all of which have been curiously and misleadingly eliminated from the Amazon materials, yes I went I back and looked. I guess the little design highlight curlicues on the silver body may have been a clue, but they are much more prominent on the actual unit than in the picture. The unit itself is also curious. It comes with a ridiculous charging case so that is an extra thing that you are going to have to take with you when you travel, and the charger itself is gigantuan. So to be clear, there is no way to charge this thing without the superfluous case. One more thing to carry, break, or lose. Too much junk to keep track of. It also comes with a bunch of adapters for foreign power supplies. How strange. And a nice silver cloth pouch with matching design curlicues. And a great big full booklet manual with super tiny print. The unit works passably well for one without noise reduction.

"I would like to give this phone a five star rating but there are a few concerns that I wrote as follows that makes this phone less than ""perfect"": 1. The slider screen is shaky and not built solid enough. For all the features and applications that come with it I would expect a more sturdy hardware. If the phone slider is in original (closed) position and it is shaken very lightly you can feel the screen is loose. Not expected this from Nokia. I am going to exchange it with another one and hope that it was just the one I got and not a problem with all of them. 2. The software that the phone comes with is a little slow and even slower to update the software using a Windows XP computer. I am usually very good with hooking up peripherals to my computer but it took me almost an hour to just update the software from the computer. Kept giving me a ""Firewall"" error, disabled all firewalls, then download the update and kept giving me a ""no NOL"" or something error and just on a random try worked and took around 20 minutes just to update the software. However, I can deal with that I guess since it is not an everyday thing. 3. 2.8"" Screen is big but not big enough to fully enjoy all the cool features it has. I have a 20x20 but still had to strain my eyes on some videos and websites. The zoom features is good but then most of the webpage goes out of field of view. But then again This is what makes it really cool looking and not big and ugly as other phones with some of its features. Overall, I still like the phone and agree with all the good reviews given. I decide to keep it if the the screen thing is good with the replacement. Screen being loose is my biggest concern which is not good for a new phone and gives it a non-expensive phone feel.

"I got this phone as an upgrade to my old V300 model via T-Mobile about six months from the day this review was made. There are some things about the V330 that are better and worse than my old V300. For openers, the good things are that Motorola caught on to some of the quick key innovations that Samsung conceived for their phone brands available to Sprint customers: quick keys to access T-Zones and the camera are the two most prominent. Also, the V330 has Bluetooth capability, which I can't comment on since I don't have a wireless headset to take advantage of this feature. Those are the advantages to the V330 over the V300. My disappointments with this phone compared to the V300 is that whenever I am reading or writing a text message, it is interrupted whenever new ones come in. I never had that problem with the V300, and Motorola needs to work out that issue with all their current and future models immediately. Of course, the only application that incoming SMS and MMS messages will not interrupt is use of Java-based gaming applications. Also, whenever several text messages come in, or even at unexpected times, outgoing text messages will not transmit to the recipients; the phone has to be turned off and back on, and then each outgoing message has to be manually resent. This too is extremely inconvenient, and is yet another issue Motorola needs to immediately resolve; otherwise, I may go back to buying Sony Erricson phones as I have never had such problems with their earlier models. Overall, the phone is decent. It is not superb. It will be once the recommended improvements are made.",negative,neutral,0.16662614930802327,0.7392688129867642,0.09410503770521265
"This is just a great deal. These are the same exact battery strips you see hanging on the rack at your local battery store. For less than what they charge for 1, you get a strip of 5. Unfortunately, you can't just buy 1 for 1/5 the price, so if you don't need all 5, you'll end up wasting batteries over time. I decided to get a full strip since I have a bunch of quartz watches, and this is a fairly common size. I'll probably use 3-4 before they all go dead. Seller ships quickly, but there is no tracking ability, and they ship the battery strip in a standard letter-size envelope.",positive,positive,0.1487461686409098,0.3771986794203192,0.4740551519387711
"I purchased this phone as a upgrade when I had been with the world's best wireless provider (T-Mobile) for a year (YAY ME!). Initially I was so in love with the phone itself since the phone I had before it was a dinosaur to me- the Samsung R225. A few weeks after I purchased it, the initial infactuation wore off and it was a regular, old, fat phone which is actually one of the first things people delight in telling me when they see it! ""WOW! What a HUGE phone!"" ""I've never seen a phone that big!"" ""It looks like a remote!"". While I do hate attention it brings, I sometimes secretly enjoy the perks of this phone-like the camera (both reg. and video), high-quality color screen, the real one player, as well as its uniqueness (is that a word?). There are a lot of cool tricked out things to do with the phone as well, as far as faceplates, flashing what-nots, etc. but who would want to bring attention to this phone. I am currently showcasing this ""UCO- Unidentified Cellular Object"" in a delightful magenta faceplate that allows it to play nice and fit in well with the other phones on the playground. A word to the wise: Don't get sucked in by it's witty features and convinience- be prepared to deal with the unending taunts, compliments, questions, and awkward stares of those who want to know more but are afraid that your monster of a phone will bite their head off mid-sentence! For those of you who choose to purchase this delightful piece of machinery-make sure you make your decision to return it within the 14 day trial period!",neutral,positive,0.12365854254204169,0.29357023400166354,0.5827712234562948

"After reading the other reviews I had to write one, cuz I have mixed feelings about the phone. Having used pocket pcs in the past I am biased because of the wonderful things WiFi brings to this phone. Truly. I agree with comments about phone functionality. I have trouble hearing at times. Ring is too quiet. Works great with the earpiece but when you try to end the call with the earpiece, an Incall results almost all the time. So end your calls with the red button, please. Speakerphone only for quiet places. And always always shut off the pda when you holster it because the phone constantly redials the last number you called. Diligence and diligence alone can prevent the embarrassment of being overheard by someone you just talked to. I love the keyboard. My kids love the keyboard. My wife loves the keyboard. Great functionality for texting and Email. Especially with WIFI. Get Opera for mobile phone. Works great with this phone and can surf for free at hotspots. Check stocks etc etc. It really improves the functionality. Great for games and compose thoughts, calendar, todo list, as with PPC. Great for [...] - listen to books and music. Great for downloading with WIFI - again improves functionality. Great device for traveling and waiting... pull it out and do things. The battery - get a second and keep it in your pocket. Works for me. I rarely need it as I charge all the time, in car, on PC, Wall socket. Just really not an issue for me. Bulky and holstering is a pain. But that seems to be part of the deal. Lots of brains in this device, can be fun if you are patient. But the phone as a phone is a bugger at times.

"A nice looking phone for a cheapie, fairly easy to use (with some odd quirks, I'm used to Nokias and Samsungs), with basic features that are enough for those who mostly want to make phone calls. The organizer works well and it's nice to be able to send text messages to multiple numbers, but the phone does have the annoying Motorola trait of only having one number per name entry. However, the v188 failed at even being a basic phone for me, as reception was notably worse than my Samsung X105 (which I've just gone back to after a few months of using the v188), and it got especially horrible when friends who also had T-Mobile picked up Motorola V330s.

I've owned this cell for about 9 months so far. In that time I've exchanged it 4 times. The first 3 had to be exchanged for software issues. The 4th time something wacky happened when I used it with my iBook and I did not disconnect it properly. I went back and Verizon gave me a refurbished model (like the other 3 times). This cell will not do any file transfering by BT so that is a huge downfall. Its almost useless. Since this was the only Verizon BT cell I bought it. But in the end i wish I did not. The cell got a huge hype and it was all for nothing. Camera is useless as it takes sub-par pics. I've seen Samsung's do better than this. The screen however is nice and crisp. I also noticed that the cell scuffs really bad at the high points (where it opens/closes) but there is nothing you can do about that since you gotta open and close it. I think Motorola missed the mark on this model. overall its a decent cell but don't expect it to do much. for the money its not worth it. i wished i had waited - oh well at least its decent.,neutral,neutral,0.39096940980505324,0.6039120156005684,0.005118574594378389

This thing works very Well with Verizon cell phones. I like it very much and it is worth every penny. However it does not work that well with Sprint. At least not when Driving down the Freeway. IT could be that it works well on Sprint IF are in a week signal area. Now. I am not sure if the sprint problem is due to Wilson or Sprint. It could be that sprint does not have a good switching system when at high speed on the freeway. Thus the reason for Dropped Calls. So I can not at this time blaime Wilson. One other thing that bothers me. none of the Wilson systems support WiMax. WiMax is part of the Cell System now. A big part of the Cell System. Wilson should add support for WiMax as that is how Sprint does 4G as does Clear and other Data and Data Cell systems. Also it still supports AMPs analog signals. This was a technology that was turned off Feb 28 2009. So I would think Wilson would want to update these AMPs. But then again with the economy due mostly in my opinion to the current idiot in the white house they may not have the sales thus the $ to develop the changes. Also we all heard the BS the FCC is doing to try and It would seem decide that the airwaves belong to the government and not to you and I. So this may not be the foult of wilson as well. I know and have worked with the FCC and they were jerks 25 years ago and have gotton worce in the laat 25 years and certainly since The idiot in the white house too over and does not seem to realze we need a good leadar. We do NOT need a dictator. But he seems to think he is as does the current head of the FCC.

"The battery itself is fantastic and provides hours of extra iPhone life when you are on the go and can't be near an outlet. As any iPhone user knows, this is a must. The only trouble is that the cord it comes with does not fit tightly into the charging port on the iPhone. Thus, the only way to charge using this battery is to plug it in and leave it sitting untouched on a surface where it won't be joggled or moved. The slightest movement of the phone, or trying to actually USE it while charging, dislodges the charging cord. This is a big problem for girls carrying the battery and phone in their purses. There is no way to charge the phone inside your purse - the minute you pick up your purse and start walking, the cord will dislodge and the charging will cease. As an alternative, you can use the USB cord that came with your iPhone for this battery - it will work fine. But most of us use that for home charging and iTunes updates - it's up to you if you want that to become a portable item. The company that sells these batteries is top notch with terrific customer service. Very responsive and concerned about treating their customers right.

"When I was looking for a bluetooth headset, I came to Amazon.com to check out the reviews. This bluetooth seemed to get really good reviews. So, I ordered it. The first one that was sent to me was the wrong model. No problem, accidents happen. The second one arrived and was the correct model. I paired the headset with my Blackberry Curve 8330 and tried it out. I could hear the person on the other end really good. The volume was great! The earpiece is very comfortable and lightweight. Did not bother me at all to wear it. So, me being able to hear the caller was one definite PLUS. But..... that's only half the reason to use a bluetooth. I proceeded to use the ""voice commands"". It could not understand one thing I told it to do. That is not a huge deal for me. So, I dialed my wife and she said she could hear me ""OK"" but not real clear. I spoke louder with the same results. I then took it to work and wore it all day. I am on my phone alot and this is not my first bluetooth. I finally got tired of having to repeat everthing I said and took the bluetooth off figuring I would try it the next day. Well, the next day came and I had the same results! I love the fact that I can hear callers but I cannot accept the fact that they can not hear me. They can always hear ALL of the background noises, but my voice is not clear. On my older Motorola bluetooth this was not a problem but I was hoping to use a smaller model. Guess I will have to drag the older one out and stick with it.

"I don't want much. I don't care about cameras, bluetooth, internet access, etc...I just need a phone. Motorola's V197 seemed like a great answer...It suited my needs well initially...it seemed durable, had more than enough features, and worked well.

I've had little problem with this in any of the phones I've owned for the past ten years. So I'm a little miffed that I can't talk inside on a phone purchased in 2009. To make this worse, I found that the battery life is absolutely terrible. I took my phone for a two day trip and decided not to pack the charger. Two days and a new phone...what could go wrong?

"This is a good shower head but it has a few design flaws. Firstly, it has a quarter inch lip before the threads start. That means using this shower head with a diverter is impossible as only 2 or 3 threads engage before it hits the body. I had to cut the lip off in order to get enough threads onto the diverter. Secondly, the threads are coarser than they should be and it doesnt have a seal at the base of the threads. That means you need to use a lot of plumber tape and put more torque than should be necessary on the threads to have the shower head seal properly and not leak. If you plan to use this head without a diverter then it will work for your, just use a lot of plumber tape on the pipe coming out of the wall. Otherwise, its big and delivers a good volume of water, feels like its well put together.

"I've owned this Plantronics Calisto Pro cordless phone for about 6 months. It's my 3rd cordless phone which I use at the office on a daily basis. Here's a concise summary of the pros and cons based on my experience: Pros: 1. Very comfortably headset; 2. Easy to charge both headset and handset; 3. Great lighted LCD display; 4. Handset stays connected to the base at a good distance; 5. Headset stays connected to the handset for up to approx. 30 feet; 6. Very good sound quality; 7. Easy to adjust the volume while speaking. Cons: 1. Headset disconnects unexpectedly (hanging up on the caller, approximately every 30th call); 2. Small buttons which are tough to read (even though they are lighted); 3. Limited instruction manual; 4. Annoying to hang-up phone (either pressing a small button on the side of the headset or pressing the tough to find button on the handset). I spoke with a technician at Plantronics regarding the headset disconnection problem. He was minimally helpful, instructing me to re-link the headset and base (even though they are only a few feet apart when it disconnects), which only corrected the problem temporarily. Overall, it's a good phone with many pros and some significant cons, at a very significant price. My conclusion is that I would not buy this phone again, but will continue to use it for now.",neutral,neutral,0.04696184584045785,0.8821031165396316,0.07093503761991052

"The phone looks good and has a great design. Here are the negatives. It falls short on features that other cheaper phones has to offer. Navigating the software is slow. I don't understand why a company like Motorola didn't include numbering the selection features so navigating is faster and easier. You always have to scroll for the selection features you want. This is very annoying. The Razor has a big screen, but all the feature selections text is small. Only when you dial a phone number is the text easy to read. The wallpaper is in both the exterior and the interior. You can't have two separate wallpaper. The wallpaper is tinted when you make feature selections in the background making it very hard to view the text. This is the most annoying. Only when you select no wallpaper on both the exterior and the interior can you view the text and the external clock better. The camera phone could be better. My other cheaper phone took better pictures. And when you are talking on the phone and you need to give someone a phone number from your cell phone book, you can't. Here are the positives: The ring tones are loud and not distorted. The speaker phone sounds good. The calendar works great. You can reorder the feature selections. I like the key pad. The alarm clock feature is excellent as you can set more than one with different ring tones. The alarm and calendar also work when you turn off the phone. I discovered this one afternoon at a movie theatre. I tuned off my cell phone out of respect for my fellow movies goers and, RING! RING! RING! The alarm came on right in the middle of the movie.

"I got the Z9 earlier this year. I did a lot of research and it appeared to be the best one out there at any price. The performance has seemed to be good, battery life is good, it's light, small and about as comfortable, even without the ear hook, and aesthetic as you can get for something stuck in your ear. The sound quality on my end has always been good (after the firmware upgrade) and seldom did I ever have to use the higher level of noise cancellation. Updating the firmware was a real pain, but was worth it in terms of performance improvement, and it beats having to buying a new headset every couple of months like most other BT headsets. Now fast forward 4-5 months. The earpiece has a rubber cushion that disintegrates after 3-5 months of occasional use. the thing cust falls out of your ear now. I checked some other review sights and it seems to be a common problem. When I checked BlueAnts web site trying to find replacements, I found that they wanted $10.00 plus shipping each! Every 3-5 months? But no worry, I can save my money because they have been out of stock for months and have no idea when they (BlueAnt) will get more in. The also say that the earpiece is not under the warranty, even though the the warranty does not exclude it. A reputable company would recall a clearly defective unit, or at least offer free or reduced priced replacement parts until a proper fix is worked out. These guys take it as an opportunity for another profit stream. If you really like the electronics, I heard that some of the Jabra eargel configurations may work on the Z9.

"I purchased this headset to go with my Motorola Razr V3. The good: Small size especially when microphone is folded. Very good sound quality transmitting, good sound quality receiving. Fast connection when opening the microphone. The bad: Not adujstable for ear size/shape. Somewhat loose when in position. Details: I checked out the sound quality with several calls including calls to voicemail where I compared messages placed with the headset to those using the handset. The quality was very clear and crisp in the transmit direction with none of the echoing or hollowness others have reported. The receive direction was only marred by occasional low-level pops and clicks, but use otherwise very clear. I also noticed the looseness when the headset was in position, but I found that by changing the position you can make it feel more secure: in my case by not pushing it on too far. The problem is that this headset is not adjustable for ear size and in my case the speaker outlets end up pretty far away from the ear canal such that when I use it in the car the volume is too low to be acceptable, even using the provided rebber skirt. Bottom line: if it fits your ear properly you will probably be pleased.

"With my Palm Pre being the gateway to my audio content, I was growing tired of using a cable to hook it up to my Bluetooth-less vehicle. This was the cheapest solution for my needs (new car or new stereo are both too pricey today), as I wasn't expecting to take many calls...especially after hearing the reviews regarding the mic. Installation was pretty easy. I already had a ground loop isolator and it worked well with the LiquidAUX. One aspect of the installation was getting the remote to work. It seems that my unit needed to have the spring tension increased, so I lifted the spring (it was relatively flat) up a bit. Its been working ever since (a week now). Connection with my Palm Pre (Sprint) was easy, as the generic PIN wasn't needed to be entered. I had to use a splitter to power both my car charger for my Palm Pre (I use a Touchstone, and the USB port doesnt provide enough power for the Touchstone) and it works just as well. Both profiles showed up on my device and on the LiquidAUX. The LiquidAUX displays orange when connected and blue when in use, and there is an icon for music and for voice which helps indicate which profile is being used. The best part of the LiquidAUX thus far has been its consistent connection. It quickly connects to my Palm Pre in about 8 seconds after starting the vehicle (I have it attached to a port that turns off with the vehicle). The remote is great, as it pauses most audio programs running on my Pre (Pandora, what gives?!). The directions say that you can initiate voice commands with the 'Phone' button, but my Palm Pre has yet to implement this feature so I couldn't test it out. Lastly, the incoming voice quality is good enough for me. I mounted the LiquidAUX on the lower portion of the center stack, just above the cup holders and gear shift selector. It points towards me. I mention this to give you an indication of the mic's orientation. My voice is also a projecting one, so it helps my situation. I believe that coupled with the lower mount (decreased road and ambient noise) and my voice, people hear me fine. Again, this solution isn't aimed at voice calls in my opinion, and I would pay an extra $20 for a wireless mic that I can clip on my visor for a more robust voice call experience. All in all, a nice solution (even if temporary) for a somewhat wireless solution for audio streaming.",positive,positive,0.007069957225160791,0.06103114840445385,0.9318988943703854

"I agree with most of what's been written already here and I'd like to add my 2 cents as I have owned the n95-8GB too and I can tell you categorically, the N82 is a much better phone. Despite of the fact that it doesn't have 3G, I've decided to buy it and the reason is that I don't really need the 3G most of the times. Since it has Wi-Fi I can compensate for extensive downloads and applications. Using the EDGE is of course 'painful' compared to 3G and the only downside is that download and voice calls can't go through simultaneously. No biggy. N95 had a lot of bugs and very annoying lags in the camera when shooting (see my n95 review). Worst was a few seconds (literally) from the moment the shutter was pressed to the moment the picture was taken, processed and have the camera ready for the next one. An absolute no go... Slider is so flimsy on the N95 that I was really afraid the screen part is going to crack and dislocate. The N82's camera is a great improvement on that part. It has a Xenon flash and a much faster response time. I personally prefer the lens slide as a camera activator because it prevents accidental camera mode when in the holster, something I have experienced with the N95 quite a lot. Very useful function (especially for travelers): The modem function works great either via the USB modem driver or the Bluetooth, with download speeds that could put some so-called `broadband' speeds to shame. This is great in places where you have no Wi-Fi or free Wi-Fi for your laptop (like in Airport terminals, etc). The phone also syncs with the PC (outlook) using the same connections (through the USB or via Bluetooth) MicroSD: The N82's spec doesn't state support for HC MicroSD memory, but I took the chance and bought an 8GB one and it works flawlessly... Screen: Auto rotation is somewhat annoying but it can be disabled. Media player: Sometimes it freezes with other applications running to the point when it freezes and restarts the phone. It happens rarely but it does (with the latest FW version). Sound quality is reasonable although on my phone I hear clicks and pops on the over tones which is weird because I only transferred the songs as MP3 without additional compression to MP4 which is available through the Media Manager. A-GPS: Well this is a debatable function and whether useful or not it is up to how much really one needs a GPS. I find it to be a nice toy to have but I don't consider it as a serious GPS. In fact the Nokia maps are not so great for this service. The Voice guidance is free for only 3-days after which the navigation is disabled and when used, it redirects to purchase options which are so ridiculously expensive. I downloaded Google maps for the phone which work much better overall. Battery life: Much better than the N95, though it is not even close to what's in the spec. I don't know why Nokia doesn't think about that. The battery should be at least 1300mAh to give a decent battery life between charges. Overall it's a good phone for the price I paid (I don't see why one would pay more than a $150) for the black one as priced on Amazon, or even more for the N95 which doesn't give you more for the money.",positive,positive,0.008534687400286912,0.2397674273790476,0.7516978852206655

"Seriously one of the best purchases I'VE. EVER. MADE. My phone used to die at the end of the day. That was fine if it was a weekday or if I was going straight home. BUT if we went to a restaurant after work and then out to a club or something to celebrate the weekend, my phone would go kaput. Then, I was there, inebriated without access to Uber or any of my friends numbers. Best case scenario: I had to call in favors to be dropped off at my house. Worst case scenario: I once had to walk home through East Atlanta. At 3am on a Saturday night. And legitimately had to sprint to my apartment complex when a car on the street pulled a U-Turn and drove after me. I knew they weren't going to ask me directions. I was either going to get robbed, or worse. I bought this PowerBear extended battery and haven't had my phone die in less than 3 days.

"I would definitely say that this phone is one of the best looking phone out there. But the Cingular Motorola RAZR black that i got a couple of months ago.

Pretty bad. i had to go 4 times replacement in 2 weeks and it still buzzing on lcd and keypad. well i got no choice but buy a different phone. i'm not sure if this a software issue or just the phone itself. anyone have the same problem??

"Because of low reviews across the board for 2.5mm to 3.5mm adapters, I ordered two adapters ""just in case"". I'm glad I did because the first adapter worked with my Bose Noise Reduction headphones, but the second only provided sound through one ear of the headphones. Alternatively, I tried both adapters using my Blackberry to play BB mp3s into the aux input of my 2008 Ford Escape. Both adapters only provided audio to the left speakers. I tried several 3.5mm to 3.5mm male to male cables to see if it was the cable, but all cables had the same results. I also tried to wiggle the adapters and cables to find an intermittent connection, but this did not yield any new information. The problem with the adapter is one of the following: 1) My blackberry (it works fine with Bose headphones so I don't think it is my BB). 2) My Ford Escape audio input (this works great with my ipod so it should be okay). 3) The 2.5mm to 3.5mm adapters (likely). 4) The manufacturing tolerances of the 2.5mm adapter may not be good enough for consistent performance across several devices.

"Based on the positive reviews here and elsewhere, especially compared to the Jawbone, I went for this headset as my first foray into Bluetooth. I'll be returning it for one simple reason: The microphone volume is too low and you can't adjust it. Most of my calls are conference calls. If people can't hear me, which they can't with this headset nearly as well as with my wired headset or the phone handset, then it's useless. The sound quality of the speaker itself is great, but that offers little consolation. I spoke to Plantronics support and they recommended the Discovery 925, their new model with ""Audio IQ"", which increases your voice volume, but they said that it doesn't do as well with wind.

"My first GPS as I've been waiting for the prices to come down. The Nuvi 200 doesn't have all the features of higher priced models(MP3 player, bluetooth, etc.) but it does its job of navigation just as well as the higher priced models in the Garmin line. At first I thought I really needed to have the text to voice option(the actual street name spoken vs. just turn left)which this model does not have. In reality it's not a big deal as the top of the screen shows you the name of the upcoming turn in large letters...so just a glance to the screen can quickly confirm the street/route name if indeed you really need to see it. Size of unit is perfect, easily slips into pocket, yet no problem with entering destination on touch screen. Volume is loud enough to play radio with decent volume and still hear the Garmin's cues. Screen brightness is very good and battery life(should you decide to not use the supplied plug into your lighter outlet) is very good. I charge the unit with a USB cable from my computer as there is no supplied AC power adapter on this model. Unit charges up quickly with USB cable. Of course you can just plug it into your car's lighter power outlet and your good to go. Only disappointment so far has been that some addresses do not show up on the updated maps(latest 2008 version shipped with my Nuvi)...such as Retirement community in a small town that's been there for almost 5 years, therefore the reason for 4 stars vs. 5 star rating.",positive,neutral,0.013553019788903213,0.5925699445146813,0.3938770356964155

"updated 6/5/08 I have had this phone for more than a year, now. The good ----- +The keyboard is pretty good - it could have more height on the key domes but it works okay. Probably one of the best of the qwerty - or any phone keyboards. +The Screen is nice - 2.8 inch diagonal +The Device is small- smaller than the MDA which is almost the same +The coating looks and feels good +Some helpful programs +My faves might save you some money +Battery life is decent +T-Mobile customer service is about as good as phone companies get. Usually tied with Verizon for the best (JD Power) or just barely behind Verizon (Checkbookdotorg). +T-Mobile rates are cheaper than Verizon and ATT, and usually are as good if not better than Sprint. The not so good ----------------- -Edge - it is okay but T-Mobile does not have 3G or faster connection yet. Sprint, Cingular/ATT and Verizon all have comparable or better devices with 3G / Ev-Do speeds. (May 2008 3G on T-Mobile NYC and soon to spread) -Memory - usable memory gets low pretty fast. You need to close programs before you open other programs usually and remember to restart it every other day. Also there is some lag time when turning on programs or waiting for the screen to change to horizontal when you open the keyboard. (UPDATE - go to howardforums to find free programs to speed up your Wing and a procedure to fix some of the memory issue. These fixes make it a four star phone I think). -Phone buttons get pushed easily in the provided holster (even with lock screen enabled - the green and red phone buttons are still active and they stick out and so you will answer calls without meaning to, or hangup occasionally). -Processor is a slow 201mhz by todays standards. While this makes for good battery life, it is disappointing to see Cingular with the 400mhz Hermes/8525 and Sprint with the 6700 and set to release the upgrade to the Hermes - the 6800 in October. (Verizon has the XV6800 now as well). All are faster machines with faster connections. And, of course, there is the iPhone with a 600+mhz processor. -T-Mobile help just told me that the darn phone will not always sync recurring appointments correctly. This is of course not a T-Mo or an HTC problem but a WM6 problem. Apparently if you put a time limit on the recurring appointments it solves the problem. Say - this recurring appointment will end after 999 ocurrences. ============= Bottom line (so far for me): if you have a Dash or MDA (ATT 8125) or something comparable that is still working - save your money and wait for the next ppc. Certainly the various 6800s are better than this. If you want a qwerty ppc with touch screen - you might be pleased. It may be the best T-Mobile could do given their limited technology (no 3G in my city yet) and customer preferences (small phones are more popular).",neutral,neutral,0.050462838056561,0.7221209388307299,0.22741622311270904

"I ordered this phone a month back and just received it a few days ago. I bought it mainly for the 3G connection and the fact that it's an Nseries phone. I came from a Nokia 6230 which is a fairly small candy bar style phone so going to a bigger flip phone like the N75 is a big step. I did use a 6102i or whichever free phone cingy had at the time and my gripes are basically compared to those two phones. HATE: - Sim card access. I don't know if there's another way to do this but once you insert that SIM card, you have to have a child take it out. Almost impossible for me to grab and pull out. - Speakerphone is really low and almost inaudible even with the volume cranked up - Vibrate on the phone is really... mild. If it's in your pocket, you probably won't feel it. Especially if you're on the train, for example. - Long boot up compared to the two non Symbian phones I had. - very annoying pop port .. i didn't think it would be an issue but if you have to hold the phone with two hands to insert your headset... annoying. - no emoticons on txt messages??!! - to reply to a txt you have to hit options->reply->via txt msg. Why can't i just hit reply and go straight to the txt box? - zoom on phone takes f o r e v e r. - where is the STOPWATCH and COUNTDOWN TIMER?! - fingerprints/face prints get xfrd to phone easily - my battery life : internet use only on/off = 4-6 hours with 2 10min calls and 6hours standby; MobiRadio on speaker, continuous = 1.5hours; mixed internet, mobiradio, regular radio, phone calls, text messaging, tinkering with phone= 6 hours or so. All hours est from full charge to when the batt just dies. Includes intermittent standbys and where I just look through the phone. The charger is now tethered to my hip. Like: - really soft and big keys - ability to move around the files/ folders - Nice big screen - Video (choppy and pixelated but it will do) will con't as the months pass..... ** UPDATE: -battery life has improved significantly. I still use it 13hrs a day but I now charge just once a day. And i use it more. -I also bought this primarily as an MP3 player and I'm having the same problem that I had with the 6230. The shuffle is not really a shuffle. I have about 200 songs in there and it insists on playing the same songs over and over every 10th-15th song... it seems to loop to songs I've heard already every single time. -I use the HS-31 headset that I had before and the volume is just really low. I have to roll the windows up in my car in order to carry a conversation. I thought it was just the speakerphone that had a low volume. The bluetooth earpiece was loud, though. -And finally, 3G. I found no discernable difference between EDGE and the 3G networks while downloading video or viewing webpages. Maybe it loaded up a page a few seconds faster but that was about it. Mobiradio still buffered every now and then in 3G networks so that was surprising as well. I'm still going to keep the phone, though.",neutral,neutral,0.08280448772046511,0.8179508100293894,0.09924470225014552

Bought this item because it is suppose to be an official Samsung OEM product. Samsung Galaxy phones require at least a 1.0A charger else it discharges. This product works as sold but is made very cheaply and the cord is very short. I do not expect it to last very long. I have already migrated to another type vehicular charger which has dual USB receptacles and is rated at 2.0A. More times than not I need to charge two phones in the car at once. The added benefit of USB is that it allows me to standardize and use the cable in the car or house.,neutral,negative,0.36525494745046466,0.36061192298481964,0.27413312956471575

I put a case on it so I don't have to look at it all the time, otherwise it would really bother me. I wanted a different color phone, but not have a phone with different colors.

"VoSKY Call Center looks good on paper, but the software is extremely bad and the product is almost unsupported by Actiontec. Software bugs make it so that I can use skype when this product is installed less than 5% of the time, so installing this makes skype essentially useless. Bugs I have encountered include randomly crashing Skype, automatically changing Skype sound card settings to incorrect values (ensuring it cannot work), hanging up Skype calls with a phone line disconnected message, even though there is no line disconnect (and even though the phone line is not being used so it should not matter), incompatibility with basic Windows features like fast user switching, incompatibility with non-administrator Windows users, requirement that you be logged into Windows to use, and so much more. I strongly recommend against purchasing this product, and from this experience I personally plan to avoid all Actiontec products.

"At first I was real excited about this product. Over time, it seems to have a hard time detecting my Blackberry. I would have hoped that every time I got in the car, it would link up to the phone and when I left the car it would disconnect after being a certain distance away. Maybe I am expecting too much. The other thing that bothers me is the the column seems to change even during a phone call. The output volume seems to drop as much as 50%.

"For me the sound quality is by far the most important factor when I compare headsets. Everything else is secondary. I drive a very noisy construction van so background noise is a serious problem. I have compared 8 different headsets and the Plantronics Voyager 510 is the only one that allows a clear conversation in this environment. I have used it daily for over 2 years and often for 6+ hours straight until the battery is dead. In a loud, dirty, construction environment, often lying on the ground, it's the only thing I've found that works. With the other models, either I, the caller, or both of us couldn't understand a word being said. For those of you that don't have background noise issues, I can add that even in quiet settings this unit has better sound quality than all the others that I tested. The way that I do my tests is to pair 2 headsets, put one in each ear and then switch between them while on the same call. This way I and the caller can compare the sound quality at almost the exact same time. The 2 cons I can mention are that the on/off button is too small and hard to push, and that when the battery is almost dead the buttons stop working (even though the sound continues fine) so you have to hang up using the phone instead of the headset. To be fair though, the ""almost dead battery"" symptoms happen in many of the other ones I've tested also. I don't care, sound is everything.",positive,neutral,0.09593699207798369,0.6591643771865185,0.24489863073549772

At the begining, it is a really tight fit and the clasp doesn't want to shut easily but that is getting better as I use it.

It has an opening in the bottom like for an iPhone and the speakers are on the back and the power plug is on the side above where the opening is there.

"I used this while traveling in Europe and would have been lost without it as I used it to charge up my smartphone w/ GPS. I managed to completely charge my phone 3 times over a two day period when I was staying in a hostile with no way to securely charge my smartphone. This product has one significant downside that my Samsung Galaxy S might be partially responsible for. The micro-usb adapter frequently disconnected from my phone. I tried keeping it in my side pocket, in my backpack, in my backpack's water bottle pouch and in a cellphone specific pocket in my cargo pants. The only I was able to get it to stay consistently connected was by wedging the phone between this charged and my kindle, with my kindle on the outside of my pocket so that there was very little chance of any non-flat surface from touching the adapter. If the charge cable had been less bulky or had a tighter fit in my phone charge port I doubt this would have been an issue. Another issue I have is that the frustrating micro-sd adapter has broken after about 40 charging sessions.

"The main problem I have with this mount is that it is too limited on movement with the ball and socket design. Each joint has a maximum of 22.5 degrees of angle. Since my windshield has an inside angle of 40 degrees (dash to windshield) I had to install the extension joint and move it higher on the windshield to clear the dashboard. But then it is too high and in my driving view. Also with the extension it sticks out too far which also made it less stable causing it to vibrate while driving. One other complaint I have is that the joints are large and bulky making it an unsightly mount. The one positive is that the suction cup design seemed to work well, screwing the base pulls the center of the suction cup inward.

"I was very enthusiastic about this headset based on friends' recommendations and some reviews, but it was a huge disappointment. Apparently I got one with the defect where it kept slipping out of the charging tube. (That's one truly bizarre design.) It could not be charged. I contacted Plantronics and they agreed to ship a replacement (very good customer service, by the way). The second one fit better in the charger, but still fails to make contact 1 out of 5 or 6 times. Even when charged, the headset is hard to use. When in my ear, the join between the earpiece and main body is floppy and the headset flops down to an unusable angle. The controls and flashing-light sequences are hard to understand and follow. And to top things off, the Bluetooth performance with my Treo 700p is unacceptable (I can't even put it in the pocket of my jogging shorts without static, for example). At this point I've given up on it and am looking for a replacement.",negative,negative,0.6499397296664916,0.32767921280872087,0.022381057524787657
"I've had this little gem for a few weeks now, and so far I have to say that it's the best headset I've used yet, and like many, I've gone through a few. Incidently, I'm using with an HTC 8125 smart phone, and it connected with no trouble whatsoever. PROS: * extremely light * good volume, even when driving (windows up, noisy car) * easy to use * good reference guide * easily usable for right or left ear (I use the left ear) * I'm guessing, but should work well with any Bluetooth capable phone * affordable * can be a good distance from the phone and still converse (15-20 feet before the static kicks in) * long standby battery life (I sometimes go 3-4 days without charging, that includes mild talking as well) CONS: * once in a while there's a little static even when close to the phone, but it's white noise for me at this point * at first, I found it odd to get it on my ear, as it sits _ON_ the ear, not _IN_ the ear ... after a couple different approaches, easy breezy Overall, two thumbs up ... I like it so much, I've talked a couple people into getting it and they love it! If you want a great wireless headset for your cell, buy this one ...

"Was extremely dissappointed in the Jawbone. In short it's very poorly designed and doesn't provide the performance as advertised. It doesn't fall a little short...it's not even close to the mark of bluetooth headsets that I used several years ago. I'm a average sized man with average ears, facial structure etc. and could never get the Jawbone Headset to rest comfortably in my ear or have the earhook not create an unpleasant, uncomfortable feeling. I was always sure to have the contact point touching my face to be sure the noise cancelling worked correctly but people always told me I sounded like I was on a speaker phone and at times had real difficulty hearing me. I use this in business everyday and it conveyed a very unprofessional ""appearance"". I tried everything I could to get better performance but nothing worked. I used this for several months giving it every opportuniy to perform. The fit to the ear is a serious problem for a lot of people and a major disadvantage to this headset not to mention the poor sound quality. I replace it with the Plantronics Discovery 925 Bluetooth Earpiece(better price and the latest ""clear"" technology), which comes in BLACK, SILVER, GOLD, and PURPLE. The fit to the ear is extremely comfortable and secure, the receiving sound excellent and to the person I'm talking to they say it sounds like I'm on a land line. Never anymore complaints from peole I'm speaking to. From another reviewer's recommendation, I also purchased a windscreen that you can use to cover the end of the headset that's exposed to block any interference with wind noise. So if you know you're going to be outside at a ball game, riding a bicycle, etc., you can slip this on and have a headset that blocks virtually any wind noise making this the perfect unit. I bought two of the windscreens and keep one in my car and the other in my latop computer case so they are ready to use when needed. You can order directly from Etymotic Research, item # ER89-30 only $1.75 per set. [...] The Plantronics Discovery 925 Bluetooth Earpiece also comes with a charging case that not only safely stores your headset, but serves to recharge it if you were to run the headset battery down...very cool bonus feature for long trips...and long conversations when you can't charge your headset with the hard wire! Check out the reviews on the Plantronics Discovery 925 Bluetooth Earpiece and buy instead...you'll be glad you did.

"I purchased this phone just over a year ago and I have to say that it has served me well. Verizon's network is extremely reliable. I can't remember the number of times I've had service when friends of mine with other providers did not and they had to use my phone to make calls. The pics aren't great quality, but that's what I own a camera for. To take spur of the moment pics to send friends, its fine. As far as the bluetooth issue goes, it hasn't bothered me any because I don't have a need for it, but its something to consider. The one complaint I do have, and I'm beginning to think this is a general motorola problem (especially after reading some of the other reviews), is the battery. This is the second motorola I've purchased that after about 8 months to a year, the battery loses charge after only a few hours even if the phone isn't in use. I'm not sure if the problem lies in the battery or in the connection for the charger because I do notice sometimes my phone is plugged in and not actually charging. I still prefer motorolas over other brands available because of the style and text messaging options, but I would highly recommend purchasing the insurance for 5 bucks a month just in case.

"I purchased this product because of its convenience and price ($50). The convenience of having a truly hands-free communication device is wonderful until it breaks. It is even less convenient when it breaks 3 times. After 2 months of using the product, the plastic hinges cracked. Then a piece of the plastic hinge broke off, now exposing any internal parts to dirt, rain, etc,. which happened to mine. The first time it quit was on a rainy day when (this is my guess as to what happened) a drop of rain affected the microphone in which I could hear others, but they could not hear me. I called Motorola for a Return Authorization, spent $5 to send it FedEx Ground to the company and in 2-3 weeks I received a new one. After not having this convenience product for a few weeks, I used it and a crack appeared on the microphone portion within 3-4 weeks. The rubber portion around the earpiece began to detach itself. The product was still working so I kept using it. Then the hinges went as it did before. Although it was working, I called Motorola to find out why they've made such a poor quality product for which the retail value is around $100? Their response included a Return Authorization, so for another $5 I sent it in again and was inconvenienced for another 2-3 weeks. It's been about two months since I've had my 3rd earpiece and the hinges cracked and now exposed its insides. Today the microphone earpiece began cracking. But it still works! Not well, but it works! So please read others reviews about earpieces and its durability before purchasing as the HS810 is a wonderful product if it were to last longer than at least 6 months.",negative,negative,0.883412522297852,0.1150800986309622,0.0015073790711857473

"I bought this headset to use with my iPhone. If you have an iPhone, read the last part of this review. Overall its an okay headset. Hooked up to my computer and I can now listen to the computer wirelessly. It is a little confusing getting it into pair mode. There are two ""M"" (Motorola Logos) buttons, one on the left and one on the right. It can be confusing remembering which one you should hit. It does not do much to reduce background noise. I am happy enough with it for the devices that it works with. If you have an iPhone, this is not the product for you. Really, this is designed to listen to music through. If you want to just take calls a smaller ear piece is better. The iPhone(as of 1.1) WILL NOT play music through this well. There is a hack that will allow you to play music through it. If you go to voice mail and turn on the headphones, and return to the iPhone, then it will play MONO music through the iPhone. However, the iPhone will still play through its built in speaker. If you plug ear buds in, then it cuts off the wireless headsets. I do not fault the headset for the iPhone issues. The iPhone is just NOT currently setup(as of 1.1) to play music through headsets. I hope this changes in the future.",neutral,neutral,0.4782183988907236,0.49625541184937805,0.0255261892598983

"This is a well made case. It is stylish enough to be worn with business attire - and that is what it would look best with. The outside of the case is black and the inside is a tan leather. There is a small ""C"" logo on the outside flap...and it is not too big (about 1cmx1cm). The flap closes securely with the aid of a magnet. The clip seems relatively sturdy as I've been using it for the past week or so. If you would rather not attach the clip and use the permanent belt loop you can do that too. The reason this has 4 stars and not 5 is that it fits the DROID X a little oddly. It is actually somewhat difficult to insert and remove it from the case if you put the camera end down. I find it to be almost a two handed operation. That being said, it holds it very securely and will not fall out even if the flap was not closed. With the camera end down, the flap closes completely and easily. Also, with the camera end down you can access the top button on the phone as well part of the side volume toggle (probably enough to be able to press and silence the phone without taking it out of the case). If you insert the phone with the camera side up, it is easy to remove one handed but it does not hold the phone as securely. With the camera side up the flap doesn't close as easily. It still closes, but you have to push it into place a bit more to make it securely latched. Lastly, in this orientation the side buttons are very accessible but not the top one (unless you open the flap). In the camera down position the charging port will be available while in the case, camera up position it will not be. I do not have any cases on my Droid X - if you have any case whatsoever I seriously doubt this will fit. Overall I would recommend if you don't have a case on your droid X and are looking for a well made, stylish, and secure case for your phone. With a silicone case or anything that increases the outside dimensions of the phone this will likely not work well. I am considering trying to ""stretch"" it out a little to see if that helps.

"I ordered this a few weeks ago and was really excited about receiving it. Coincidentally the day before my N95-4 arrived, Nokia released a new firmware update so the first thing I did was update the software on my N95-4 to the latest version. During the update process I noticed the USB port on the phone itself seemed loose but thought nothing of it. After the update was done I began to use the phone and I ended up returning it to Amazon the next day! You've seen all the positive reviews, so I won't rehash that, but here are why I returned it: - The USB port on my N95-4 was extremely loose or broken. You had to apply a lot of pressure and push the cable in and then not touch it for it to stay connected. It was so loose that a breeze from the window could disconnect the device from the PC. I tried several USB cables, computers/ports with no success. - The USB transfer speed is HORRIFIC for a device that comes with 8GB. It took almost 2.5 hours to transfer about 4GB of music to the device using Windows Media Player. Using mass storage mode is just as slow since this uses USB 2.0 Full-Speed (old spec) not USB 2.0 High-Speed (common today). No matter what people tell you this is absolutely frustrating and annoying over time, even if you don't transfer stuff much. - The slider on the phone is wobbly and whenever I pressed a button on the keypad it made a creaking sound that I don't expect from a $600 phone. It did not feel solid at all, at least not my N95-4 - The overall size of the device is surprisingly small but the thing is as thick as a brick which makes it awkward to carry in your pant pocket or worse jeans pocket. - Even without really installing any apps on it the thing would randomly slow down and not respond to key presses and then just ""wake up"" all of a sudden it was bizarre. - Does not charge via USB. Not used to this so was annoying that you have to at times have both a USB cable and Nokia charger plugged in. I ended up getting a Nokia N78 (US 3G) that was just recently released and I'm extremely happy with it. It addresses most if not all of the issues I had with the N95-4 including fastest USB, fast CPU/responsive, excellent build quality. I would recommend looking at the N78 or the upcoming N96 (successor to N95) over the N95-4.",neutral,neutral,0.14649402701769845,0.829439008381005,0.024066964601296648

"My last Bluetooth headset, a Cardo Scala 500 featured great sound, wonderful battery life but a poor, floppy fit and very crummy construction. The poor thing literally fell apart after three months. I replaced the Cardo today with a Plantronics Explorer 320 and I'm pretty satisfied. First, recognize that there is no such thing as a perfect all-around headset for all phones and all users. It's pretty important that you buy from a source, like Amazon, where you can try things and return them if not satisfied. EBay may have great prices on stuff, but unless you know you'll like something, I wouldn't suggest buying a BT Headset there... way too hard to return. The Plantronics 320 is a budget version of their upper end headsets, but it is hard to see where they scrimped. The fit and finish of the product is excellent. The power connector is solid and snapped in and charged the unit quickly. It paired up to my Treo 650 on the first try and was identified correctly by name. Using the 320, I made several calls to automated numbers. All connected quickly, except the one where my phone automatically follows a script to punch in passwords. In that call, there was a considerable delay before the 320 took the audio signal from my phone. My old Cardo had the same delay, so I think this is a function of the phone. The fit of the headset is great for me. The unit has a small portion that inserts gently in my ear, and the wrap-around portion holds the device closely to my ear without any pressure or discomfort. I've been wearing it all day and it is light and very comfortable. Your mileage may vary. So what's not perfect? The sound quality isn't quite there. I pick up some static between the device and my Treo and it gets worse when the phone is on the other side of my body or when I move more than five feet away. It's not horrible, but it's there in my setup. Again, your mileage may vary.",positive,neutral,0.35589479715809186,0.4777265474526,0.16637865538930802

"The good: 1. Slowly charges an HTC (Nexus) phone. The bad: 2. Contrary to the description, this charger does not charge the Samsung Galaxy S2 phone at all.

"This is a good case. When I initially put it on, it fit on my 3rd gen Ipod perfectly. It also looks really sharp and the plastic over the screen is a nice touch to give the screen the protection it needs. It'll do its job very well. All ports are accessible and it is easy to plug into my computer or into my car jack so I can listen to my music in my car. The only thing it will not fit is my IHome. This is minor to me as it is not used frequently, but I thought I would add my two cents, seeing as there were already reviews about it working on other ports...other ports, but not my IHome. Here are the problems: First, I am an intelligent man and know how to work most electronics I've come across. When I received this case, however, the clip that goes along with was not built onto the case and so I had quite a hard time figuring out how it was supposed to fit. Second, I would had liked the clip to had looked like the rest of the case...the white clip looks a little tacky connected to an otherwise clear and sharp looking case. Third, the clip itself spins and doesn't stay put. In real life I don't believe this will be much of a problem as I have a case I put my Ipod in and so will not use the clip as much, but still I question why it spins. Finally, the thing that bothers me the MOST about the product is how difficult its removal from my Ipod is. Maybe I'm unaware of a special ""trick"" to open it, nut I was unable to open this case using just my fingers. I literally had to take a butter knife and carefully pry the case open so as not to damage the case and especially not my Ipod. I like how it protects my Ipod, but I wish there was easier ways to open the case other than the method I described as it is especially tedious, annoying, and could hurt my Ipod. Regardless, a good product and I'm keeping it.",neutral,neutral,0.04850027915244843,0.5398863122199608,0.41161340862759094
"The i850 has a great sounding speaker. It doesn't distort as other Nextel radios do. The display is good. The nice blue glow of the external display is nice, also. But the ""media center"" is painfully frustrating, and lack any good features that are common in other phones. There is no slide show feature, no flash for the camera. I can't figure out how to change the default picture size, so I have to adjust it before every picture. There's no video capability. The menu button and power buttons are annoyingly small. It is very frustrating every time I need to charge the battery because the connector on the phone has a cover that keeps getting in the way. I understand the need for the cover, but they should have used one that flips up and down instead of a rubber stopper. The battery life on this phone is terrible and makes the phone almost un-usable. I can't make it through an 8 hour workday with moderate usage. This phone is sturdily constructed and fairly well designed, but the user interface needs a lot more thought. My Sanyo MM-7400 phone that I had before this was much more easy to use and had more features, but I needed a Nextel for work. This phone is overall a nice looking and good working phone, but the many little annoyances make me wish I could use the Sanyo phone on the Nextel network.",neutral,neutral,0.022962106148659386,0.6758594261648725,0.30117846768646817

"I had a negative shipping experience with this seller. Although they were ultimately apologetic, they were not proactive with a way to resolve their shipping issue.

I am very concerned that there is no sense of urgency even once my complaint was made. The seller did want to have me promptly remove my comments about the poor service.

"The item pictured on Amazon is not what you receive. What you get is a poorly constructed and ill fitting cable. The first issue I had was that the plastic was already cracked at one of the ends, making the red and black insides of the cable visible. Secondly, the end you would plug your headphones in is much too tight. You have to apply some serious pressure if you wanted to fit them in there. Lastly, the end that you would plug into your phone broke off within five minutes of opening the package.

"This battery does not disappoint. I have very few complaints as well about this battery. I liked the versatility with a flashlight, laser pointer, and an external battery. I would have liked an easier way to access what you want. While it says in the manual how to access each of the lights or the battery, it does not work perfectly. The laser pointer works the best because its just a touch of the button. The LED light is the worst because you have to turn on the battery itself before you turn on the light. It just makes for a difficult and confusing experience. Maybe providing two buttons (one for the battery on/off, the other for the lights). This would just make for a better experience with the battery/light. The idea is great and I love it because it hits a large market for people who present with a laser pointer and travel. I also really like the design is great. To make it better (and anything better) I would try to make it thinner. I really like the way it fits in hand. FInally, the LED lights are spot on and work like they should. But one problem I just ran into is that I had 2 LED light is like your last 20% percent. When my battery hit 1 LED, the charger shut off. While I charged my iPhone 2 times from 30% and another iPhone from 27%-57%, I still would have liked to have more knowledge of how much battery I have left. With that being said, the battery still works perfectly and I love it. The fact that it comes with a pouch and other cords is great for the owner of the battery. Pros - battery life and how fast it charges - accessories (pouch and cords) - design - versatility Cons - misleading battery life - confusing button to turn things on After talking to a representative over email, he sent me this: The instruction on the manual definitely needs to be revised because the actual number of seconds in holding the power button for activating each mode is quite crucial. Here are the actual instruction(tested): Laser pointer on/off: one press of the power button Battery on/off: 3 second hold of the power button(letting go of power button at 3 second will turn off battery) LED flashlight: 5 second hold of the power button(in the process of turning on flashlight it does seems to turn on battery as well though) Also, from manual the blue LED indicator should be displayed as follow: 1st LED: ""in use"" when plugged into your desire device & detects a charge 2nd - 4th LED: ""low, med, & high"" power capacity Hopefully this will clear up any confusion with the product for your future reference.

"I had bought a new Razr last fall, and it had a speakerphone function, but didn't come with a corded hands-free headset, which I had been used to using on my previous Nokia phones. I decided to jump in on the bluetooth wagon and this model had gotten good reviews, and was (and still is) on a great sale here on amazon. I bought this in May. I've used it off and on, but keep finding myself going back to just using the speakerphone to be hands free. The fit is just not good for my ear. I'd say you should ""try it on"" before buying, but of course you can't. If you know someone who has one, maybe ask to borrow it. As other reviewers have mentioned, it just isn't a tight fit - it's not uncomfortable that way, but I would find that turning my head sharply to talk to my kids in the back seat would send it flying. It was super easy to connect to the Razr phone, but some people would mention that they had a hard time hearing me when I used it. I could always hear the other person. As it happens, my mother thought she had found this model of mine - I had to travel to her house within the last few weeks and hadn't seen it since - however, when I got it in the mail, it turns out to be an H700 model instead. We've asked all over, but can't find the owner, so I'm using it for now. It fits my ear much better and has the same or better sound quality and features (I think maybe it's just not the newest connection speed, but neither are most phones.)

"I bought this in hopes of saving money by not buying the ""official"" PS3 Headset, and I'm very happy. This headset will work very well with the Playstation 3. I can't directly compare it to the official one, but it's very good. Notes: I do NOT use this with a cell phone. I do NOT really move around much with this in my ear. I do wear it for consecutive hours on end. I sit about 8 feet from my Playstation 3 and the sound quality is very good. Because I don't move much, I don't use the little ear hook, I just stick this directly in my ear and I can run to the bathroom between rounds and it's yet to fall into the toilet. It's not actually fallen out of my ear at any point. However, my ear does get a little uncomfortable after having this in it for a couple of hours, but I'm not sure that any other ear piece would be better. Setting it up / pairing was very easy.

"Bought the White UniColor version of this and about 2 weeks with this case, the outer white section started getting dirty. Might try throwing the case in the dish washer this weekend to see if that cleans it, probably won't though. Other than the discoloration, the case is perfect. It shows off the back just like I want with a bit of ""haze"" to it, which I like (I have the silver HTC One). Buttons line up perfectly fine for me and cutouts are placed very well. I also don't have a SUPCASE logo on the back of mine covering the beataudio logo so I guess I got lucky on that. Other than the discoloration the case is great! Would buy again in a different color probably. UPDATE (9/14/2013): Here is an update to my review after using the WHITE UniColor Case. Unfortunately there is NO WAY to clean the dirt off this once it gets on the white rubber edge which is very disappointing as it looks wonderful, when new, with the phone. Another issue I have now is that the opaque back has separated from the white rubber surround in the bottom left corner of the case. All in all I can no longer recommend the White UniColor Case at this time until they fix the two problems (Discoloration/plastic separation). They recently just dropped the price of these to one dollar, so on that note I will try the Black UniColor in hopes of having a better experience with this one.

"Revision of my initial review. The vendor ""idealpoint"" is actually part of Trent. They provide excellent customer service. +1.510.651.2885 I spoke with Vivien. She resolved all my issues quickly and with a smile. :) The Trent charger itself works perfectly. When you receive it, make sure you fully charge the unit before use. It may show fully charged but charge it anyway. This is my second Trent charger. The IMP500 is about the size and weight of my wallet - this size is perfect for me. I have never drained the old Trent charger while charging my iPhone. It fits easily into a jacket pocket so you can charge and talk while moving around. You can recharge the battery off a wall charger or USB plug. The larger (in capacity, size, and weight) IMP1000 is worth considering for the iPad, but unnecessary for the iPhone, IMO. Caveats: As the ""Technical Details"" state, the current Trent packaging does NOT include an adapter for the iPhone. (This is due to Apple licensing restrictions.) You must use your own cable or find an adapter that will plug into the Trent supplied retractable cable. Two adapters, a micro and mini USB, are supplied. [Hint: If you are nice, Vivien may be able to give (not sell) you an original iPhone adapter that fits on the retractable cable.] I was hoping otherwise, but idealpoint tells me that this Trent charger will only charge 5V devices, not 15-24V computers, etc. so don't try. :( The IMP500 packaging is a little confusing because it hasn't been updated. The back of the box bar-code says the version shipped (x00016bjtp) is only for the (curve, bold, tour, storm). The side of the box says it is for iPads, iPhones, and iPods.

"I *love* my LG phones. My LG ENV 9900 is a tank and a half. We used to open bottles together back in college. I remember when I got it that I would say ""it isn't trying to be thin. This has a 5 day battery life and feels solid"". But, as the 18 months went on, my phone gradually diminished into a 1-day battery life. I also found it randomly turned off in my pocket. For awhile I thought it may have been the battery simply dying quickly, but I realized that it would really crash about 1 in 5 times i sent a text message. And then sometimes when I was in the middle of a cell phone call. I took a chance, and got this new battery. This breathed fresh life into my env! I now get 5 days battery life again, meaning I can go an entire week with light usage and only charge it on the weekends or once overnight when I remember to. It also *rarely* crashes now. ** By replacing my battery, I feel like I have a brand new phone. The seller was fast, the battery is awesome. It *is* silver, and my phone is orange, but I don't mind. Also this battery is a slightly bit larger than the stock battery, I believe. It is actually pretty awesome because as I look at my phone, I realize that the dimensions extend the battery physically in such a way that the back of the phone is flush with the camera, so there is no wobble when it sits screen-up. I think the oem battery, at least in my version, was flush to the base of the phone, not the camera lense, so there was wobble. Although I might be wrong. Thats the end of my review. For a personal backstory, read on. My wife's current alias 2 just started behaving the same way (crashing frequently when texting and when flipping the phone. It makes me wonder how many people throw out perfectly good phones just because they start crashing. I wonder how many of those phones could be fixed by replacing the battery? Her phone might actually be going bad, but many people that I've come across in forums report the same thing for the alias 2 (crashing frequently when flipping and texting) but I haven't found a verified claim of anyone trying a battery replacement (because the battery indicator is always full). With generic batteries being only $5 on the internet, the bet is worth it to me over buying a new phone and contract renewal (or pay up front for a $400 phone...). My thought is that as the battery wears down, as batteries inevitably do by their very nature, there becomes a point where the battery just isn't performing top notch to what the specifications of the system require. Depending on the quality of the components and the tolerance of the operating system, including error detection and error correcting, eventually there will become a point in time where some electronic component can't respond or charge up quick enough because of a drooping voltage, and the operating system crashes. The phone rarely crashes when it is just sitting still in idle. Usually it crashes when trying to flip on the backlight of an LED, for example. This is assuming, of course, that the regular components in the phone don't fail first. In my case, my electrical components are 3 years old but hanging in there, while my battery (which is, honestly, designed to fail before the phone is considered worthless anyways, or about 2 years with current cell phone provider plans) crapped out within specification. By replacing the battery, you're replacing a very serious bottleneck and restoring tight voltage responses to the electronics. So, if you're with me so far... is it any coincidence that the iPhones have no ability to change batteries by the user? In my opinion, it is a bold move to force the consumer into a buy cycle on apple/at&t's terms (oh, a ""battery replacement"" costs a (hypothetical) $100? Well that brand new iphone 8 is only $150, I might as well upgrade! And its about time to renew my contract anyways...)

"I had this phone for 1 month before returning it back to the Cingular Store. Although the phone is innovative and a sure beauty, there are some unfortunate flaws that compelled me to return it. Pros: - Great reception here in the city. It could pick up a signal and hold it better than my roommates' phones (Motorolas, another Samsung). - Beautiful phone: color and design is very attractive, and I loved the slide function b/c it was so different from the candy bar and clamshell shaped phones - AMAZING screen. It's large, sharp, colorful, and bright. - Quadband GSM phone, so you could take it just about anywhere and use it, which was a definite appeal to me b/c I travel a lot - Modern phone w/ a lot of the latest new features (ex: quadband, edge, bluetooth) found in newly released phones, so I guess it's pretty high end for a standard phone that's NOT a smartphone. - Decent battery. I didn't have to charge it every day (maybe every other day), even though I talked on it for about 1-2 hrs on it everyday. Cons: - VERY LOW VOLUME!!! This is the worst thing about the phone. Outside, it's very hard to hear someone talking or to hear an incoming call (ie: walking down the street in the middle of the day). I've definitely missed calls b/c the volume was too soft, and it was VERY difficult to hear the other end of the conversation when I did receive a call in public. - Not many accessories came with the phone, so you'll have to buy your own case, USB cord, memory card, etc, and they're all pretty expensive. Considering how expensive the phone is w/o having to renew yourself into another 2 yr contract w/ Cingular, I expected at least a small memory card or even a case! - I felt like the menu was a bit unintuitive. Many of the cooler applications (alarm clock, calculator, timer, mp3 player, etc) seemed to be buried deep w/in the menu, and you really had to dig through the menu to find them. - There aren't that many applications/etc that come built into the software of the phone for more personalization. For example, there was a very limited number of ring tones that were part of the software, and they weren't even that good. The 2 games on it are trial versions. I paid $299 for the phone, and I felt like I paid too much for what I was getting. It's a great phone, but I wouldve liked it more if the volume was a louder, and it had come with more accessories (considering the price tag). Maybe I'm hard of hearing, but I'm pretty young so I know I'm not deaf. If you have hearing impairments, then this phone might not be for you, and if you don't mind a softer volume, then go ahead and try the phone out. One last note: it gets smudged a lot. Maybe it's b/c the phone is black that the smudges are more noticeable, but after a few uses you'll notice how much your fingerprints leave a mark! Overall, great phone with some flaws.",neutral,neutral,0.06534969762555445,0.9151706503500622,0.01947965202438336
"EDIT: I took a star off because after using it for a 8 - 12 months and the volume is getting quieter and quieter and harder to hear. I am having to order another one, might try another brand.

"I really wanted to like the N78 - filled to the brim with all sorts of features in a very attractive case - but it was just too buggy to live with. Being able to set the phone up as a wireless access point using the brilliant JoikuSpot download was incredible, and certainly one of the things I'll miss most as I repackaged this and ship it back to Amazon. I feel (or at least hope) that my unit was just defective, so take some of the issues I had with a grain of salt - it may not happen on all devices, but here are some of the things I experienced: 1. Camera zoom stopped working after the first picture taken. It's a digital zoom, so not the most critical thing in the world, but still annoying when you want to frame a shot and can't. This was fixed when performing a factory reset using the *#7370# combination, however once I tried re-importing contacts, the camera zoom would break again. 2. I kept getting the phone's welcome message - about twice a day - no damnit, I don't want to see an introductory video on how to use the phone, leave me alone already! 3. Browser would crash and freeze constantly. 4. Phone would randomly restart - like right after going into Contacts to make a call. What I liked * JoikuSpot. One of the primary reasons I bought a Nokia - the ability to have a 3G based wireless access point on me at all times is really powerful and useful. * Screen. Bright, crisp, very nicely done * Design. Obviously very subjective, but I enjoyed looking at it in my hand - not something you can say about most Nokias * Predictive text. Coming from an old Motorola, I hadn't realized how horrible I had it. * Internet radio. I don't use my phone too much for music, but having all those internet radio stations has come in handy a few times and it's a pretty handy feature. What I didn't like: * Sluggish interface. This is my first Nokia smartphone, so I was expecting to see it fly based on all the reviews comparing this to previous Nokia models. There was a noticeable lag in everything I did. With fewer than 20 contacts on my phone, it took 1-2 seconds to load my list of contacts - meaning I couldn't just press ""Contacts + first letter"" to start filtering names right away - I had to pause for a second or two. * Menu-laden UI. I know there are plenty of shortcuts for this, but really, somebody needs to be taken out back and put out of their misery for the ridiculous number of menu options put in this phone. How often do people really make video calls - does that really have to be a default option when d-padding a contact's phone number? * Slow default browser. Opera Mini was orders of magnitude faster, but links from emails still open in the default browser, so having that suck still makes things frustratingly slow * Lack of camera lens cover. Not having it makes me nervous about ever putting the phone down on a hard surface Overall, I gave it 3 stars because I really liked the form factor, the screen, and just the sheer power of what it could do. If I could be assured that a new N78 wouldn't have the obvious issues mine had, I'd probably give it another go as there's really nothing else out on the market that has all this has for those in US 3G territory until the Xperia X1 comes out.",neutral,neutral,0.3514443548989828,0.5429412597396869,0.10561438536133029

"This is an absolute must-have for anyone with an LCD-display phone. It's true, though, that it does take some care, finesse, good light, and fingernails to apply the protective shield to the screen. Mine came with a set of two (inner & outer displays), and a small swatch of pink microfiber cloth for cleaning the screens. The protective shields are themselves covered on both sides by a clear plastic film that must be removed. There is a label on each side telling you in what order they should be removed and how to install the shield. You do have to flick up the invisible edge of the film with your fingernail before you can pull it off. The inner surface of the shield is adhesive, but it can be removed and repositioned. It isn't as easy as it sounds to get it positioned perfectly, and I found that I couldn't completely get every bubble pressed out. However, once I put my case back on the outside of the phone and turned it on, I couldn't see the bubbles at all. For something so thin, it's amazingly sturdy. It also seems impervious to fingerprints, and the display is just as clear and bright with it on. The little cleaning cloth should also be handy for glasses and camera lenses. The problem one reviewer had with the shield touching the keypad must be particular to that phone.

"I rate this phone about a 3.0 just because of what happened to it when owning. My uncle and I got the same phone around the same time. His failed when texting, he would text someone and it would never get to them and show the pending symbol in the status in messaging. So insurance replaced the phone for no fee because it was so new. So he got his new phone which consisted of the very much dreaded volume bug He ended up getting the 4650. My experience was as follows, I had the phone for about 6 months, and it got washed. I'll admit it was users fault, but I've washed countless phones even a chocolate and it survived, this phone died, I took it apart, and tried to see what was the matter, after still 4 weeks of sitting nothing happened and it was dead. Being as I had invested in the insurance, I got the new phone and had, had no problems with it until it was laying on my table. I was in the basement playing pool and the phone was dropped. like 2 feet, and what did it end up doing. It messed up something in the keypad, the numbers I pressed came out differently.

"Pro: I bought a second set of these, one set for my wife, after I fell in love with mine. The sound quality is great and they fit snug and secure blocking out ambient noise. They have a good max volume and nice bass response. They definitely beat out ANY pair of in-ear headphones I have even owned. And I even own a very expensive pair of in-ear monitors that I'd trade in a heartbeat for the sound of these bluetooth headphones. Con: After about 6 weeks of heavy usage with my first pair, the very thin plastic began to crack over my right ear. Due to the cracked plastic, they lost some of their snug fit. I used some electrical tape to fix them, but the tape also made them less comfortable to wear. Shortly after this, the left side cracked, too. Taped it, too, but the crack was considerably worse. It wound up cracking all the way through and was only held together by the wiring. Taped again. They work still but they are uncomfortable to wear, they don't get a snug fit so I get ambient noise and have some volume loss. Lucky for me, my wife never uses hers, so I do. But, I am very careful with them while in use as well as where I store them. I would recommend these despite the trouble I have had due to their sound quality and relatively affordable cost, however I would also suggest that they be very cautiously handled and stored.",neutral,neutral,0.07371854710345127,0.8404112778370653,0.08587017505948347

"I recently moved to Phoenix, Arizona, and thought it a good time to get a new mobile phone. A friend recommended Nextel, saying we'd use the direct connect function. Cool.

"I didn't think I would say this, but the Jawbone, though its loop is annoyingly cumbersome to get around the ear in a hurry, is actually better. I was hoping that this Etymotic would be a better headset, well, it's about the same sound quality but loses in the comfort level. Do you like them ear plugs that block out the noise? That weird sensation of your ear being plugged? Well, this Bluetooth headset uses the same plugged-in-your-ear technology of the rubbery tri-level ear-plug to shove it in your ear nice and tight, to block out ambient noise. One problem: if you are not having a conversation, then you feel like your ear is really just plugged, as if you are deaf in that one ear - which is the function of that rubbery ear-plug!!! So, for me, while I am driving, it is seriously dangerous. I can hear damn well out of one ear but because the other one is so plugged, it is un-balancing, if you get my meaning? None of the ear pieces offered in the package sit comfortably in my ear. Besides, I do not like things shoved that far in my ear anyways, nor do I want to be so plugged that it is lopsided like that. If the plugged-in sensation is both ears and I am a musician then it's fine, since I will have both ears plugged this way - but to be one-sided like this made me feel like a freak. I like the overall look and design, but because the piece that is supposed to go in your ear has a piece that sticks out so far, it sort of dangles out from my cheek and I wish it would sit more flush. I have to use the loop over the ear, otherwise it is too far from my face and I end up feeling like I have to shout to get my point across. I was hoping that the extension microphone piece would help, but with that plugged-up feeling being so strong, I really can't tell if this is any better. I keep asking people if they can hear me OK but I'm not sure. Ah well - the search continues for the perfect Bluetooth headset. To this day nothing beats bringing the whole cellphone to my face - it just sounds so much clearer. I am amazed that there aren't more, super-cool designed Bluetooth headsets out there - I guess people still don't mind putting the hot cellphone to their faces - and may be these bluetooth headsets are too expensive for what they are. They ought to be giving these damned things away by now.

"As with most places, the cellphone laws are beginning to be implemented, not just in the United States, but in other Countries as well. Blueant did a pretty good job with the Supertooth 3, despite its shortcomings... Firstly, it is a good looking system... gloss piano black with simple buttons and a magnetic clip for your car's visor. The size is comparable to the original iphone when it first came out but not the same weight of course. The multi language setup is a plus (recommend the british language as it is best sounding) and pairing with a Sony Ericsson test phone was pretty fast... uploading the contact list from the phone in less than 3 minutes. On a call it would say the person's name or is it's not in your list, the full number. Speaker quality is good although it tends to be drowned out by cars with heavy exhausts and the windows down. You also have the option of voice answering or manually pressing the buttons... Now in that light there are some bad news... some people carry more than one phone for use and while Blueant states that it can be paird with up to 8 phones, you can only use one at a time... so if you use 2 phones, this one isn't for you. There were issues to pair Nokia phones with the symbian software. The 6120 classic which we tested would not allow the contacts to auto upload to the supertooth 3 and we had to manually do so. Also we found that incoming calls from the Nokia were not listed on the Supertooth's system and you had to manually press the phone's button instead of the speakerphone to answer. Dual sim phones also had a slight problem as well. Call Quality was up and down, but more good than bad. People sometimes said you would ""echo"" as if you had an earpiece headset and again depenting on the road noise and the drone of heavy exhausts, the mic may get drowned out. Windows up though it was quite sufficient and to a point even clearer than the newer S4 that supports multipont. The buttons also were a little hard to press while driving and you had to hold it a while to shut it off. But don't let these things deter you from buying this speakerphone. It is a good system if you have one phone and unless we were doing something wrong to pair them, we recommend not using this with nokia symbian software phones. Also if you have a sports car or any vehicle that is loud bear in mind that your noise may drown out your quality. Overall good product for the price.",neutral,neutral,0.03227624726263893,0.8811241389334948,0.08659961380386612

"First of all, let me make it known that I used this headset with a Bluetooth enabled laptop computer rather than with a Bluetooth enabled mobile phone. That being said, I bought this headset on the advice of one of Best Buy's ""geeks"" that roam their store who assured me that it would work great as a computer headset as well. Setting up the headset to work with a computer was easy once I read the directions. I had no problem with the configuration of this product or getting it to respond to my Bluetooth enabled laptop (read the easy to follow directions). My complaint was with the volume levels. Both the headphones and microphone volume were only marginal. I looked everywhere in the Bluetooth configuration menus on my laptop to adjust the volume for both the headphone and microphone volume adjustment, but they were not to be found. As a result, people could only barely hear me and I could hear them only in a more quieter environment. I sent a request for help to the Motorola support web site, and got back what appeared to be an outsource to a third world reply of ""Response:"" followed by the same list of three URLs that I had previously been shown by their ""knowledgebase"". At that, I put all of the parts back into the package that it came with and took it back for a full refund. Again, this review should only be used by someone who is thinking about using this headset with a computer instead of a Bluetooth enabled mobile phone. I did not try it with a mobile phone, so it may work perfectly well with one. All I am saying is that if you're looking for a Bluetooth headset to use with a computer, then this is probably not your best choice.",negative,negative,0.5000092975300453,0.3325164813063815,0.16747422116357327
"The S-2 was easy to set up and did almost all that it claimed to do (though I could not make the one-touch voice command work...I had to start voice command through my phone menu, then it functioned OK through the headphones). The sound was good, both for listening to music and to voice calls, though people on the other end complained of a bit of echo. The basic concerns I have about the S-2 are that the bluetooth reception seemed to be rather weak. I actually had to start wearing my phone on my right side because when it was on my left side reception would cut out every time I turned my head (for both music and voice). Also, after less than 2-weeks use the arm that holds the right-side headphone broke. It was just in my backpack with a few other light items. When I pulled it out, it was broken. I don't throw my backpack around or treat it carelessly. My expectation is for my headphones to at least be able to survive normal activity and every day wear and tear. If you are going to do anything other than take these off and leave them in the car or on a table when you are done with them, think twice before you purchase the S-2 headphones.",neutral,neutral,0.38850686318884947,0.587099412043151,0.02439372476799949

"I am using this to keep my Garmin Nuvi 360 powered up while driving. I didn't know this when I got it, but if the Garmin is plugged in and not using battery power, it automatically turns on when the car is turned on (that's what I get for not reading the instruction manual, lol). To have a cleaner appearance in the car, I have the mini-usb plugged into the ball mount that is holding the GPS and not plugged into the GPS itself. Unfortunately, that port is really close to the ball mount which restricts it's movement when plugged in. With the adapter, it makes the cable less intrusive and makes the GPS free to adjust with the ball mount to nearly any position desired.

"This is a great product, but it isn't assembled correctly. Luckily, there's an easy way to fix tour turbo charge with a piece of aluminum foil. First, open up the battery area and find the battery contact that's covered by a piece of plastic with half a circle cut out of it. This contact doesn't work because the bumps on the metal behind the plastic isn't directly lined up with the half circle. To fix the problem, take a bit of aluminum foil about 1X4 inches and fold it over both ways to make a long strip. Size doesn't really matter that much. Next, bend the two ends and put the strip into the end of the battery compartment (without springs) so that it lines the wall and blocks both metal contacts. Now, put the batteries in, but push the springs in more so that the batteries pin the strip to the wall but don't move it out of place. You can now put the battery cover on and the charger should work. This works because the metal at the end of the battery case only has the job of connecting the two batteries. If it didn't work, check that the ends of both batteries are touching the foil. Also check that the foil is at the side of the battery case without springs and that the batteries are aligned the right way (one of the batteries has the positive end touching the spring unlike most battery cases). If that didn't work, then the problem with your charger wasn't the contacts at the end of the battery case.",neutral,neutral,0.3124608178736078,0.6647598846527306,0.022779297473661676

"I tried. I really, really tried. But this system is absolutely worthless in my situation. For background, I have held an Amateur Radio (HAM) license since I was in my teens (have held my Extra class for more than a dozen years). I have even written articles on antennas for the monthly Amateur Radio magazine. In other words, I think I know a little bit about how these things work. That said, I have been totally unsuccessful in getting this cell phone amplifier to work for me. First, the outside antenna (the flat panel) is worthless. Flimsy plastic unit that sits in a box you mount on the house or a tree. Supposed to be directional, but really hard to get it properly aimed. But, more important, the amplifier just doesn't work. For one thing, the amplification varies widely--from full scale, to no signal at all. Imagine how successful you can be making a call when the signal fluctuates that much. Also, the amplifier does not transmit a 3G (let alone 4G) signal. I can stand on the one corner of our front porch where we get limited signal and see one bar of 3G service. However, when I move inside and put the phone directly in front of the inside antenna, I don't even see 1X. Tried it with more than one phone (different brands)--same issues. I had a nice chat with one of the Wilson techs--he was quite pleasant and even sent me the better outside directional antenna at no charge. Helped by getting a little stronger signal (still fluctuates a lot). However, the unit is still unusable and it won't transmit 3G. So, I give up. It's obviously well past the return period and the warranty has expired. My fault. Suffice to say that I am very, very disappointed with this purchase and would not recommend it to others.",negative,negative,0.904828610560023,0.057084439490607736,0.038086949949369335

"THE SHORT: WARNING: IT'S NOT DESIGNED TO FIT iPhone. It will scratch the edges of iPhone when sliding into place. And if you have a protective cover on, it won't fit at all. Also, the adjustable wings are difficult to select the right sizes for your devices. Either too tight or too loose. When too loose, your device will rattle or bounce out of the cradle. THE LONG: I bought this piece in an attempt to update the current setup of Bracketron in my Audi A4 which I put together before the existence of iPhones. My setup consist of the Custom Bezel Mount (CBM), the Ultra-Slim Swivel, and the PHM-201PB. The PHM-201PB basically consists of the PH-Mini4 (the device holder) and the AMPs adapter (the T-notch adapter). With the exception of the the PH-Mini4 cradle, everything else from Bracketron is top-rate! Very well thought out design, easy to install, good quality, and very versatile. The T-notch adapter and the swivels works wonderfully. I would have rate these at 4.5 stars easily. Now, here's my complaints on the IPM-202BL (the reviewed item here): (1) It consist of the same PH-Mini4 that predates iPhone. No updates was done other than repackaging and re-part numbering. (2) It's false-marketed to fit iPhone. It really doesn't. It'll scratch the iPhone. (3) The Bracketron part numbering is rather confusing. If I'd known the same PH-Mini4 is part of the package.

"This is a sleek little phone that I wish so very much would work better. I had it for two weeks.

I understand the the cell phone is a little big compared to the other cell phones but think about with how many cell phones can you take a picture quality as good as the Nokia 3650? How many cell phones can you connect your laptop to the modem in the cell phone and also I don't think many cell phone come with a video recorder. Looking at all these features in a small gadget like this I am amazed at the sleekness of the 3650 phone. I have now been using it for quite sometime and I am happy with the performance.

"Pros: 1. Very small and lightweight. Rubber earpiece is very comfortable, you may forget you are wearing it. 2. Stylish and attractive. 3. Calls USUALLY are clear and crisp. Other party seems to hear me fine as well. 4. Voice Isolation feature works incredibly well. 5. Company stands behind products with frequent upgrades with USB 6. Quality built and feel when pressing the buttons. Con: 1. Rubber earpiece starts to degrade after a few months from oils/sweat and heat from your ear. 2. Updating to latest version is a bit confusing which may turn away some buyers. 3. Turning on and off Voice Isolation is the button as hanging up/picking up phone calls, which can be tricky to control. 4. Seems to lose connection to my phone quite often. (T-Mobile Shadow, Nokia 6133, Samsung U600 and D900.) Well basically I used this for about a few months. In the first couple months the headset worked great. My callers heard me clear and crisp. The voice isolation feature worked as stated. But everything went downhill after that. First my rubber ear piece started to deform which caused the headset to not fit properly in my ear. I do not use the hook as it interferes with my glasses. Calls I made and received started to lose reception. Clear and crispness was no longer there. I updated the software hoping it would help but that seem to screw up the button features. It started not pick up calls when I pressed the main button and instead would activate or deactivate the Voice isolation feature. It would disconnect with my phone and I would have to reset it by turning it off. A couple of times it totally lost pairing with my phone where I then had to pair it up again. Basically, when the headset worked it worked exceptionally but when it started to act up it was horrendous. It is a good headset but comes down to the reliability of it which I feel is not there. The 3 stars is for when it did worked.",neutral,neutral,0.04301576312218658,0.9438985094682385,0.013085727409574872
"I purchased Jawbone headset a couple months ago and I am totally thrilled. At first I hesitated because it is a bit pricey, but after a few phone calls I discovered it is worth every penny.

"Nice, sturdy barrier but not a great option for a 2013 Nissan Murano. My roof in the cargo area has two different heights due to the lift gate mechanism inside the roof. We needed an extension piece for the top leg to connect to the higher roof area but was unable to get one. I called the company, but was told they don't have extra parts (??) and I would need to purchase another barrier and use it for extra parts. Not a feasible option for me, so right now three legs are secure and one is not.

"Anakin's Episode 3 saber is by far one of the better and more advanced versions Master Replica could ever come up with. While other units used Floursent tubes and poor sound quality, the new Episode 3 saber uses 60+ Rowed LED lights which give a realistic Up and Down power motion. The blade's color and brightness has also increased by nearly 20% compared to Episode 2 styles. The sensors have been tuned so it doesn't make the swung noise as easily unless swung unlike Vader's Episode 5 saber. Also the battle clashing sounds have been improved. Unlike other models, Anakin's Episode 3 has atleast 3 different battle clashes which feel more realistic. Everything from a burning clash down too a quick jolt against another saber. The hilt/handle is a chrome coated diecast metal with rubber grips for easy gripping. The power on/off switch is comfortably located near your thumb if positioned correctly and must be firmly pressed to turn on or off so you won't do something by accident like turning it off during some minor play time. While Master Replica has stated that dueling with other MR sabers is okay but not recommended, I also agree. However I have seen these bashed around a few times from hard core collectors and nothing bad will really occur unless you go all out violent with these. The blades are incased in a durable hard plastic coating over the strobe LED lights. But still, I recommend moderate dueling with caution, don't swing these around as hard as you would as HASBRO toy. Master Replica has really outdone themselves and continue to do so in the future with other Light Saber releases for 2006.",positive,neutral,0.24490163363525072,0.4511411359432793,0.3039572304214699
"After looking around in local stores here and seeing the cheaper sleeve cases, I decided to go for this product and pay a little bit extra. I think I should have paid more attention to the picture, since the picture clearly shows a gap between the sleeve and the top of the phone. I was expecting a better fit. Second thing is the ""Exclusive EasyReach system"". It's not that exclusive, since most sleeve cases have this, but the new sleeve I bought after buying this one is much smoother than the ""system"" used in the incipio sleeve case.

"When switching to Verizon from another wireless carrier, I initially bought 6 of the VX5200 for my on-call staff. Within 24 hours, all of them had come to me and complained about their phones. Complaints included: Ring tones that were too soft, Flimsy flip mechanisms in the phone's hinge, The annoying chiming noise the phone makes every time you turn it on or turn it off (and we couldn't find a way to disable it), Cheap feel of the phone, Some of the menus didn't make much sense, Poor reception quality inside the buildings Overall, they were not happy with the phones and didn't feel comfortable using them so I had to take them back and get the motorola E815. There was not much good about the phones other than the: Ability to take pictures, Decent quality speakerphone, Bright screens, Final Recommendation: The phone bravely offers a lot of features for the dollar and were it not for the poor reception and poor build quality, which are deal breakers for me, I would have made my staff stay with this phone. Get this phone only if: 1) this phone fits your budget and/or 2) you don't care about the above listed complaints as this phone will work for those who just need to dial the numbers they need to call.",negative,negative,0.7808104248145673,0.19097440675802446,0.028215168427408267

Say, for instance, you want the 4th option of the menu, then 3rd, then 5th, all you have to do is press Menu, 4,3, then 5, and you are there. I love the phone quality, and the reception (incoming) is as good as the outgoing. My cellphone is better than any phones I have used at home, and those are on Digital Cable Phone lines. One worry I quickly fixed was a dedicated WAP / ON-LINE button. I simply gave the WAP address an incorrect symbol (put a . where it did not belong) and it won't access the internet when I accidentally press the button.

Within 5 minutes of getting the phone out of the box, I broke the ear piece just trying to get the headset over my ear. I put the headset in my piece and bent the second piece. The plastic piece covering the control buttons seemed very cheap also, and I think it would be a matter of time before that broke as well. I generally take good care of my headsets and electronic equipment, so if the headset seemed fragile to me, it probably will for most. Also, as a woman with a small head, the headset just felt clumsy and big.

"Well, I was so anxious for a bluetooth phone, I bought the Flare. I couldn't beat the price for something with that technology, and the only reason I want bluetooth is for to use wireless headsets at last! For this I deactivate my perfectly good MTV Edition V5 Slider, and after an afternoon of entering my address book on a new phone, I already miss having a Kyocera. Right now, Life's not so Good. Before, with my V5, all I had to do was push the up button for my balance, and the right button to set the phone to vibrate, along with the usual on/off buttons. With the LG Flare, I have to push a menu button, find the ""my account"" button, wait for it to launch a browser, which is scary because I have no intention of paying for web content. Then, once the balance shows, without warning like my Kyocera did, you hit the red phone to get out of it, and the web browser icon remains on the phone. I hate that! You go through just about the same rigmarole to set the phone to vibrate. The owner's manual doesn't even mention vibrate in the index, so I'm better off downloading the PDF from Virgin Mobile's website so that I can keyword search the document! I've managed to turn down the funky ringtone volume (I miss my Kyocera ringtones, too - I don't want rap music on my phone!) Entering text is a headache no matter what phone you have, so re-entering my contact list is once again a chore. I learned my lesson from my first VM phone, though, and I only put the important people in! It's a lot to get used to, and a downside to phones with no SIM card. But I don't need complicated phones! I need 'em to make and take calls, and that's it. So why did I buy it in the first place? As mentioned before, the opportunity for a wireless headset which my beloved Kyoceras don't have. Also, the phone is a handsome little thing! It's about the same size as my slider when closed, but it not as thick. When the clamshell is opened, it gives the impression of being a much bigger phone, which I like. I've set the backlighting to dim, but when an incoming call comes in, a window lights up on the outside of the clamshell where the time is. One thing I did notice is the time it takes to get going when it's been turned on. It says ""HELLO"" in big letters, almost like my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/JVC-XV-N40BK-Progressive-Scan-Slim-DVD-Player-Black/dp/B00008N6X1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">JVC XV-N40BK Progressive-Scan Slim DVD Player (Black)</a>&nbsp;did, and when you turn it off, it says ""BYE"" in big letters that show up on both the inside and the outside screen. It's gimmicky stuff that I think is actually kind of neat. After two days I don't yet know if I'll keep it - almost as soon as I bought this I heard of a new slider phone coming for Virgin Mobile made by Samsung! Maybe one day Kyocera will make a bluetooth slider for Virgin Mobile - BESIDES the Slider Sonic - that doesn't cost too much that I can love. I'll never pay $100 for a phone, whether it's landline or wireless. I loved my cheap little slider - and sliders in general. But, after three phones with Virgin Mobile, first the sturdy K9 Royale, then my trusty V5 slider, this is my first non-Kyocera phone I've had in the four years I've been with Virgin Mobile. Maybe I'll learn to like it more as I live with it. I'm willing to give it a chance in the meantime. I've heard good things about LG, so we'll see. One thing about Virgin Mobile phones - if I don't like it, it won't cost me a two-year contract or an arm and a leg to change it!",neutral,neutral,0.032619390411607135,0.8957148184403934,0.07166579114799931

"I'm a devoted fan of touchscreen devices: iPad, iPod Touch, Droid phone...I have them all. The only problem with that is that sometimes I'm away from a power source and one of my devices is running out of power. Enter the IMP500! This amazing power pack can charge an iPod Touch three times from one charge! So no matter where I am, I can always charge my devices on the go. The really awesome part is that the IMP500 comes with a retractable cable with several adapters, so I'm always covered. Need to charge the iPod or iPad? There's an adapter for that! Need to charge the Droid? There's an adapter for that too! When my Droid is running low on battery, I can slip the IMP500 into my pocket and plug it into my Droid phone which is clipped to my belt, so it charges as I walk around; the best of both worlds: my phone stays with me if I need to answer a call, and charges at the same time!

"I shopped for battery extenders for my iPhone 3Gs over a period of several months before deciding to buy the Imax Power IMP500. I didn't like the idea of the ""attached"" extenders I read about with other units because they looked cumbersome to hold, would interfere with my car mount, and battery life was more limited. When I found the Imax IMP500, I was able to watch a ""You-tube"" demonstration showing how it worked. I quickly decided to buy it based on huge capacity, a ""retractable cable"" connection to the iPhone for more flexible use, adapters for other devices, and great price for the capabilities. It has met my expectations in every way. I don't use it often, but when I do need it, I know that I don't have to worry about capacity. Recently my original iPhone car charger quit working so I simply use the IMAX instead. The only problem that I had was quickly remedied by outstanding customer support. I had broken the iPhone/Imax connector when I put the iPhone and the Imax both in my Levis front pocket while it was charging. Apparently the connector got ""tweaked"" when I bent over (pants too tight) and it broke. I sent an email to Imax customer support and also called the phone number provided. I was surprised to get connected with John within a few minutes and he quickly offered to replace the broken part at no charge. I received a new (looks like an improved design) connector in the mail and I'm now able to use the Imax again. I am being more careful about how I carry it but the flexibility it offers is great. I focus on quality when I buy and this is a good example of a high quality product with high quality support at a very reasonable price.

"I am a Nokia user ever since I started using mobile phones and I also have Nokia N800. After in hyper excitement mode ordering Nokia N95, I am quite disappointed. 1) The browsing in N95 is not quite friendly at all. 2) It doesn't 'just works' So many user tweaks needed on the phone to use its functionalities. 3) After using a iPod Touch and seeing a iPhone, iPhone trumps N95 on ease of use, looks, screen. While N95 is the king in specifications and features, for me I think I would go with iphone as ease of use is one of my main reason. 4) For Techies can put so much into technical settings and installing and finding various applications and N95 is the best choice! (I learnt a bad lesson by buying Nokia N800 which is not 'General User Friendly' at all compared to IPod Touch. I am not a apple fanboy but after using both Apple Products and Nokia Products, I feel that If I go with Apple I will always have stuff that 'just works' and so intuitive and friendly to use! I am returning the same and will be going for a iphone! Update : 3 days after N95 8GB 1) I am feeling that my right side slider has become bit loose. The left side remains perfect while the right one becomes wobbly. 2) An annoying bug in which memory card has to be reformatted as my video recording pauses every 10-15 seconds and continues again. Not able to get continuous recording. For a 640$ device (which say in mobiles is a very significant investment) these bugs are really annoying and completely unsatisfactory. Update : One week after N95 Hmm tough one.. There are some items which takes time to get used to it.. kind of 'acquired taste'. I would put N95 into that category. Though it may not 'wow' me like iPhone whenever I touch the phone, the versatility is amazing. The kind of apps available and freedom to used bluetooth keyboard, easy tethering with N800,nice applications to use makes this device a swiss army knife. I have decided to keep it with me albeit tolerating some minor annoyances (""acquired taste"" / ""undocumented 'features' "" ). **** Update 2 weeks later! I am liking the phone! Like the feel when pressing the keys! Got used to the phone... Things going pretty smooth. Installed lots of applications without much trouble. Camera quality is pretty good for a mobile phone camera. Volume from music player is great. Though Video player (real player) doesnt support too many formats. Need thirdparty applications. **** 2 Months Later ***** The Gallery is slow!! Believe me it takes atleast 45 seconds to 2 minutes to load the gallery after you have taken a picture to see a thumbnail of the picture if you have even a modest number say 75 pictures totally!! Completely unacceptable in a 600$ gadget! When I have to show my pictures to someone its like taking whole age just to get a thumbnail while everyone just open their stuff to show the pic! Sometimes the phone becomes sluggish and needs restart couple of times a week... There are a lot of nice applications and one can choose as per their needs... The s60 browser sucks a bit and I would recommend opera mini over s60 browser any day! Overall I am still having some positive view over the phone but the gallery load time alone will make me to think twice before buying the phone again...as I got this as mainly for my mobile camera usage and i cant even see the pictures in my mobile easily without waiting for 2 mintues or so.... There are no other phones with similar tech specifications in terms of hardware... but if i have to go over the process again... i may go with iphone 3g for the ease of use and the usablity unless nokia fixes these issues my next purchase wouldnt be a nokia device! 5 Months Later... The phone is utterly annoying... and unbelievably slow.... just load 50 odd photos and it takes for ever to open the gallery... frequent reboots.... slow hang-ups... I have wasted my money....

"The mobility concept is great on this phone. It has a base unit that acts as a charger for the phone and the headset. For quick calls, just pick up the cell phone style phone and talk; it has a small speaker and microphone on the face. You can also switch on the speakerphone which may be OK for certain uses but otherwise sounds like your in a cave. In both of these functions it performs pretty much as expected. Where the main problem lies is with the Bluetooth headset. I have had 3 replacements and the last time they replaced the entire set from a different production batch, all in hopes of solving my only problem: The headset generates an intermittent pop-corn popping sound that is so irritating to you and the person you're calling that it drives everybody crazy.

"I chose this product because I used a previous BT Headset from Motorola of the same general design (I believe it was the HS850). It is smaller and fits in my pocket better. It is louder than the previous model that I had, which is better in a slightly noisy environment. I do like the ability to turn the device on and off by opening and closing the boom.

"This is the third ""Motorola"" headseat carrying case I have bought... My husband used one till he wore it out, lost the second one (along with the headset) and the first two were actual Motorola branded products. This says it is Motorola in the title ""Malcom Distributors Headset EVA Carrying Pouch Case MD BLT-04 compatible with Motorola H500 H550 H670 H700 H710 H715 H721 H730 HS850 H350 H300 H3 HS820 HS810 Bluetooth Headset by Motorola"" (copied and pasted that directly from this page).... but instead of the signature M like in the photo (and I believed I was getting that because of the ""by Motorola""), the actual case I received has ""MD"" on it and is much cheaper made than the previous cases. If it says ""by Motorola"", you would logically conclude that Malcom Distributors are a Motorola distributor, and the ""compatible with Motorola H500 H550 ..."" etc., is just telling you which Motorola headsets will fit this case. When I clicked on ""Review this product"" and started typing, the photo next to the product name is the photo of the actual case I received, with the MD on it. This is the kind of business practice that leads me to question whether the company can be trusted. It could be an oversight, but I don't believe so, if the stock photo of a Motorola case was all that was used, it would be easier to believe that the company is not trying to make customers believe they are getting a branded Motorola product. I wanted the actual Motorola case, because I have used that exact product before and knew it's quality, I have nothing against knock-off brands as long as they are well made enough to suit my needs, I don't believe this one will hold up well for very long.

"Just got the Sidekick II and spent literally an hour with tech support trying to get around a bug. They said nobody before had asked them that question. I call a lot overseas and, surely, don't dial directly due to the cost. I use a calling card, a pin and then the number. Even the oldest cell phones have a much longer field length on the phone number, so that you can program the calling card (10 digits), the pin (10 digits) and a foreign number (12+ digits). The Sidekick II stops on the 28th digit! What an annoyance. I found, however, that if I use the speed dial function, the field length is not restricted. With only 9 speed dials, though, this is not much help. Another bug is that if you do a select-copy-paste on a phone, and copy the number to another speed dial (so I don;t have to type the calling card for every entry), it pastes the whole seeting, including the name and then doesn't let you change it. A third bug is that the phone does not allow you to save a draft of a text message. If you are not able to send a message (system outage etc), you can't just save the message to send later, but you have to retype it. Looks like the Sidekick II does not allow any change in color, plates or walpaper either. I like the phone - it's fun and very intuitive, but at this time I am pondering whether to return it and stick with my Nokia 3650 which gives me all of the same, just without the bugs. I activated a new account with TMobile, but I have little hope they'll let me carry over my old number. My plan was just to cancel the old service..but I may give it a try if I keep the phone. I wish these engineers didn't sleep on the job and stopped these annoying bugs from happening. After all, how hard is it to set a longer text field, if you are setting it on the speed dial anyway.. Oh...did I say the phone also doesn't allow you to add a memory card? Good toy, though...I am nervous about putting work data on it, keeping in mind TMobile has access to it. Sure their servers are secure, but so are all banks...and they do have crackdowns from time to time.. So...still thinking about it..",neutral,neutral,0.4396745981755552,0.5396518572768836,0.020673544547561387

"Like a lot of other reviewers, I've also owned several different models of headsets. This unit is by far the most wearable and usable headset I've used which include the Jawbone, other Plantronics and Motorola models. The compact and light-weight design makes it possible to use this headset without an ear-band. This is particularly important for people, like me, who wear glasses. This headset is so easy to slip on and off your ear. No more two-handed operation. It is also very comfortable to wear and it doesn't bother my ear even after an extended period of use. In comparison, the Jawbone is not as comfortable and often pinches my ear after a while. The voice quality is good but not the best, I give the Jawbone an edge on this. Nonetheless this unit gave me the most reliable voice dialing accuracy. The other units, Jawbone included, are just not consistent enough for me to use voice-dialing. This model does not come with an a/c adaptor. Rather you can recharge it through a computer USB port or a car charger and both of which are included in this model. To my surprise, my computer USB port is hot even when it is in sleep mode. So recharging can be conveniently accomplished this way.

My only issue is that the various menu interfaces are not as intuitive as sprint phone software menue interfaces.

"I really like my 60CSx and the car mount is excellent, but this mount needs better engineering. The mount itself only fits a few sizes of handle bars and it's hard to get the ends of the clamp lined up and get the screw going straight into the plastic. It won't take a lot to strip the plastic threads. I figure if you take it off 4 to 6 times, it'll be history. There is no way to change the angle of the mount without removing the mount and repositioning it. If the sun is reflecting off it into your eyes, too bad. The piece that connects the GPS to the mount is a pretty good setup and seems to work OK for a bicycle. In a car, the power cord interferes with taking the GPS on and off and you need to grind off a corner of the plastic piece, but on a bike this is a non issue.

"This is my first BT headset, so I do not have a comparison to make. However, the Soyo headset met all my expectations, and I am happier with it that a lot of owners of other BT headsets based on their reviews. I use it almost exclusively in my car to keep my hands on the wheel. It is easy to use, and connects automatically whenever it is in turned on. Also, if I leave the vicinity of my phone, the headset beeps to warn me, and it automatically reconnects when I'm in range again. I've seen others complain about reconnection, but mine has been absolutely automatic. Even if I transfer an active call to my phone, the headset will reconnect to receive the next one. Voices are clear to me and mine is clear to others. I bought one for my wife, and recommended it to my brother who was using a Motorola (don't know the model, and I'm a big Motorola fan, so I'm not bashing)that was much more expensive, but giving him problems. He is much more happier with the Soyo, though he says the range is not as good. This is not a problem for me, as I rarely use this at home or work where I may walk away from the phone. You can buy several of these, as they will not interfere with each other when used for different phones; I've seen three work flawlessly with their resepective phones in the same room. The headset is very comfortable. It also includes a corded microphone that clips to your collar. I have not tried this option, but my brother's girlfriend uses hers this way and likes it. The ""ear hanger"" is detachable so you can reverse it for left or right ear use, but I have found the headset will suspend in my ear from the earbud. It will easily fall out if you're moving around, but is perfect for me in the car as I leave it on the seat, and can quickly put it in my ear when the phone rings. It's also good to let the kids use it this way when grandma calls, because their ears are too small to work with the hanger. The flashing blue light is annoying as others have said. It draws attention to you when you're walking in a crowd, is a distraction to people in a face-to-face conversation, and is annoying in the car at night. For the 1st and 2nd reason, I use mine in the car exclusively. For the price, you can try it, and give it to your favorite teenager if you don't like it.",positive,positive,0.006994924804066031,0.39399261066554664,0.5990124645303874

"Maybe the sound quality is superior to other headsets, but it was so difficult to get to fit comfortably and properly that I gave up and returned it to Amazon. I paid $75 when it was on sale, but that's still a lot of money for a headset. It always felt like it was going to fall off, and underneath what looks like a slim body is a big lump where I guess all the electronics are. The buttons were difficult to find and operate when in place. If you look at the earloop in the picture, the outside is metal ,about the weight of a heavy paperclip, and the part that appears black is actually soft rubber stretched inside the 'paperclip' frame. Kinda hard to describe better than that. I don't remember but I think you get 4 sets of very similar earloops, two for each side, depending on which ear you use. And I think 3 sets of earpieces, also quite similar, and none that fit my ear snugly. If you can make it fit on your ear, the sound quality really was quite good. But if you can't get a good fit, it doesn't really matter how good the sound is. I kind of felt like I had to walk around with my head tilted to balance this thing on my ear. It never felt secure. Obviously if I returned it, it was not a satisfying purchase. Luckily, because of Amazon's generous return policy, they refunded all my money, including shipping costs since it was 'incompatible' with my ear.",neutral,neutral,0.11307788119832164,0.8802335235667759,0.0066885952349025595

"I've been wondering for quite some time, why I can't find a decent Bluetooth headset for a decent price (I've purchased 3 so far, this being the third). I am very frugal (you may swap that word for cheap if you like) and I like bargains. Buying bargain Bluetooth headsets has it's disadvantages, one being that they don't work well. This is not true of the LG-HBM-760. This headset has very strong reception with my LG Voyager phone without crackling. The sound quality is great, sounds better than the headset on the phone. While making calls, I'm told I sound great as well (no muffling effect). That is all I want. I don't want special bells and whistles, just clear sound when I'm driving in my very old and loud automobile. I haven't tried the headset yet in a windy environment, so I can't tell you how that behaves, but I don't plan on using my Bluetooth headset when I'm walking or jogging, only when I'm driving. Overall, Great product from LG. Pros: Nice and easy fit over the ear. Easy pairing process Easy to make calls Quick charging Very clear sound quality on both ends Cons: Takes a while to turn on and off",positive,positive,0.000727817702107345,0.01634393700887889,0.9829282452890139
"I previously owned an H700 headset and based on my great experience I purchased the H12. I was especially interested in the H12's noise cancelling feature. Was I disappointed. First, the fit is not nearly as natural as the H700. The earpiece must go into the ear canal and it never stays put even with the alternate size foam cushions that are supplied. People I converse with while using the H12 are constantly telling me that I am breaking up even when we both have excellent reception (5 bars). People I spoke with via the H700 and my Blackberry never mentioned a problem. Also, the volume of the headset is more difficult to adjust, maybe because of the ear cusion but a couple of times I almost deafened myself by adjusting the earpiece to too loud a setting. Maybe my fault but still a nuisance. The noise cancelling feature doesn't seem to work but that may also be due to the ill fitting design. I don't know and I don't care. I am so aware of this annoying thing in my ear that I don't even use it anymore. In my opinion get the H700 and fall in love with bluetooth.",negative,neutral,0.11253913597966818,0.7858393413415302,0.10162152267880166

"UPDATE: i was able to connect this device only to the Sony ericcson phone and this device has failed to connect to any other phone after that. I have tried multiple brands of phones like Nokia, LG etc but none of them seem to connect to this device even though the phones seem to support this device. So, this was a complete waste of my money. I have not used this device in 2 years because of this issue. Infact i have a similar problem with my other Jabra Bluetooth headset. It connected to my Nokia E71 and refuses to connect to any other device! DO NOT BUY THIS DEVICE OR ANY JABRA DEVICE! the moment i saw this, i was floored and the reviews were very good ..i have purchased this product and have been using this for about 2 months now. So far, no problems at all. I purchased this device so that i can easily listen to songs in the gym from my cell phone instead of carrying my ol mp3 player also. it can easily connect with most modern bluetooth enabled phones without any issues. Though I was UNABLE to connect to my samsung phone, i know that it was my phone's problem rather than the gadget. Samsung phones block one of the ports for bluetooth which enables the bluetooth phone to connect to devices (Samsung claims that this is done to prevent viruses from using this port to access the phone and destroying it. No other phone company does this to their phones!). I was able to seamlessly connect this device to my other sony Ericsson phone almost instantaneously. So, if you guys have a Samsung mobile phone, then don't waste your money on this gadget or for that matter any blue tooth gadget. The only gadgets samsung allows are the blue tooth headsets (since they use a different port). But this Jabra device is a breeze to setup and use. I can change tracks using the buttons on the device and this device does everything that the manufacturers claim... one thing you might want to consider is that this device is not really good if you want to use it in the gym while you are running on the treadmill/ or on the track since the gadget keeps bouncing off your chest when you are running.

"I wanted to be able to watch tv late at night without having to disturb others in the house to I got these last week to pair with my motorola DC800 stereo adapter (which I first tried to pair with my laptop to stream music from my onkyo stereo to laptop as streaming from laptop to onkyo using dc800 already works flawlessly but I wanted to see if I could get away with not having to buy bluetooth headphone and instead stream sound to my laptop speakers and then use normal headphones on laptop but alas, it doesn't work that way).

"Pros: Held the phone as advertised. Cons: 1. The release mechanism is hard to actuate. You have pull up on the release, while holding the belt clip down, you could then pull the phone up, opposite of other phone holders. 2. The knob that fits into the belt clip is in the center of the phone. When you take the phone off the clip it is near impossible to know what orientation the phone is, if it was towards the top it would be easier to know that the phone is upright or upside down. 3. The plastic that covers the phone is a trap for dirt and requires a regular cleaning. 4. When the phone is opened the case can slide on the phone, it usually slid up and covered the ear speaker, making it hard to hear. This also becomes a problem if you want to use the RAZRs' built in camera. I literally through my case in the garbage after several weeks of trying to get to like it.

"I titled this ""Purchase these for the right reason"" because i should have done my homework before buying these earphones. The one and only purpose I intended to use these earphones for was to listen to music while I am at the gym, or walking from class to class. I really had no desire to use them for ""conversation"" purposes.... So it has a mic on it, no biggie they are usually located on the chord around the chest area which i will hide under my shirt. THINK AGAIN! the right earphone chord (before they intersect at the mic) is about a foot n half long. The chord to the left earphone... a lengthy 5 inches. so in order for me to have music playing in both ears, there is a heavy mic piece resting on the left side of my jaw bone, and an extra 7 inches of useless cord dangling underneath my chin going to the right ear.

"I purchased the Jabra JX10 after doing a lot of research, both here and on many other sites. If you have not seen the headset, it is very discreet and fashionable as advertised. The headset charged in exactly 2 hours using the usb charger included. Pairing with my Samsung A900 was a snap. The unit is extremely light and very comfortable on the ear using the supplied ear clip (I wear glasses and the ear clip was never in the way or the least bit uncomfortable). The first few calls made were crystal clear, so long as I had my phone on the same side as the headset. Issue #1: I was not able to get anywhere near 30ft away from the phone (more like 3 feet) before I experienced static. The same day I purchased the JX-10, and shortly after fully charging the headset, I went to the mall to do some more shopping. During the drive to the mall, I was able to talk on the headset with the windows down without any complaint from the person on the other end of the call. As a matter of fact, I don't think they even noticed I had taken the call from home to the car, even while driving with the windows down. I guess the DSP really does work. Issue #2: Once in the mall the headset became unusable. I became frustrated and turned the Jabra off and started using my phone to complete my call. The sound would drop in and out. While in it was crystal clear, when it dropped out there wasn't any static, just no sound. Again all the while, even with the issues I was experiencing on my end of the call, I don't think the caller knew I was on a headset during the sound issues. I returned the Jabra the same evening after the visit to the mall. I couldn't justify the price for the poor performance. With that said...many people seem to be having good luck with the JX-10. My advise, if you purchase any headset, put it through the paces as soon as you can in order to find out if it is right for you or not. I plan to try the Discovery 645. ***Update 7/30/06*** When I did this review of the JX-10 awhile back I rated it 3 stars because it was plagued with static (on my end). I extremely disappointed the JX-10 didn't perform for me, to the same standards so many reported in their glowing commentaries. After going without a Bluetooth headset for a time, I began to reflect on the good qualities I did experience. I jumped at the opportunity to purchase another JX-10 when the price dropped. I am happy to proclaim the JX-10 is as good as others have reported! Beware, the second unit I purchased a was defective and had to be exchanged, which led me to believe the first unit I purchased, a month or two ago, may have also been defective. I would go as far as saying, if your JX-10 doesn't immediately exceed your expectations in performance, call Jabra customer service for support or exchange the unit. You may find this information important: My provider is Sprint and my phone model is the Samsung A900. I'm glad I gave the JX-10 a second (third) chance because it is truly an extremely high-end, high quality Bluetooth headset.

This cover really does feel like rubber though it is painted plastic. It fits well and securely and will not come off unless the phone is subjected to some pretty rough handling. I don't think it would offer much protection should the phone be dropped but it will protect it from scratches and other cosmetic damage. The phone will still look like new after the cover is removed. The phone is fully functional with the cover on and can be opened and closed without the cover getting in the way. It doesn't add a whole lot of bulk or weight to the phone and there is a hole on the back if you want to add a belt clip.

"I purchased this because I lost an iPod Touch from a Nite Ize case that had a velcro flap. The flap came open the iPod was history. This case has the same durable belt loop but the zippers are a HUGE disappointment. I've only had this case since mid December and one zipper has completely broken off the product. The real trouble is that it needs to be a bit larger just a 1/4 inch or so so an iPod Touch can be easily inserted and removed. My Touch has a rubberized wrap around it that means you have to pull the zipper just a little harder. Too hard this time. Before this happened the string on one zipper fell off. That was easy to fix. Nite Ize has the ONLY cases that STAY on your belt. They set the industry standard for folks in uniform EXCEPT when it comes to zipping, sealing, and keeping what's in their product safely inside.

"My last Motorola phone was a Dynatac 8000G, and it worked great for years. A few months ago, I bought a Z6m and now hate not just the phone, but Motorola. (The Z6m is the CDMA variant; I've observed that all sorts of GSM phones regularly cause interference, violating US FCC rules part 15, and therefore unlawful to operate.) The first thing that infuriated me was the speakerphone. It isn't loud enough to use in a moving car, even when holding it near my head. (Under the same conditions, my old Nokia worked just fine, allowing me to keep both hands on the steering wheel.) The MP3 player can play plenty loud through the same speaker, indicating to me that it's not the fault of the speaker, but an intentional shortcoming designed to sell Motorola's hands-free car kit. Even while using all the power-saving options, I still can't get a second day's use out of the phone before recharging, and that's with a brand-new battery. My Nokia gave me a week. The phone supports adding a memory card only up to 2GiB because it uses FAT16 and not FAT32. It would be nice to offer a non-Microsoft file system, if only Motorola could get the disk interface right. Plug in a USB cable to a computer and it charges the phone, and allows access to the memory (card if installed or main if not) or the modem. See something you want to take a picture of? Hold down the button and wait. It launches the camera application, so wait some more. The moment is long gone. I went somewhere with no service and quickly learned that I couldn't even set the clock to the right time. Want to browse the Web? Forget it. The designs of many parts of this thing were outsourced and clearly not managed competently. This is the last Motorola product I buy. I feel ripped off, and hope to soon replace the phone and punch any of its designers in the nose.",negative,negative,0.8854296702612271,0.0555260118112028,0.05904431792757008

"I have had this phone for 2 months now. First, the Good Size, Call Quality, User Interface, Volume, Virgin pricing plans, web extras. It is very thin and can be stuck in any pocket without making it look like you just shoplifted half the store. The call quality has been excellent, much like my 2 previous phones from sprint were (Virgin runs off of the Sprint PCS network for those who didn't know). The interface is clean and simple for anyone to use. The volume of the call is loud and clear as is the ringer - I have yet to not hear the phone ringing in my pocket (one of my biggest problems with my last Samsung phone). Virgin has really simple pre-paid pricing plans with a well organized and useful website. Virgin offers lots of ringtones and wallpaper online at 2 bucks a pop as well as celebrity voice mail & rescue ringtones. Now, the bad Button size, battery life, built in extras. The buttons are very small and can be difficult to operate if you have large hands (Once the phone book is programmed this becomes much less of an issue). This phone will not stay charged for more than 1 day - even if no calls are made. I have to make sure I charge it every night or else it becomes useless - this is my biggest complaint about this phone. There are hardly any backgrounds or ringtones that come with the phone.

"I use this kit when I travel to more rural places where signal is missing or weak, or deflected by metal. It works. Understand: it's not magic. You have to actually have signal running around up there to catch. It won't generate signal where there is none.

I use it where the location is down a hill, and inside a metal covered, metal roofed building, and the locale is far enough out into the hinterlands that the tower network is sparse.

The only time this thing did what they claim it does is when I was within 25 feet from it, with no obstacles. So, if you are planning to use the cell phone while been basically next to the base station, sure it works; otherwise, don't waste your money.

"Given 1 star for the easy access to songs/artist/albums/shuffle, and another for decent battery life and the mini usb/usb charging capabilities. It's all down hill from there. I must warn all of you, the phone I bought from hasselfree(or whatever they changed their name to) came shipped to me as a Russian phone. Russian text on the keys(just looks lame). I feel like a complete idiot for buying this phone. However, I was desperite and needed one fast and thought, ""why not for 100 bucks"". This might not bother some, but the listed images reflecting the item purchased is not correct. Firmware updates are not available from Motorola. T-Mobile updates are not available. You'll have to do some research in order to find the correct settings for your phone. Took me about a week. My previous phones were all synched seemlessly intergrated. This phone also has TONS of lag when browsing through menus. Doesn't matter what type, but I have found that, bluetooth will only add to the delay. The other thing I was gonna add is fact that the phone is in RUSSIAN. What's really weird about this phone is the speakerphone. While playing music, it's great(for a phone) but during a phone call, it's average. The speakerphone volume changes, why? I dunno. But it does, and it disapointed me as soon as I tried using it for a phone call. Couldn't find any setting to try and tweak it. Bluetooth connections with headset pieces are sad compared to my last two phones, z6 and samsung. Lots of digital static as if the phone was 20' or 30' away even though the ear piece and phone are less than 4' away from each other(cell in pocket/bluetooth headset in ear). I've used this phone for a more than 4 months and haven't had too many problems. The cell phone's reception compared to the two previous phones is a 7/10. I used to get a solid reception in my bedroom, now I have to go outside and stand infront of a planter in order to NOT drop a call. Though the expandable memory and internal memory sound like a plus. The phone's internal system just added to the lag. I kept everything on the SD card. Thought this phone should have been called the lag. Even with a brebone system with 1 mp3 on it, the phone still lags. Really sad because this phone really looks cool! 9/19/09 I just added the data plan, omg... one thing to say... NEVER BUY A RANDOM UNLOCKED PHONE ever ever ever... Saving a few bucks just isn't worth the headache... buy the real thing. Hasslefree or whatever they call themselves now asked why in an automated email... ""what can we do to help you?"" full well knowing the crap they were selling. This phone is just 100% pure jacked up. EVERYTHING needs to be reset to a factory default that isn't available ANYWHERE! You're going to be the one researching/plugging in everything... on your own. In all, screw this phone. It looks awesome! but yeah... most guys/girls that I know don't twitter their junk to a outdated cell phone.

"I got this one a month ago from t-mobile. 99+tax. Had to take a data plan as well with this(they made me take it).

Pearl has stunning looks and its way better in terms of weight, functionality compared to the other Blackberry models.

I had to spend a lots of time on the internet to figure out that, i have to take the battery out and put is back in to get its sound back. I did and it worked. But then the same problem again. It was not worth the money and a 2 year contract. So went back to t-mobile and returned. THings to watchout for. No OEM case/cover available. Keys get presses easily. Body is not that strong, can easily crack. 1.3 MP Camera is mediocre. And the keypad is really uncomfortable, esp to those who have used the simple ABC types before.

"The phone arrived about a week after I ordered it. The back of the phone would not stay snapped on with the battery in place, and I sent email to the vendor, but it was the subsequent seller feedback that produced a response. We swapped about one email a day regarding the back cover. I do not know if the fellow was busy, or if I was on a leash. (I suspect the latter.) After about four days of emails, the seller sent a new cover. I have not yet received said cover, though the email tells me it's in the mail, but being in a hurry, I applied tape to the back cover, and proceeded to get the phone ready for use. I had forgotten the pure simplicity that is this phone. However, that pleasure was not to last. First, the phone is not new as indicated in the sales copy. It's a refurbished device that was first sold for use on the T-Mobile network, which is apparent when the phone comes on. It's also apparent from the back cover being a different shade of silver from the rest of the phone, and then, of course, there's the problem with the cover popping off. The phone makes calls. It sends texts. It will take pics. However, it will not send a picture to another phone (MMS). After some delay, an error message appears on the screen indicating a ""send"" error. There is no suggestion I've found for tweaking the network settings to make MMS function. I'm at a loss regarding what to do about this phone. Update (25 October 2010) The replacement cover arrived today. It is wrong on two counts. First, it has two tabs at the bottom whereas the phone only has one slot. Second, the cover is too short. I sent return email to that effect. Update (28 October 2010) Yesterday, the seller requested the IMEI number for the phone. I suppose the intent is to resolve the MMS issue. Given that T-Mobile and AT&T do not appear to use the same frequency for 3G, I doubt much will happen there. Then again, the seller could be looking for a back cover that fits AND stays on. Update (29 October 2010) After sending the IMEI number for the phone twice yesterday, it was requested once more today. The request came with a note that a return shipping label would soon be sent. Update (02 December 2010) Toward the middle of November, this mess all ended. The phone returned to the vendor.

"I started with a Nokia bluetooth earpiece that was awful. I could hardly hear the people on the phone at all. Moving to this device was certainly an improvement over that. All in all it was a nice looking unit and the battery does last forever. When it does finaly get low, there is an audable beep that lets you know that it is time for a recharge. You know it is charging because the blue light comes on and stays on until it is fully charged. It could be quite startling when using the earpiece in a car at night as the blue flashing light reflecting off of the glass was exactly the same color as a police car light! I learned quickly to open the mic and put the unit on while pushing the button to answer a call. It is quick and fairly easy to put on with some practice. However it does flop around if you turn your head, and if you wear glasses it becomes signifigantly more uncomfortable. The biggest drawbacks for me are the difficulty hearing callers. I have exceptional hearing, and I am constantly wishing I could turn up the volume. Also people who call me often complaied of static. I wore the headset on my left ear, and I found I had to have the phone on a desk in front of me, or on my belt right over my left front pocket of my pants. If I wore it on my right hip, or even on my left hip under my arm. My own body was enough to block the signal. I had to have line-of-sight between the phone and the earpiece. About once per week, the headset and my phone (Treo 650) would mysteriously uncouple and I would need to mate them again. and the last straw was when the microphone on the headset quit working just as the warranty ended. I can still use the headset to listen to voicemail, but that just isn't good enough.",neutral,neutral,0.12764547101387036,0.7207226098456865,0.1516319191404432

"This little charger works really well, but I do not recommend storing it with the phone's cord plugged in. When the metal on my phone cord's charging end makes contact with the metal border around the charger, it will spark and short the whole thing out. From there, the only way to get the charger working again is to plug it back into the micro-USB charger, which resets everything. Not a huge deal, but the sparks are concerning, and I don't know why the charger even needs that metal border in the first place. It seems aesthetic, and dangerous. I have since stopped storing the charger with a phone cord plugged into it, and only plug the cord in when I am ready to charge my phone. Otherwise, the product is great.

"I got this PDA for one week and became extremely disappointed. I had used Palm Treo 300. By far, it could not come close to Palm in term of easy to use, stable, intuitive. You have to navigate many times to get you want. This probably is not important for you. I intended to use the PDA to read ebooks and listening to MP3. Unfortunately, it fails in both areas miserably. First, there are not many quality programs for smartphone. I tried Orneta reader and ClearVue PDF reader. cleareVue pdf reader just could not open any pdf file (internal error).

"Got the unit in today. In my studio I get a solid one bar. If the phone rings I have to go stand by a window or often it will drop out. Big pain. If an important call comes in, I grab my phone and run to my porch to answer it. I used to have Verizon and the signal was great, but years ago I switched to AT&T so I could get an iPhone, and then I moved half a mile away...further from the tower, and my signal sucked. But I have a contract and a family plan of revolving phones, so I'm stuck with AT&T for a while. But this device looked like it could solve my problems. Unpacked the unit, mounted the antenna where I found 3 bars (on my cell) on my back porch roof. Ran the coax through my soffit into my attic and down one of the several 2' PVC pipes I had wisely installed when rebuilding my house. I run all sorts of stuff down these pipes, if you ever build, or rebuild a house and love electronics, this is a life-saver. They provide two lengths of coax and a coupler. Even though I didn't go far, the length of coax worked great, since I was dropping down a wall, out and up through my workstation table and then over to the inside unit location. I plugged everything in, got the green light on the unit and turned on my phone. Four bars. Wonderful. I called my wife to make sure it was a clear-sounding call and it was. Only reason for not doing 5 stars is because the unit doesn't broadcast that far. At my desk, 3 feet from the antenna, it's great. But when I walk around the house, the signal drops quickly. I can go about 30 feet away to my bedroom, and I'm back to one bar. Note, I'm pointing the antenna at the far side of the house, not towards my desk. I'm actually pointing the antenna away from me. If you're going to call it a 'home' unit, then the signal should transmit the area of a normal house. The only obstacle between the door of my room and the antenna is a wood and drywall wall. BUT, I'm glad that when an important client calls I don't have to scurry to my porch to make sure I don't have any problems on the call. So, bottom line, solid purchase and well worth the money. Wonder if I could buy an extra antenna and split the signal from the inside unit. I'll give Wilson a call.

"It's soo cool, it arrives in a beautiful transparent display case with all the trimmings and it just looks like you bought a gem. Yes, it does not fit perfectly, but working on the bits and tids you can make it. Then you realize how poorly this device has been designed.

How can anybody but an idiot embed the only one functional button you need in the whole external surface of the device?

This is bad, I mean really bad, maddening in fact, but it's nothing compared to the other beautiful feature: you switch it off and put it somewhere, it does not matter where, in your pocket, in your bag, in a cup holder, whatever. You can be sure that the next time your telephone rings you will find yourself shouting into the handset ""hello! hello!"" but no, the bloody thing has switched itself on (it just needs a little pressure, there is no safe place) and it is now paired with the phone, so your telephone is not usable anymore unless you find the Jawbone (which could be in another room for what you know, in your bag for example).

"Este es el cuarto auricular bluetooth que compro. Hasta ahora, siempre haba utilizado el Motorola H700 que es sumamente pequeo, con muy buen diseo y calidad. PERO muy sensible fsicamente por lo que no me duraba mucho. Buscaba el mismo o uno similar con una relacin de precio/calidad razonable y, basado en las opiniones de los usuarios, me decid por este. Reconozco que con ciertas dudas ya que estas no eran 100% favorables. Hasta ahora, puedo decir que me parece un excelente producto.

"This Wireless Blue Tooth Headset has awesome sound and it is relatively easy to you. I worked for it if they had cloth type covering instead of the fake leather or less sweating, but it isn't that bad (summer is coming though). They should also have changeable ear piece covers, see that fake leather covering eventually cracking. And if they were cloth and changeable then you could wash them. Where is the confusion? Well it is with pairing. You hold in the phone button for pairing either the phone or the music source causing confusion in the device or at least in me. I would suggest that the company make the phone button for the phone pairing and the music button for the music source pairing. I install my phone like it says and then I try the computer for music I hear music, but I can't control windows media player to review said they were able to do, but also then the phone un-paired. And back and forth. I am wondering is because I have a music phone that the headset is thinking well you have music and phone. Not sure. I plan on keeping them though. I still have to call customer support. Maybe it is something I have set wrong in my computer. Or I am Doing something wrong.",neutral,neutral,0.31624691411388184,0.6565005335729834,0.02725255231313485
I Got This phone for Easter and I absolutly ADORE it! It is so cute and trendy and i love the handel antenna. The only bad things are the phone is very slippery. I have dropped it twice. IT SURVIVED THOUGH! it is still in perfect condition. Another is that it is hard to open with one hand. It also CLIKs when you open it. The buttons on the side are also very easy to hit. The camera button is on the side and it was hard to find at first. But the phone has very many cute features. Like you can choose your background colore and the pictures are very unique!!!

"The description of this case is overstated. It is simply a slim rubber case, and at that it is a decent one. It adds very little bulk, and in fact blends in to the point some people will think your phone does not have a case. Very sharp-looking. And I can't speak for all shipping destinations, but I got this super-fast: I ordered it Sunday night and got it Tuesday. But the description really made me expect it to do everything including mow the lawn. A few nit-picks that may be relevant to users: -- Being so low-profile, I would expect it to provide very little shock protection, if any at all. I'll be careful not to drop my phone! -- It is all one piece of rubber, just with two finishes. I did not think that was clear in the description. -- The matte finish is slick. I cannot use it one-handed if I'm touching the matte finish. The glossing finish is nice and sticky, making it easy to hold. Unfortunately, the glossy finish is only about 20% of the back! -- The ""grippy"" sides are not so grippy. Trying to use the phone one-handed with my fingers wrapped around the far side, they slip off. I would have expected the textured side edges to be very easy to grip. They are not. -- If you're a perfectionist, you ought to know that the feature cut-outs do not center over the features. I think all of my features still work (I can plug in the charger and headphone jack, the camera is not obstructed, etc.), but if you care about alignment you'll notice this. The power and volume rocker bumps are a little out of alignment as well, which doesn't affect your ability to use them, as long as you squeeze where they are, and not on the bumps themselves. Overall I'm not displeased with this purchase, but I wish i hadn't paid $11 for it. Other than aesthetics it has nothing on the $0.99 rubber cases out there, and it's probably not as easy to hold as they are.",neutral,neutral,0.19160313824642747,0.7405496533204938,0.0678472084330787

"At least I got all the pieces to this one, as the last one I got was missing the antenna and I had to ship it back. I set this up in my office, and got the green LED, acknowledging the unit was powered up. Put my LG G4 in the cradle and saw no change in the reception bars. Pulled up the dB meter in the phone setting and after several rounds of testing determined that the booster was having no effect at all , a 0dB gain in signal strength under any conditions. Just to make sure the booster was defective, I brought in an older Wilson Electronics Sleek that I have been using successfully in my home for a few years now. I used the weBoost antenna with the older cradle and it worked great, 8-12dB of gain without even fussing with it. I also noted that this thing got very warm, almost hot. My older Wilson Electronics Sleek has never been anything but room temperature . I was already a bit leery when I saw the company had changed its name, as this rarely if ever spells an improved product from any entity.

Also, when not it direct line with the phone, such as in another room and a good 20 feet away. One of the reasons I like this headset is because once it's on your ear it stays on. You could run, jump, ect without fear of it falling off. It picks up my voice really well and others hear without any problems. I gave this a 4/5 because of the static/signal problem and the fact that it is a bit tricky to get on when you are in a hurry.

It's build solidly, it looks nice, reflects sound nicely and has a well-designed ipod connector (tilts forward to connct, then leans back for support on stand). Sorry to say - keep looking.",negative,neutral,0.03400829437567362,0.9117910737745628,0.05420063184976357
"Don't waste your time and money! I purchased this phone for my husband along with 60 minutes via TracFone's web site. We received the phone on time as promised but the 60 minutes phone card was 3 weeks late. It took us 4 calls to their Customer Service (which I may add is the poster child of how bad customer service can be!) to activate the phone each time we called we wore told to wait 24 to 48 hours. About 2 months after activating the phone we purchased additional air time at local store. We activated it on line and the minute balance did go up however the renewal date did not change. We assumed that it would change on that expiration day as we wore 4 weeks ahead of the due date. On the expiration date the phone stopped working. Customer Service was of no use and very hard to understand. We wore forced to purchase additional air time and forgo the minutes that ""expired"" on our phone! The last time our phone expired BEFORE our due date I had enough and decided to get a monthly payment cell phone for both me and my husband that averages out to about the same payment as what we paid for one TracFone!",negative,negative,0.8489990795468257,0.10772387672417984,0.04327704372899422

I've been using a Treo 700w for 6 months now and I love it... My time management has improved significantly because of it and I'm able to view and edit my Microsoft Office documents on the run! In addition I like its great email support features.. I have multiple accounts that I need to use and the Treo makes it very convenient for me to deal with all of those.,positive,positive,0.001401326397096358,0.08611042639812218,0.9124882472047814
"Its an ok phone that would be my starting title! why is this, its because the phone its relatively a good phone but you cant compare it to an iPhone after using an iPhone you are just expecting the same features as the iPhone. This is because this phone doesnt let me use an app to check my mac.com email directly from the phone like my iPhone neither its going to be easy setting it up your yahoo or any other non-microsoft application. Youtube works and you can see it ok but not as good as the os from mac that is installed in the iPhone, btw i bought this phone because i was sick and tired of doing workarounds to my hacked iphone so i could use it here in the Republic of Panama. This is a great phone when we talk about the wifi which it gives you a good signal but this phone is not so user friendly and is kinda hard for a person to set it up to make it look like its part of you. This phone has great games though, the screen is great and the 2 megapixels are great! it has great features as video, video calls, night mode, etc! Overall ill give this phone a three stars just because i came from a Ferrari to a Toyota and i think ill stick with my hacked iphone meanwhile nokia comes with a better phone that actual competes against apple's iPhone.

"The title of this review says it all. I installed this item on my Honda Civic. Because the vent clips are too short, I am unable to position the cell phone at an angle that suits my purpose. Using it with another phone, a Blackberry, I find it hard to keep the phone securely in place. When I have to press buttons while the phone is on the cradle, the phone comes loose and falls off rather easily. The smaller phone (a Samsung flip phone) fares much better.",neutral,negative,0.5920840057079693,0.37363857008417545,0.03427742420785517
"the SMARTphone isn't so smart .... it doesn't have something so basic as a regular alarm clock!!!! if u want to set an alarm, u have to use the calendar (which clutters it up!) if u want a repeating alarm. if u set it with the world time option, it will only work for the next 24 hours, after which u need to set it again!!! pretty dumb, i think. if the manufacturer could put a gazillion other features in the phone, surely they could put in a regular alarm clock!! i wasn't looking into using the phone for internet so i had few qualms about returning it within a week! it was a really sleek, nice-looking phone though. its pix don't do it justice!",negative,negative,0.7802038904297947,0.19994535859586188,0.019850750974343464
"This phone is really cool and has tons of features, but is missing basic features like; easy and quick way of setting the phone on vibrate, ring tones are extremely low and short, there is no way of adding categories or customizing them to your contacts, etc. Update: This phone ended up dying after four months of use. There was no support or replacements available. This is the best example of caveat emptor (buyer beware) that I can think of... Such excellent potential and way ahead of its time, but not worth $5 now.",neutral,neutral,0.3839671654694182,0.5472626321924542,0.06877020233812768
"Personally I think this item is a good buy since there are so many blue tooth headsets out there that are very expensive and this one works in a pinch. However, it's not very loud and doesn't stay on the ear all that well. With 3 kids sitting in the backseat, it's sometimes hard to talk on the phone so I thought having this item would help but I actually still have to push it into my ear to be able to hear the person on the other end. Plus if I turn my head fast, it falls off. The clarity on the other end of the line is good but that's about all that I have to really compliment this item.",negative,negative,0.7408767055461293,0.2489251771796012,0.010198117274269518

"The product arrived as advertised and after reading many reviews I was all set for a great experience. Initially the product worked out well, good fit, easy to use, decent sound quality. It only took me two weeks to break the first ear loop. I called Aliph and although the girl was nice about sending me a free ear loop, she was adamant that I caused the problem. And mentioned that they sell ear loops on the web site and next time I would have to purchase a replacement. I figured at two weeks per loop life I was going to be spending some dollars on replacements. I was not wrong, the ear loops cannot handle any pressure and snap like a French fried potato. Although they look very sturdy, they break easily where the metal is halved to fit into the Jawbone. My guess is it is a casting issue, but Jawbone does not want to hear about that. I ordered four more loops from the web site and I am already down to having two left. One of the new ones broke after only two hours of use. The second problem I have faced is the charger pulls the back off the Jawbone when removing it after a charge. I have had the Jawbone now for about two months and use it everyday and have used the charger a few times, but certainly not excessively (is that possible for a charger?) so this was an unexpected event. Crazy glued it and now will see how it handles the next after charge separation. Bottom line, if the hardware cannot support the device, it really does not matter how good the electronics might be. As to the electronics/sound quality, reception, pairing..... Sound quality seems good. Pairing is easy although it will not pair with a Treo and another phone. It will pair with two phones if one is not a Treo. Sometimes it will not switch to the second phone after it has been used to answer a call on the other, but most times is switches over ok. I would not recommend this product and will keep searching for a product that delivers good construction, sound quality and reception. Alas, the search goes on, doesn't any body make a decent product?",negative,negative,0.6191112519807115,0.3772283486419141,0.0036603993773743557
