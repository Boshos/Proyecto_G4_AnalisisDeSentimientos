"I bought this hoping many of the stellar reviews would trump the many poor reviews, but unfortunately it turned out to not be the case for me. I ordered the item to be able to charge my new AT&T Inspire 4G, by HTC. It's a battery hog, so having a portable recharge would be great. I opened the box, and was really excited because the product is sexi to look at... it's not one of the dark black boxy electronics you usually associate with this type of product. It's curvy and nice looking. Initial read of the instructions proved to be a challenge, as it's clearly a manual that was written in Chinese and then translated and converted to english for North American sale. It was a bit contradictory and vague in a couple aspects, so I went online and watched the how-to, just so I could say with certainty I was using it properly. I charged it initially for 24 hours (it recommends 4-6 hours), and the instruction manual that came with it said one light will flash when it was completed charging. After 24 hours, TWO lights were still charging. I went onto their website and it states that when charging is complete, the light should remain on and solid. However this was not the case for me. I decided based on the specs, 24 hours should have been more than enough to charge it (by technological spec 5 hours from complete drain to full charge is all it should take). I plugged in my device, and immediately all 4 lights lit up on the battery pack indicating full capacity. After 5 minutes, it dropped to 3, then after 10 minutes it went to 2... At this point I contacted the manufacturer. They were quick to respond that it's likely defective. I questioned if they see this a lot and they said yes. I asked why they don't resolve it and they said (in broken english) that it was what people expect for half the price of the competition. Seems a bit odd of a response from them. To me I'd want to put out the best (usable) product for the price, or not put out a product, but hey, whatever. BOTTOM LINE: Amazon is issuing me a refund as I'm sending this one back. Normally I'd give the benefit of the doubt and re-order another one, but given the less than impressive response from the manufacturer, I'm planning on returning for a refund. I'm going to order the Zagg Sparq 2.0, which gets great reviews. At almost 2x the price, I'll have to suck it up and pay for it, but I suppose if I want a product that comes with warranty and support, that's the cost of it. I also learned that Amazon doesn't have a lot of flexibility in their marketplace seller practices, so they said their hands are tied. I'll stick to ordering direct from Amazon going forward. :-(",accessories,negative,negative,1.0
"I am disappointed. I had been wanting to purchase the Jawbone headset ever since it was first released as a wired version, but it was not compatible with the cell phone that I was using. I was ecstatic when they released a blue tooth version, and waited a bit for any bugs to be worked out, and for my old bluetooth headset to ""die"", which it did a couple of weeks ago. To make a long story short, I am deeply disappointed by the Jawbone head set. The first one that I received did not function as advertised; I wasn't certain if it was defective or if the geometry of my face was just ""wrong"" somehow, but I returned it for a replacement. The replacement does not work correctly either. I tried every fitting that I could: the standard and long ear loops on both ears, and all four of the ear pieces in every combination, with no discernible difference. I've returned it for a refund, and will be ordering a different headset (maybe two for the same price) when the refund goes through.",price,neutral,negative,1.0
"Do not purchase a Jawbone 2. In two month's time, I have had to replace the J2 twice. Amazon (good customer service) just agreed to accept the return of the second unit and refund the purchase price. The first J2 arrived defective: some of the earpieces were missing and the headphone dropped every second word. Aliph agreed to replace the first unit, but the replacement process was slow and expensive. First, I had to wait for an authorizing email - which took a couple of days to arrive. Then, I had to return the defective unit at my cost. Then Aliph took over a week to return the replacement. The replacement headphone never worked that well, but was initially functional. However, it has now failed and transmits only about 60-70% of my side of the conversation. Reception with both the first and second unit was not a problem, but the J2 is worthless if you actually want the other person to hear you. The original Jawbone (predecessor to the currently shipping J2) worked very well, except when there was any wind. The first original Jawbone I purchased also fell apart within 2 weeks of purchase, but was replaced by Aliph with no objection and no problem. The replacement original Jawbone worked very well and lasted well over a year, before it died completely. When I contacted Aliph regarding the failure of the second J2, Aliph refused to replace it with anything but another J2, which is clearly a defective product. I suspect that is the reason Aliph is now shipping the replacement Jawbone Prime. Don't waste time or money purchasing a J2. First, it is a defectively designed product and Aliph's customer service simply isn't. The only reason the J2 receives one star is because it is not possible to give it a zero.",audio,negative,negative,1.0
"I wanted to love this phone but it was not to be. First of all, the phone is pretty much as advertised. It is very basic, easy to use and physically small. It looks to be rugged and will most likely stand up to hard use. All the features (not many, I realize) are easily accessible. The sound quality and speaker phone are excellent. In summary, it's a no-nonsense phone for people who only want to make/receive calls and send/receive the occasional text message. Now the bad. In 2.5 months of use, the phone dropped many calls. Sometimes, the phone does not ring during incoming calls and the caller is sent straight to the voice mailbox. In those cases, due to a glitch with AT&T, there is nothing displayed on the phone to signify that a call was missed or a voice mail is waiting for you. You have no clue unless you call your voice mail so you must do this quite regularly to check for missed voice mails. I realize this may be a glitch with AT&T and may not apply to other carriers. Sometimes, calling the phone returns a message that service is temporarily unavailable in that area. I have no idea if this is the phone's fault but since the phone returns zero bars from time to time and drops calls, I have to assume the problems may be related. One may claim that some of these problems aren't the phone's fault. I can only respond that I have had a Nokia 6061 for years and under the same conditions, it has never dropped a call or exhibited any of these problems, so no matter what is causing the problems, the result is that the Motofone is not as useful or reliable as the Nokia. You may ask, with all these problems, why give it 2 stars? Simply because the design of the phone is unique and a breath of fresh air as compared to other cell phones. I'd gladly buy another such phone if the problems were cleared up and I hope they will be in time.",accessories,negative,negative,0.8
"This seemed like a pretty good headset at the start, getting it connected wasn't too difficult, the light weight/small size was awesome. But soon I did run into some cons: Connection to the headset had a tendency to break on a regular basis. Usually after I had made a few calls, and then received an incoming call. So like another reviewer mentioned I would be driving down the road with the headset in one ear and my phone on the other. The headset falls out often. I have a bigger then usual ear I guess, but still. Other headsets are adjustable in one way or another, this one is not. After a month of only periodic use, the sound quality has become horrible. LG has been less then helpful with this issue. Either my unit became damaged, or maybe it was defective from day one. Either way it's destined for the junk gadget pile now...",build_quality,negative,negative,0.8
"Love the looks, and the bluetooth headset rocks! But, when you pay 200 bucks for a phone it should be of very good quality. I read reviews here where people stated static/hum was a problem but I thought possibly they had received defective units. When I received the first phone it had a bad static hum. I use dsl, had the dsl filter installed, I disconnected the phone line and activated the handset and it still hummed. Thinking this may be line noise being generated by some device on this circuit, I plugged it into a different circuit, same thing. My old phone still works but with very low volume and I did not have this hum. Sent the unit back for a different one. The new one had the same problem, albeit not quite as bad at first, but within a week the problem progressed to the same level as the first phone. I returned the second unit also and will try something different. Now for my rant :) This product has a defective electronic component that is causing this static/hum, or a design flaw that doesn't handle normal electrical line noise. Because some reviews give this thing very high praise, but others do not, this leads me to believe that possibly Plantronics had units that were manufactured using a bad component or design, that they later resolved in new units, but are not pulling the defective/bad units from the market, and instead, are still selling them hoping people will just accept it. I'm not one of those who will, and in fact I will never buy Plantronics products again because they must be aware of this issue and are not being proactive in ensuring they are selling quality products. Far too common a practice these days. If you buy this, good luck.",audio,negative,negative,0.8
"I received the unit, and charged it as per instructions. All the features it had were excellent. The sound quality was terrible, it seems to have to much base, and the party I was talking to said I kept breaking up; this happened on all my calls and in different areas; so it eliminates location and other phone problems. I called their tech support which instructed me to adjust the boom away from my face and that may fix it. That did not work. I ended up returning the unit..... for me it was unusable. Which was to bad, because it was comfortable to wear and adjust. I research further on bluetooth earphones and found out that some units are more compatible with mobil phones. I guess I just have to find the one that is compatible with mine.",connectivity,negative,negative,0.8
"Let me say off the bat that I had been REALLY looking forward to getting this phone. I saw a great deal on Amazon and ordered it. However, when I tried to activate the phone it was listed in Sprint's database as a stolen phone! Obviously I sent the phone back to Amazon (along with a curt note!) and then bought one directly from Sprint. I loved it from the moment I took it out of the box... very slim, sleek, and sexy. I spent many, many hours setting up the phone just how I wanted it, including pictures, ring tones, and display preferences. I should have waited until I'd made sure the phone worked. Within a few uses I knew there were problems. Major ones. Over the course of two days I had the phone shut itself off and reboot randomly four times, display the incorrect caller ID and use the wrong ringtone for contacts, have the ringtones sounds like music played on an underwater stereo, and have the picture display show up like an old TV set with bad ""rabbit ears"" (remember those fuzzy, squiggly lines that would appear all over the screen if it wasn't a good signal?). I called Sprint and told them what I was experiencing. They said they hadn't heard of those complaints but would be glad to exchange it for me FOR $55 SINCE I DIDN'T HAVE A REPAIR CONTRACT WITH THEM! After I pointed out how ludicrus that was - charging me to swap a phone that was defective to begin with - they sent me another one free of charge. I was much smarter with the second phone and didn't program anything until I made sure it was working. Guess what? It had the SAME problems. Now I knew it wasn't just a fluke that my old one acted up. I then went to the Net and did some research, and it turns out that many, many people are experiencing the same problems I was (and yet Sprint still says they aren't hearing of these issues, which I find hard to believe). I once again called Sprint and had them send me out a 3rd phone. There was a 2 week gap between ordering and receipt and while I was mad at first that I was stuck for a while with a defective phone, it turned out to be a good thing bacause it allowed me to receive a phone from a new ""lot"". My 3rd A900 hasn't rebooted and hasn't played the incorrect ringtones. I was able to get around the scrambled-looking picture ID's with a tip I'd read from others who had experienced the problem. It occurs on long-distance numbers and apparently putting the ""1"" before the area code confuses the phone; if you remove it then the phone (and picture) works fine. I've now had the new phone for two weeks and think I'll keep it. I had already invested over $100 in accessories before I found out my first one didn't work so I am very hesitant to switch to a new phone (although Sprint offered to swap it out for a different - less expensive! - phone ""at no charge""). I'm going to be downloading my own ringers on to it later today and hope that it doesn't mess up the good thing I've finally got going. In short, if I had to buy this phone again I wouldn't.

Everyone I talk to complains so much about the sound quality that they are hearing, I end up turning it off so they don't have to experience terrible quality too. It's one thing if I deal with it for convenience, but another to subject someone else to it.

"All the hype ended with a worthless, clunky piece of useless plastic. Every button became non-responsive and useless. I have never been more compelled to share my experience in hopes that anyone looking at this phone will feel informed. I would guess many earlier reviews that shed such a positive light would change after some time of use by the consumers. My phone stopped working without any reason. Tmobile customer service told me that a list of about 20 problems relating to the phone continue to increase. In my case, after exhausting the list of tricks to fix it, the representative pleasantly informed me that the phone was broken and beyond fixing. This happened to occur 15 days after the year warranty expired. BUYER BEWARE! PROBLEMS and NUANCES: 1. Very cumbersome. Using the stylus and inputing data while talking is nearly impossible unless you feel important enough to wear an earpiece. The ""buttons"" on the screen are too close together. You will never use the backspace feature more than with this device. 2. Sound quality is horrible. I found myself pressing the phone so tight to my ear in order to hear. In the process, every other button becomes activated resulting in hang ups, dialing, redialing, activating email, etc. 3. Internet connection was so slow. By the time you retrieved an email, you could set up a lemonade stand, spend the summer making 10 cents a cup, purchase a desktop, hook up an email connection and still beat the time to retrieve an email on the device. Horrible. 4. Camera less than desirable. 5. Bulky 6. Stylus loosens, falls out, gets lost, all of which make it impossible to use the touch screen unless you have twigs for fingers or fingernails shaped to a tip. Currently I am using a 9.99 loner phone that has already made calling, answering, and checking voicemail 100x easier. Bigger, more expensive, and fancy DOES NOT always equate to being a better product. When Tmobile customer service reps and local store employees told me they think the phone is a horrible product and they do not recommend them to customers, the message is loud and clear.

"I live in a Mobile Home which has additional insulation and siding on the exterior as well as Energy Star windows with additional storm windows. As a result, the cell phone signal in my home is very weak. I have Sprint as a carrier and get a weak Sprint signal outside the home but no sprint signal inside the home. I do have a very weak Verizon signal inside the home so I could receive some phone calls inside the home but only if the phone was next to window and hooked up to charger. If the phone was not on the charger, the battery would drain within 24 hours because it was constantly searching for signal. After missing several calls and getting tired of having to go outside to make a call I had to do something. It was either pay the penalty for early termination for 2 phones with Sprint or purchase a Cell Phone Signal Booster. I opted to purchase the booster after reading several reviews on Amazon. The fact that I had 30 days to return it if it did not work made this an easy choice. I received the Wilson Signal Booster less than one week after I ordered it. I pointed the antenna toward my nearest Sprint tower and ran the included cable into my home. Within 30 minutes of opening the box, I was ready to try it out. The results were unbelievable. I now have full signal from Sprint anywhere in my home. I can make calls and receive calls with absolutely no problem. In addition, I now charge my phone every 4 days and the battery takes less than 30 minutes to take a full charge. My only regret is that I waited so long to purchase this item.",battery,positive,negative,0.6000000000000001
"Regarding this iPod wall charger... --- I wondered why the same product kept coming up with different prices. Maybe because they want to hide poor reviews and keep starting fresh? The first time I plugged it into my iPod, for a few minutes the backlight of the iPod turned on, but not the text. Then the light went off and I was not able to get the iPod to respond again for two hours. It was dead. I made sure the lock switch was off, I tried to reset, I plugged it in using the Apple brand charger that has been working fine...but nothing worked. It was gone. --- Perhaps it was a coincidence that, despite the iPod working fine for two years (including a couple of hours on a flight just yesterday), the first time I plugged it in to charge with this product, it died. However, it also seems possible that this product provided the wrong electrical supply to the iPod and fried it, at least temporarily. I don't feel like trying it on other iPods to test this theory, though. --- I thought I was getting a good deal by buying this for 1 cent and paying $4.99 shipping and handling.

Let me tell you first that I used LG HBS-730 for a while now but I was attracted by the stronger wires these headset seems to have. I am very disappointed by the product mainly due to conception flaws. I did not give 1 star due to the fact that I like there is a bit of competition on this niche. The good: - good range - wires seems more sturdy than on LG The bad: - the power button is hardly accessible - the power led is useless as you can not say if the product is on of off - no error sound - it makes the same sound if connected successfully or if it disconnect; - vague confirmation sound - same sound when you short press the answer button (nothing happened) and when you long press the answer button (voice command is opened) - voice confirmation is just for starting the headset - no notification when connection is lost - poor sound quality,audio,negative,negative,0.6000000000000001
"I decided to try this unit after people where complaining of the extra noise of my Plantronics. This audio on this unit is *terrible* it is harsh and not consistent, a lengthy phone call actually hurts. I had the unit replaced by Jawbone and the second unit, while a little better, was nowhere near the audio quality of the other headsets I have used. I never had a long enough call with anyone to see how good it was form their end, but tests I did in my car to voicemail showed the Jawbones voice quality to be subpar, it was low and muffled, where the BT8040 was clean and clear, as was the Plantronics. I won't even get into the freaky buttons. I also think they wasted a ton on the packaging, while real nice, I don't need money spent there. I did like the looks, the cool light (although hidden by the button, so it was very hard to tell when you turned it on) as well as the charging cable. I did not like the way it fit as the ear piece was way too big, and the ear hooks all seemed the same (all four of them) it is very hard to get in your ear, and then harder to get it to fit and seat well. I previously tried a Plantronics 815 and am now using a Jabra BT8040. The other thing I found was that you could buy this directly from their site cheaper than here, or most other places, to undercut your own dealers is real bad.

"Knowing the wide range of reviews of this product, I ordered it anyway and would return it if it really didn't work out. Here's the summary: I spent much of two days trying every possible combination of signal antenna location: inside, outside, 10 feet high, 20 feet high, near a window, in the attic. I followed the instructions and kept the base unit as far away as possible, with as much vertical separation as possible. I oriented the base station antenna vertically and horizontally. Nothing worked. I called Wi-Ex technical support and their recommendation was to buy the additional directional antenna and aim it at one specific tower. I decided I didn't want to spend more and risk still not having the repeater work, so I returned it instead. Now the detail. I did quite a bit of background work. I live in the middle of a nice flat part of Silicon Valley and there is no lack of towers around. My house is a single-story wood frame; no big buildings around and no hills. There are 3 AT&T cell towers within 0.85 miles (I found them and measured distance). The problem is that I happen to be located almost exactly in between and equidistant from these three towers, and apparently their power is adjusted so that they don't overlap a great deal. In other words, I get three sets of signals, none particularly strong, and depending on specific conditions at any moment in time the strongest signal comes from any of these three towers at random. So the phone is constantly hunting for a signal, and rarely gets one very strong for very long. The YX510 repeater uses an omnidirectional signal antenna, in other words it will see all three towers the same way my phone does -- varying in relative signal strength constantly. It will simply repeat that mixed up signal. Furthermore, the YX510 will ratchet its boost down if it detects a strong signal, which happens every once in a while. So it is easy to see what is happening. The repeater cannot help this situation and in fact makes it worse by occasionally ratcheting boost down when it happens to get a short burst of a strong signal. The end result was that my cell reception was no better with the repeater than without -- not better, just ""different"" -- I was stuck more often in Edge than without, but I did often have 2-3 bars as long as I was in line of sight of the base station and no more than 15 feet away. Beyond that, I lost signal. The solution would appear to be to use a directional antenna and aim it at one tower. This would potentially solve these issues: the phone would not hunt between towers and the YX510 would not get a wildly varying signal strength (I think). However, I'm not ready to make that jump yet and will need to do some more research. I was also not very impressed with the construction or the instructions for the YX510. I will want to look at other options (all of which, BTW, are substantially more expensive, but generally the companies offering them have longer track records). The YX510 with omnidirectional signal antenna is probably a good product when there is a single, dominant cell tower nearby. In my case, with multiple equal-strength towers (but at marginal strength), it did not help at all. Since Wi-Ex tech support knew the problem immediately when I described my situation, it appears they are aware of it -- which IMHO means they should make it clearer what the limitations are. The marketing material and the installation guide are written to promote the idea that you just throw the stuff up and it should work. RF just isn't like that. Thanks to Amazon, returning it was easy.",accessories,negative,negative,0.6000000000000001
