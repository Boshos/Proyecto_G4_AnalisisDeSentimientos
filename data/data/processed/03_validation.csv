"Well, I was so anxious for a bluetooth phone, I bought the Flare. I couldn't beat the price for something with that technology, and the only reason I want bluetooth is for to use wireless headsets at last! For this I deactivate my perfectly good MTV Edition V5 Slider, and after an afternoon of entering my address book on a new phone, I already miss having a Kyocera. Right now, Life's not so Good. Before, with my V5, all I had to do was push the up button for my balance, and the right button to set the phone to vibrate, along with the usual on/off buttons. With the LG Flare, I have to push a menu button, find the ""my account"" button, wait for it to launch a browser, which is scary because I have no intention of paying for web content. Then, once the balance shows, without warning like my Kyocera did, you hit the red phone to get out of it, and the web browser icon remains on the phone. I hate that! You go through just about the same rigmarole to set the phone to vibrate. The owner's manual doesn't even mention vibrate in the index, so I'm better off downloading the PDF from Virgin Mobile's website so that I can keyword search the document! I've managed to turn down the funky ringtone volume (I miss my Kyocera ringtones, too - I don't want rap music on my phone!) Entering text is a headache no matter what phone you have, so re-entering my contact list is once again a chore. I learned my lesson from my first VM phone, though, and I only put the important people in! It's a lot to get used to, and a downside to phones with no SIM card. But I don't need complicated phones! I need 'em to make and take calls, and that's it. So why did I buy it in the first place? As mentioned before, the opportunity for a wireless headset which my beloved Kyoceras don't have. Also, the phone is a handsome little thing! It's about the same size as my slider when closed, but it not as thick. When the clamshell is opened, it gives the impression of being a much bigger phone, which I like. I've set the backlighting to dim, but when an incoming call comes in, a window lights up on the outside of the clamshell where the time is. One thing I did notice is the time it takes to get going when it's been turned on. It says ""HELLO"" in big letters, almost like my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/JVC-XV-N40BK-Progressive-Scan-Slim-DVD-Player-Black/dp/B00008N6X1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">JVC XV-N40BK Progressive-Scan Slim DVD Player (Black)</a>&nbsp;did, and when you turn it off, it says ""BYE"" in big letters that show up on both the inside and the outside screen. It's gimmicky stuff that I think is actually kind of neat. After two days I don't yet know if I'll keep it - almost as soon as I bought this I heard of a new slider phone coming for Virgin Mobile made by Samsung! Maybe one day Kyocera will make a bluetooth slider for Virgin Mobile - BESIDES the Slider Sonic - that doesn't cost too much that I can love. I'll never pay $100 for a phone, whether it's landline or wireless. I loved my cheap little slider - and sliders in general. But, after three phones with Virgin Mobile, first the sturdy K9 Royale, then my trusty V5 slider, this is my first non-Kyocera phone I've had in the four years I've been with Virgin Mobile. Maybe I'll learn to like it more as I live with it. I'm willing to give it a chance in the meantime. I've heard good things about LG, so we'll see. One thing about Virgin Mobile phones - if I don't like it, it won't cost me a two-year contract or an arm and a leg to change it!",neutral

"Blackberry HS-655+ Bluetooth Headset (Black): For the final price of [...] this BT headset is a good value. Pros: Light-weight, fits good in my ear, sound quality is good, although voices sound a little muffled. Cons: Buttons are hard to press, can be charged only in the special case that comes with it, silly blue light that illuminates the main button. I find it very uncomfortable when I have to press and hold the main button to turn the 655+ on or to activate voice dialing because the strength required to operate the button pushes the headset into my ear canal. I am not a fan of headsets that flash silly blue light, while it may not be very noticeable during the day, it is very noticeable in the dark. 655+'s main button with the BB logo flashes blue light when it is on. I prefer Nokia's approach with a very small and discrete light. I see the necessity to use the charging case as another downside of 655+. Unless you have two charging cases or carry one with you all the time, you cannot charge head set at home and in the car. Bottom line. Given all the cons, at five dollars it is a good value, but I'd be disappointed if I paid more.",neutral

"The phone cover is great because it covers not only the phone body, but also the LCD screen (much better than 80% of the other cases that don't protect the screen at all). However, this cover has a major flaw. While the plastic serves its purpose, it is way too thin/brittle and cracks appear only after a few days.",negative
"It isi one good product. It answers my need with the call forwarding feature. It does it amazingly well. The voice quality is great; there is no problem with call dropping. I am quite happy with it. My peers can call me from overseas with the Skypes service. The call is forwarded to my cell. I wish Vosky had worked harder on the feature list. For instance, the pre-entered forwarded phone number can only be changed when you are in front of the computer connected to the Vosky. Why can't that number be changed remotely? When you call a contact, there is only one option is available: call return by pressing 1. Why can't there be more features added to the firmware to handle addional tasks? Bottom line, it is a really good device, worksk seamlessly. The build quality is good though it looks cheapy (the plastic). Forget the manual, very limited...though you don't really need it. Works right out of the box, say...20 minutes! Good luck",neutral

Mines got messed up in less then a week. The mic and sound quality is pretty good but the wires need to be improved.,neutral
"Based on the positive reviews here and elsewhere, especially compared to the Jawbone, I went for this headset as my first foray into Bluetooth. I'll be returning it for one simple reason: The microphone volume is too low and you can't adjust it. Most of my calls are conference calls. If people can't hear me, which they can't with this headset nearly as well as with my wired headset or the phone handset, then it's useless. The sound quality of the speaker itself is great, but that offers little consolation. I spoke to Plantronics support and they recommended the Discovery 925, their new model with ""Audio IQ"", which increases your voice volume, but they said that it doesn't do as well with wind. The guy did admit that my voice volume was lower with that headset as compared to the phone handset. Not sure what's so hard about getting this right....",neutral

"Pros: Small design Cons: WONT STAY IN EAR! Horrible location of multi-purpse button!!! Summary: This is by far the worst bluetooth headset I have purchased. This device will not stay put in your ear for an extended period of time. No matter how you position it, it will slowly slide out. Also, the multi purpose button is in a very bad location. It's located at the very top of the device which is horrible because when you re-position the device, which you will have to do often after it slips out, you WILL touch the button. This often results in accidental hang-ups or redials. I've had this headset for less than a week and I'm already looking for a replacement for it. I wouldn't GIVE this device away. It will be discarded of.",negative
"The case it's a little bulky but it protects my Nexus well. The stand is a little flimsy and does not display in portrait but I can deal with that. The covers for the charging port and the head phone jack is cool. I sometimes take it off when in No danger of dropping it on a hard surface because I love the way the Nexus 4 feels without it, but when I need protection, I put it on. It slips on and off easily and had a good feel to it. Like I said before, it is a little bulky, but it needs to be for good protection. The price was awesome and the shipping was awesome. If you have a Nexus 4, this is the case you need.",positive
The sound quality is fine... as long as you keep your phone no further from the earpiece than your shirt pocket. This thing has NO range to it. It's unfortunate because it has an otherwise solid design. The single rocker switch is slick and intuitive. All the design in the world doesn't mean a lick if it just doesn't work.,negative
"Utterly terrible reception (and I can't emphasize that strongly enough). I get ""no service"" in areas that I'd get four bars when using a phone that's $400 cheaper. I can't even get reception in my home! Owned it for two days, missed about a dozen calls. My guess is that you need to sit on top of a cell tower in order to make a call. Since there's no reception and it's useless as a phone, that makes this a $500+ PDA, which it clearly is not worth despite its pluses. That said, the software freezes and crashes often. Before I returned it to the Sprint store I sat in my car and checked the reception. It said ""No Service."" How Ironic.",negative

I have the RAM mounts in my car, on my motorcycle and on my mountain bike and they never move - ever. They cost about twice what this mount costs but they are definitley worth the price. Check out GPS City or equivalent for ideas. $10 extra is a small price to pay for a $350 unit NOT to fall off your windshied or bike!",neutral
"The product arrived as advertised and after reading many reviews I was all set for a great experience. Initially the product worked out well, good fit, easy to use, decent sound quality. It only took me two weeks to break the first ear loop. I called Aliph and although the girl was nice about sending me a free ear loop, she was adamant that I caused the problem. And mentioned that they sell ear loops on the web site and next time I would have to purchase a replacement. I figured at two weeks per loop life I was going to be spending some dollars on replacements. I was not wrong, the ear loops cannot handle any pressure and snap like a French fried potato. Although they look very sturdy, they break easily where the metal is halved to fit into the Jawbone. My guess is it is a casting issue, but Jawbone does not want to hear about that. I ordered four more loops from the web site and I am already down to having two left. One of the new ones broke after only two hours of use. The second problem I have faced is the charger pulls the back off the Jawbone when removing it after a charge. I have had the Jawbone now for about two months and use it everyday and have used the charger a few times, but certainly not excessively (is that possible for a charger?) so this was an unexpected event. Crazy glued it and now will see how it handles the next after charge separation. Bottom line, if the hardware cannot support the device, it really does not matter how good the electronics might be. As to the electronics/sound quality, reception, pairing..... Sound quality seems good. Pairing is easy although it will not pair with a Treo and another phone. It will pair with two phones if one is not a Treo. Sometimes it will not switch to the second phone after it has been used to answer a call on the other, but most times is switches over ok. I would not recommend this product and will keep searching for a product that delivers good construction, sound quality and reception. Alas, the search goes on, doesn't any body make a decent product?",negative

"After doing extensive research on the best hands free device for my car I purchased the Motorola Roadster Pro. While the look and ease of operation is fine the quality of the voice recognition is poor. I also had several complaints of distorted speech from my callers. The hands free option to place outgoing calls must be synced with your phone but this feature proved a failure. The last irritant i have encountered is with incoming calls to either ""answer"" or ""ignore"". This feature only works sporadically and forces you to use the call answer button directly on the device. Bottom line its an ok device but certainly not great and I wish I had a better option available.",neutral

"Doesn't fit very tightly so it can get caught on things.

I like it and it provides great protection, but I would like it better if it were not rubberized.",neutral
Nt compatible with my service,negative
"Obviously the intuitiveness of the phone is dictated by Windows Mobile Smartphone 2003 - which at best can be described as OK. Feature wise it's right up there and of course it integrates seamlessly with Office via Activesync or over the internet. Which does bring up the issue of configuring it. I bought it for use with T-Mobile and I found it quite difficult to navigate which T-Mobile services I'd need to get all of the functionality on the phone - combined with the fact that since this phone is unsupported by T-Mobile, you'll need to manually configure the email/internet etc. Finally got it all figured and now everything works well. However, using all of the features will consume your battery. Heavy usage of the email and internet features will mean a battery life of about 1 1/2 days. Lighter use, or no use, brought it back up to about 3 days on standby. Sound quality is excellent and construction is above par with one caveat - the screen is made of plastic which is anything by scratch resistant. Advise buying a carry case.",neutral
"I purchased this headset with high expectations. I took my time. I compared and contrasted. I read all the reviews. I thought I had made a great purchase. Unfortunately, the ergonomic design of this headset does not match the electronic design. I can't believe how badly Aliph missed the mark with this headset! First, the good. The sound from this headset rocks! The noise mitigating technology is great. I work in computer data centers the noise level often fluctuates. The set adjusts both the sound heard by the other listener and the volume that I hear. It still has very poor quality in windy environments, but I don't know of a set that doesn't. Now the bad. This headset wouldn't be allowed in Guantanamo Bay. It is pure torture to wear. The various combinations of ear bud and ear loop just gives you more ways to inflict pain on your ears. I can't wear the headset for more than about 10-15 minutes, and sometimes end calls due to the uncomfortable feeling. I used to put the set in my pocket between calls. Problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily. I contacted the company and they indicates that this is because if the loop doesn't break, the headset itself would break instead. The company told me I could ""gently"" bend the loops to fit my ear better. They also recommended Jabra ear gels instead of the Aliph ear buds. They also recommended a place that can make a custom gel earbud (for about $65 + shipping). I asked them if it felt right to them that I paid $130 (Best Buy) for their headset and then have to bend the pieces that come with it and buy a competitor's ear gel just to make it comfortable. They didn't seem to have a problem with it. I finally got around the earloop pain by bending a paper clip around my ear and using that for a loop. I do intend to buy a different ear gel bud because Aliph's just hurts my ear. Also interesting that when I told them I had relieved the loop problem with a custom bent paper clip, they never asked to see it. They don't seem interested in improving the feel of this product on the ear. All said, I would never buy this product again and cannot recommend it for use. The is sound quality not worth the pain.",negative
"This case beats all the rest! I just bought a new iPhone and needed a soft case to protect the phone from dust and scratches. I did not want to spend a bundle but did want quality and functionality. A friend recommended BlueMall products so I searched on Amazon and found this gem. It is very soft and has a drawstring with a push button retainer that keeps my iPhone is the case while it is in my backpack. I have tried many soft cases for my iPhones and iPods and they always fall apart or leave lint in the cracks of my devices, this case does not! The stitching is well done and the material is very similar to the black screen cloths that came with my MacBook Pro. Well worth the money!",positive

"I have been using the Q for about three months, and have been very disappointed with its ability to function as a PDA-replacement. It's not a good product, and Motorola took a lot of shortcuts with the interface. Things that annoy me about the Q: - Number lock. It doesn't automatically turn on the number lock when in a field that would typically have numbers (i.e., fields for telephone numbers, dates, and times). You have to manually switch from letters to numbers on the keyboard. - New numbers. If you want to add a phone number to an existing contact from your call log, you must manually scroll through the list of names, rather than typing in the same (and having the device search your contacts). - Lack of Notes. It doesn't have the Notes program that is standard in MS Outlook and other Windows CE-enabled devices. I use Notes for tracking lists of restaurants, books, and wines so that I have them when I need them. Not so with the Q. - Navigational functions. It's hard to get to the desired program quickly. For example, if you want to get to your e-mail, you have to go through a menu that lists all messaging functions (i.e., text messaging, multiple mailboxes). - And, just to reiterate, the battery and keyboards also have problems. Enough people have covered those issues already, so I won't expound on them. Some might think I'm being nit-picky, but I think these omissions in programming are unforgivable. Given the level of sophistication in PDAs/smartphones these days, you shouldn't have to work this hard to perform basic functions.",negative
"I bought this headset because I had received complaints about my Motorola headset having and echo sound when I spoke. This headset seems to provide a good sound to whomever I am talking to but the sound on my end is rather thin and tinney sounding. The sound for me, on the receiving end, is not as good as the Motorola headset this is replacing which was half the price. I have no problem keeping it in my ear with the standard earpiece and without using the loops provided but it could be more comfortable and I will probably explore using the Jabra Eargels to rectify this. Contrary to one report here you don't have to use a different ear loop to change the side of your head you wish to use the head piece on just remove the ear loop and put into the other side once inserted the loop will turn 180 degrees to the correct position. All in all if I had to do this over again I would probably try a different head set but since I have this one it works and I am getting used to it.",neutral

Definately for 4x6 print its more than enough. MP3 player - it comes with great speaker. MP3 player is very good. just atatch your device to computer and download songs. then play as you wish Video player- take a video clip just like you do in other digital cameras. also download your own clips to it and enjoy. Phone -Look is definately a winner here. No other phone can even come closer to it. Orange color looks great. I gifted this to my wife and she loved it. Keypads are very good. Organization is very good. It feels like you are working on computer when you browse various options in phone. Overall, believe it or not, this is the best product ever made by Sony. I was planning to buy Ipod. But it is not needed now. You can do almost everything with this product. Moreover its so lightweight that you won't believe it. also you can add extra 2 GB card to it if you want more music. I have ordered a classic pearl white case for this phone. Hope to get it soon.

"I've had two of these (one for me, one for the wife) for about two months now, and we both really like the phones. They are slick looking, for one thing, but actually work well in pretty much every aspect as well. Reception has been stellar, no dropped called (even in areas where I know the signal is weak and where our old phones would drop the call). Talking is clear and we haven't experienced any of the echo issues others have mentioned. Basically, for simple phone purposes it has worked flawlessly. It's got a camera, we rarely use this feature. It's a low resolution and we don't have much use for it, but it's gotta be there nowadays. Web functionality is as good as any small, non-PDA type phone. Again, we don't really use this feature much. My biggest surprise, and I'm thrilled with it, is the music player. My old Motorola had a wannabe mp3 player, but it was severely limited. This little phone has a better music then my Creative Zen in some aspects. It's easy to load and organize, and sound is awesome. The only complaint is that the volume is digital and the level between 4 and 5 is to different...one isn't quite loud enough and the other is too loud. All in all, I can't find anything bad to say about this phone, other then short battery life. It really only lasts a couple of hours of use, so that's a little low. Other then that, I'd highly recommend it.",positive
"This product is little thicker than OEM one, so obviously gives a little longer battery life. Mines, I recharge every 3 days (compared to OEM every 2 days).

Maybe this battery's contact points are faulty ? or it discharges a noisy, unstable voltage out?, I don't know.. So I have to keep looking at my cell phone to make sure it's not off.

"I purchased the Jawbone to replace a couple of older Motorola headsets for a Moto phone. I thought the headset might perform better in a noisy environment like being in my moving convertible. It does a better job but only for noise that has a steady pattern, like the lawn mower in Aliph's videos. If you are listening to your radio and a loud song is playing, the Jawbone is only a little better than the others. Other reviewers complain about how it fits the ear and the ""tinny"" sound...all true. What I found is that my phone has a harder time understanding my voice commands with the Jawbone than with the Motorola headset or any other Bluetooth headset for that matter. I might be too fussy, but for 2 times the price of a comparable headset I'd at least like to to perform as well.",negative
"I ordered these from Vibecellar and after charging (4hrs) I couldn't get these to power up. I did however ""reset"" (plug usb in 3 times real fast) and now they work great. Paired with all 4 of my BT devices. Sound is nice, good volume, good voice. The guy at Vibecellar was nice and offered RMA but I really didn't want to wait so for the price I got them at, I was willing to try and fix them, just glad the fix was so easy. I like these so much that I ordered a new pair today at twice the cost as the first pair was re-manufactured. (one for the office) Cons-, would be that when you hang them around your neck there's some scratchy fabric that's annoying, they start to feel heavy after a while and the fit was too tight at first. Well made and very comfortable keeps ears warm in the winter, you can use for audio and video conferencing as well as phone calls and media players <a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Motorola-S805-Bluetooth-2-0-DJ-Style-Stereo-Headphones/dp/B000HDTXDA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Motorola S805 Bluetooth 2.0 (DJ Style) Stereo Headphones</a>",positive
"I have had this unit for 4 months now and overall I am satisfied with it's performance, however there are a few problems that keep me from giving the unit more stars.

"I originally had a Technocel soft leather case for my MotoRazr V3 but wanted extra protection for an old phone that I love so much. This Technocel case arrived through Amazon in timely fashion. It is constructed in 2 plastic halves with a real leather covering. The plastic pieces snap over the original case and fit it very tightly. (Difficult to remove) A negative is that the original leather case had a plastic window to protect the Razr's front viewing window from damage from loose change or keys. This case has no plastic window. I will glue on the inside, a very thin piece of clear plastic which will give me the protection I am looking for. This case is much more heavy duty than the original but the tradeoff is adding 3/16 thickness to the phone which is expected. An advantage to this case is that there is no obstruction to the camera eye when the phone is opened up like my original soft case hinge strap did. The original leather case was too thin and provided very little protection to any side of the phone if dropped. The weakness in this case design is that the top of your phone has very little protection as there is no ""shoulder strap"" to straddle the hinge and give at least some protection to the hinge area if dropped. I bought two of these cases so I have a spare.",positive

"ONLY DOES 1/2 OF WHAT I BOUGHT IT FOR!! These BLUETOOTH headphones can technically be used as BOTH a headset for a mobile phone AND headphones for MP3 at the same time. Technically you can use it to source audio from two seperate devices, one for mp3 plus your phone for talk. But my phone the moto V3t has MP3. So i figured I would be able to talk and also listen to MP3 with these using my V3t phone. But NO DICE. According to moto, ONLY the moto Q has the ability to play the MP3 over the bluetooth. For the v3t and others you need a wired headset. If that doesnt make any sense to you join the club, it makes NO sense to me either. But I have to live it it or buy a moto Q. My other complaints... the earpads fell off straight out of the package. Moto wanted me to PAY to sent them in for warranty. If you twise them on, and PUSH REALLY HARD they seem to lock in better. But who knows how long until I lose them. Would i buy again, YES, but would have rather known about the features.",neutral

"Pros: Small size. Can be mounted either via screws, double sided tape, or Velcro. Is fused via ATM fuse. The 12V adapters can handle a few Amps, but I wouldn't try 10+Amps. USB ports work fine. Cons: USB section seems to have a lot of RF leakage, so much so that it interfered with the radio in the car. Tried 2 different stereo's in this car, upgraded the antenna and double grounded everything, but it still interfered with the tuners. I tried surrounding the charger with metal to act as a shield, but had only limited success. So until I can find a replacement, I've stop using the USB ports. The 12V ports seem to work without generating interference.",neutral
"I've been using a silver RAZR for 2 months and here are my conclusions: THE BAD: - BROKE!! After 1 month it stopped operating - the screen turned on but I had no access to my data nor could I make any use of the phone to receive or make calls. So despite the positive aspects mentioned below, I cannot rate it any better. Goes to show that quality control isn't Motorola's strong point. - Short battery life. Phone starts to beep after 2-3 hrs of talking. - Calendar, alarm, notes, contacts cannot be synchronized with Outlook. - Awful camera resolution. Plus, the camera doesn't take video. - No MP3 player. THE GOOD: - Free! (or at least very cheap if you don't buy with a plan). - Decent reception. - Universal system - you can travel with it anywhere (you might need to pre-authorize this with your operator). - Can be charged with a USB cable. - Slick, slim, cool look. - Bluetooth range.",negative

"The RAZR is a stylish phone, and the price seems right, and most of the features are okay. Bluetooth was a biggie for me, and this phone seems to perform fine. There is, however, one MAJOR flaw - which is not documented anywhere. The capacity for SMS messages is fixed - it is not calculated from the memory of the machine (which at 5 megs should be plenty) - rather, it is hardwired. My phone maxes out at 30 SMS messages. That's it. You have to start deleting after that. I had to call Motorola and speak with an engineer to learn about this ""feature"". So, if text messaging is important to you (and is the major reasoning behind my getting a new phone), be aware of this limitation.",neutral

"This mobile phone replaced a Nokia 6270 I bought approximately 6 months ago (I have reviewed that phone on Amazon also - please read the review if you are considering purchasing that phone). Here are the highlights of the 3125: Pros: (1) Design is excellent - The phone is thin enough to easily fit in pants pockets without being obtrusive or feeling heavy. Buttons located on the exterior of the unit require sufficient force so that they aren't accidentally activated while handling the phone. While the exterior is low profile and slim, it is also textured with small ridges in strategic touchpoints (sides, back battery plate, etc) that enhance your grip. Nice touch. (2) Screen - Very clear; graphics quality is excellent. I have not used the browser function yet, but it appears the screen resolution would provide a decent experience. (3) Keypad - Well designed despite the lack of independent buttons. I'll have to admit, the 'sheet metal' implementation of buttons on the RAZR is what turned me off. It felt like buttons would be accidentally pressed and the design would not wear well, but the Cingular 3125 seems to have struck the right balance. Keys are easy to use and have good feedback. (4) Menu system - Straightforward for a Windows-based phone with such a variety of features. It is never easy to pack that many features onto a menu structure that fits intuitively on the screen of a cell phone, but they've done a respectable job of it. My biggest hurdle was pairing a Jabra headset; I didn't get that a 'menu' function on the bottom of that feature would reveal Bluetooth pairing options, but it added a whole layer of new functionality. Seemed a bit unituitive, but maybe I was just didn't get the paradigm in my first couple tries. (5) Reception - Comparable to other Cingular phones I've used; seems to be effected by the same weak spots. (6) Battery life - A pleasant surprise! I talk a lot on my cell and two hours of calls had little effect on the battery (down by 1 bar). My Nokia would have been nearly drained. (7) Contact synchronization - I use a Mac, so this is more involved than it would have been if you are a Windows user. Still, I downloaded a synchronization package from the internet (The Missing Sync) and it worked very nicely. Contacts and appointments worked very well. (8) Headset - I bought a Jabra BT headset to work with this unit; it worked very well. The only issue is that the headset begins to experiencing skipping and choppiness if the phone and headset are out of line of site. For example, if the phone is in your pocket. (9) Responsiveness - I've owned PDAs and Smartphones before and I was always displeased with responsiveness of the interface. This appears to respond well. It lagged a few times, but it is tolerable. Cons: (1) Needs more themes out of the box. I don't use MSN, though that is the most attactive theme that comes with the phone. The Cingular theme is functional and looks decent, but you could reasonably expect something a little flashier considering that they got everything else right with this phone. (2) This is reaching a bit, but it comes with a 128MB SD chip. Considering the multi-media functionality, this is grossly insufficient. I'm a bit of a purist, prefering a separate, higher quality camera rather than one integrated with my phone, but I realize an integrated camera+phone is attractive to a lot of people. Between photos and music, you'll eat up 128MB before you know what's happened. (3) Ring volume is a bit low. Out-of-the-box, the ring volume is a bit difficult to hear if you are in even a moderately noisy environment. I have not yet found a way to increase ring volume. (4) Difficult to see missed call indicator on external display. The dark external display with the blue clock is undoubtedly a cool feature of this phone, but as soon as the backlight times out, you have to activate the light to see a missed call. Not a big deal, but a bit annoying if you are used glancing at an external display to identify missed calls. Definitely not a show stopper. Notable: (1) As I pointed out, I use Macs, not Windows, so Windows Media is useless for me. If you manage your songs and photos in Windows, I suspect the built-in Windows Media functionality would be a big plus for you. (2) Outlook integration looks very nice. This phone is going to be great if you use Outlook and your e-mail is hosted on Exchange. I'm a bit jealous. Why not 5 stars? If it interfaced with a Mac out of the box, I would recommend it without hesitation. I totally understand the target market of the phone is a Windows-enabled corporate workforce and in that area they completely make the grade. Still, this is a review, right? It is all about perspective! Not to worry, third-party software fills this gap!",positive

"First of all, let me make it known that I used this headset with a Bluetooth enabled laptop computer rather than with a Bluetooth enabled mobile phone. That being said, I bought this headset on the advice of one of Best Buy's ""geeks"" that roam their store who assured me that it would work great as a computer headset as well. Setting up the headset to work with a computer was easy once I read the directions. I had no problem with the configuration of this product or getting it to respond to my Bluetooth enabled laptop (read the easy to follow directions). My complaint was with the volume levels. Both the headphones and microphone volume were only marginal. I looked everywhere in the Bluetooth configuration menus on my laptop to adjust the volume for both the headphone and microphone volume adjustment, but they were not to be found. As a result, people could only barely hear me and I could hear them only in a more quieter environment. I sent a request for help to the Motorola support web site, and got back what appeared to be an outsource to a third world reply of ""Response:"" followed by the same list of three URLs that I had previously been shown by their ""knowledgebase"". At that, I put all of the parts back into the package that it came with and took it back for a full refund. Again, this review should only be used by someone who is thinking about using this headset with a computer instead of a Bluetooth enabled mobile phone. I did not try it with a mobile phone, so it may work perfectly well with one. All I am saying is that if you're looking for a Bluetooth headset to use with a computer, then this is probably not your best choice.",negative

"CONS: I have been in circles with T-mobile over this phone since January. I am on my FOURTH Nokia 6133 since January and have had similar problems with all the phones. The phone has problems with reception and that causes an echo-y, Darth Vader, Chipmunk, Windtunnel sound for both caller and call receiver. I have been told everything by T-mobile that it is my account, the tower, the phone, the antenna, but all I know is that every 6th phone call will result in TERRIBLE sound quality. I have also experienced an occasional problem with both text and picture messages locking up the phone (which is a known error in the phone) The camera button goes off all the time. Speakerphone is almost useless. Battery life is not as good as advertised. I need to recharge everyday. PROS: Love the button to press to flip the phone. Phone layout is great. Good little camera Like the built in-radio (Sorry I don't have very helpful pros) 2 stars for style and features, -3 for whatever is causing all the audio issues. P.S. I have used a loner phone between NOKIA 6133's and they worked fine, so it is not my coverage area...",negative

"Finally I switched to my cell phone carrier and joined the tempting big black Razor family, and I began to search for a Bluetooth headset even before I had the phone. It sounds silly but it is true - I wanted to have a match. My final selection ended with the black and Motorola branded Bluetooth headset, and of course, the highest model available, 850. So I'd like you to think of my experience before you add more to your credit card bill, and ask yourself, ""Do I really HAVE to have this Motorola 850 headset?"" However, it was like an online date, I wanted to like it, but it's just not for me. I have smaller and softer ears, and I have long hair and the worst, I wear eye glasses. These factors make it so hard for me to keep that thing stable on my ear. I always feel like it's going to fall off, and that is not a good feeling. I realized that a headset with ear plug would fit better for me. It took me a while to get used to it. I missed calls either by pressing it too many times, or I didn't realize that I could only get basic ringers because ring tones are not support via Bluetooth connection. It's not too bad to use it while I am driving except for the wired hanging feeling. If the phone's Bluetooth is on, connecting and calling is easy. But other cheaper pieces can do the same. The piece is very light and small. After having it for a week, I lost it because I refused to wear it all the time, and it's hard to store it anywhere - you have keys, ID, wallet, cell phone, PDA, iPod ... I'd advise you to get something cheaper. A discounted $69 for a Bluetooth headset is too much. When you look at that product, it feels cheap. Well, we always pay more for something new. My friend gave me the free headset that came with his cell phone, offered by Amazon.com, the Body Glove BlueVoice Bluetooth Headset ($29 without buying the phone). It's actually better than Motorola 850 for me although it got bad reviews. Heads up: I bought this piece from an Amazon.com vendor (via buy new or used link). It was little bit cheaper; however, it doesn't seem it was made for the US market. I compared it with the one in store and they have different packaging. The one I have came with a charger that won't fit the power outlet, but it also came with an adapter to fit it. Why? And the material inside is printed in English and Chinese. The product quality may be the same, but I am wondering if Motorola will honor the warranty - that is a big question.",neutral

I don't know why the people for whom it doesn't work get so upset. It like trying on a shirt and it doesn't fit, big deal.

"I bought this to use with my Zen Vision M Mp3 player as they are supposed to be compatible with each other. The Zen fits extremely snugly into the holder. So snug that I tore a little bit of the fabric trying to get it in the first time. So beware and be careful putting in your Zen and taking it out of this armband. It fits, but barely. (And contrary to another review i have a vertical earphone jack and it fits with this fine. The face of the Zen is obscured by the thick fabric that covers the armband. So once you have it in the armband and put it on your arm, you're pretty much stuck with whatever's playing. Forget adjusting the volume too. This limitation is quite inconvenient if you ever want to change what's playing or have to adjust the volume for external factors, but if you only want to set it on random or a specific playlist and go this limitation shouldn't matter too much. The fit is good. It stayed on my arm while working outside no problem. There is a velcro strip on the outside that might interfere with your clothes depending on what fabric you're wearing, but I haven't found it to be an issue for me. T shirts don't stick I guess. This wasn't designed as well as it could, but it basically serves the purpose it was made for.",neutral

Naturally, they won't sell me the replacement part-- they want me to buy a new phone. So I will wait until it develops other problems, which seems likely at this point, before I file my claim. Otherwise I like the phone. I just don't expect it to last very long.",negative

"I am a Nokia user ever since I started using mobile phones and I also have Nokia N800. After in hyper excitement mode ordering Nokia N95, I am quite disappointed. 1) The browsing in N95 is not quite friendly at all. 2) It doesn't 'just works' So many user tweaks needed on the phone to use its functionalities. 3) After using a iPod Touch and seeing a iPhone, iPhone trumps N95 on ease of use, looks, screen. While N95 is the king in specifications and features, for me I think I would go with iphone as ease of use is one of my main reason. 4) For Techies can put so much into technical settings and installing and finding various applications and N95 is the best choice! (I learnt a bad lesson by buying Nokia N800 which is not 'General User Friendly' at all compared to IPod Touch. I am not a apple fanboy but after using both Apple Products and Nokia Products, I feel that If I go with Apple I will always have stuff that 'just works' and so intuitive and friendly to use! I am returning the same and will be going for a iphone! Update : 3 days after N95 8GB 1) I am feeling that my right side slider has become bit loose. The left side remains perfect while the right one becomes wobbly. 2) An annoying bug in which memory card has to be reformatted as my video recording pauses every 10-15 seconds and continues again. Not able to get continuous recording. For a 640$ device (which say in mobiles is a very significant investment) these bugs are really annoying and completely unsatisfactory. Update : One week after N95 Hmm tough one.. There are some items which takes time to get used to it.. kind of 'acquired taste'. I would put N95 into that category. Though it may not 'wow' me like iPhone whenever I touch the phone, the versatility is amazing. The kind of apps available and freedom to used bluetooth keyboard, easy tethering with N800,nice applications to use makes this device a swiss army knife. I have decided to keep it with me albeit tolerating some minor annoyances (""acquired taste"" / ""undocumented 'features' "" ). **** Update 2 weeks later! I am liking the phone! Like the feel when pressing the keys! Got used to the phone... Things going pretty smooth. Installed lots of applications without much trouble. Camera quality is pretty good for a mobile phone camera. Volume from music player is great. Though Video player (real player) doesnt support too many formats. Need thirdparty applications. **** 2 Months Later ***** The Gallery is slow!! Believe me it takes atleast 45 seconds to 2 minutes to load the gallery after you have taken a picture to see a thumbnail of the picture if you have even a modest number say 75 pictures totally!! Completely unacceptable in a 600$ gadget! When I have to show my pictures to someone its like taking whole age just to get a thumbnail while everyone just open their stuff to show the pic! Sometimes the phone becomes sluggish and needs restart couple of times a week... There are a lot of nice applications and one can choose as per their needs... The s60 browser sucks a bit and I would recommend opera mini over s60 browser any day! Overall I am still having some positive view over the phone but the gallery load time alone will make me to think twice before buying the phone again...as I got this as mainly for my mobile camera usage and i cant even see the pictures in my mobile easily without waiting for 2 mintues or so.... There are no other phones with similar tech specifications in terms of hardware... but if i have to go over the process again... i may go with iphone 3g for the ease of use and the usablity unless nokia fixes these issues my next purchase wouldnt be a nokia device! 5 Months Later... The phone is utterly annoying... and unbelievably slow.... just load 50 odd photos and it takes for ever to open the gallery... frequent reboots.... slow hang-ups... I have wasted my money.... I am giving this phone to my dad.. I just want to get rid of this phone....",neutral

"I wanted a headset to use with my new Samsun i730 Pocket PC phone (way cool), as well as, use with my 5.8GHz cordless home phone via a Jabra A210 bluetooth adapter, and this hit the mark. This was the only headset I found to synchronize with TWO devices, so I paired it easily with the i730, then the Jabra A210 adapter, and whola, whichever rings if I am close to both, I can answer either line with just one headset. I bought and test the Jabra BT250V and BT800, the 250V sounded good and was pretty comfortable, but could NOT sync with TWO devices at the same time, and the BT800 was cool, but it was not secure on my ear and let in too much outside noise. The Plantronics 510 sounds the best of them all, and it is extremely comfortable, I had it on for 3 hours one day and it was still fine. I love the configuration of the small boom with the behind the ear battery, great design. The battery life has been great as well, I have been getting 4+ hours of straight talk time and several days of standby. The AC charger is pretty small as well, nice for travel. Also, this headset had the least amount of static from what I would assume to be the bluetooth connection (actually, there is NO static most of the time), while both the Jabra ones had a bit of static, the BT800 being the better of the two Jabra headsets for me. Oh, and I got this thing for $50 on amazon... what a deal, I cannot believe what terrific sounds and functionality at this price! Gripes: I hate to say there are any gripes because I really like this headset, but we are hear for full disclosure and helping eachother with thorough reviews, so here they are... I did like the vibrate option of the Jabra devices, which this does not have. Also, not sure if it is just my device, but the power button is not very tactile, which means, when I press it, it does not feel like it moves and I cannot feel any detent, but I have been able to use the button without much issue. Needless to say I love this headset and put this as my first choice if anyone asks for my recommendation. Cheers!!!!",positive

That model had a recessed jack to plug in the headphones and would not accept a standard plug, like the newer iPhones do. Since I am now using the 3rd gen. iPhone, my 1st two are jailbroken to use as iPod Touches, for music, internet and app use. This jack comes in handy when connecting headphones, as the 1st gen. iPhone has a sub-par speaker, and is of little use in listening to music.

"I ordered this a few weeks ago and was really excited about receiving it. Coincidentally the day before my N95-4 arrived, Nokia released a new firmware update so the first thing I did was update the software on my N95-4 to the latest version. During the update process I noticed the USB port on the phone itself seemed loose but thought nothing of it. After the update was done I began to use the phone and I ended up returning it to Amazon the next day! You've seen all the positive reviews, so I won't rehash that, but here are why I returned it: - The USB port on my N95-4 was extremely loose or broken. You had to apply a lot of pressure and push the cable in and then not touch it for it to stay connected. It was so loose that a breeze from the window could disconnect the device from the PC. I tried several USB cables, computers/ports with no success. - The USB transfer speed is HORRIFIC for a device that comes with 8GB. It took almost 2.5 hours to transfer about 4GB of music to the device using Windows Media Player. Using mass storage mode is just as slow since this uses USB 2.0 Full-Speed (old spec) not USB 2.0 High-Speed (common today). No matter what people tell you this is absolutely frustrating and annoying over time, even if you don't transfer stuff much. - The slider on the phone is wobbly and whenever I pressed a button on the keypad it made a creaking sound that I don't expect from a $600 phone. It did not feel solid at all, at least not my N95-4 - The overall size of the device is surprisingly small but the thing is as thick as a brick which makes it awkward to carry in your pant pocket or worse jeans pocket. - Even without really installing any apps on it the thing would randomly slow down and not respond to key presses and then just ""wake up"" all of a sudden it was bizarre. - Does not charge via USB. Not used to this so was annoying that you have to at times have both a USB cable and Nokia charger plugged in. I ended up getting a Nokia N78 (US 3G) that was just recently released and I'm extremely happy with it. It addresses most if not all of the issues I had with the N95-4 including fastest USB, fast CPU/responsive, excellent build quality. I would recommend looking at the N78 or the upcoming N96 (successor to N95) over the N95-4.",neutral

A friend had this bluetooth headset and reccomended it. But my friend is much bigger than I am.

I've also had some issues with it just disconnecting from my phone while I'm talking on it. The clarity is great and the headset seems to be made well.,neutral
"Definitely a solid bluetooth headset for the price. Fits comfortably around the ear and the ear piece isn't an issue.

Also, the individual on the receiving end would always complain that I sound like I'm talking several feet away from the phone. However, this issue wasn't a problem while I was in my car where sound quality and voice quality were excellent. I would definitely recommend this for anyone that needs a cheap headset for use while driving. For those that need a headset for their office exclusively, I wouldn't suggest this headset.",positive

"This is a great phone, if your primary use is email; If you really need voice service, and only occasional email, consider the Audiovox SMT5600 instead. Regardless, I hope you have more luck with Cingular than I did. There's simply not enough time or room to recout my problems with Cingular but I'll provide a brief recap. I have service with Cingular and with AT&T. The problems began when I tried to merge my two services into one account (Cingular did acquire AT&T, right?), upgrade my service plan, and upgrade the AT&T phone. Simple enough, right? Wrong. After (literally) four visits to the store, 10+ phone calls (and speaking with over 30+ people), and completing several forms on the web I thought I had finally solved the problem and everything was fine. THEN my phone showed up ... it was the wrong one. Attempts to get the problems resolved on the phone failed (we can't do that here), attempts to return it to the store failed (that was sent to you by our phone sales group, you can't return it here), and a final desperate attempt to resolve it through Cingular's Office of the CEO was meet by ""you shouldn't have tried to transfer your service from AT&T to Cingular"" (i.e. it's your fault) and ""you're trying to order the most expensive phone we have, what do you expect us to do, give you a free one?"" (i.e. you're trying to cheat us). My experiences can basically be catagorized in the following fashion: * You're an AT&T customer, you'll need to call Cingular for that. * You're a Cingular customer, you'll need to call AT&T for that. * You're a corporate customer, we're the retail group. You'll need to call business services for that. * You did that over the phone, you'll need to take up that problem with telesales. * You did that in the store, you'll need to take up that problem with them. * That can't be done over the web. * I don't know how to do that. I think the crowning touch however, was the retail store that refused to sell me the phone because my account is tagged as a ""sponsored"" account that gets an equipment discount. The manager wanted to sell it to someone who would pay full price! Good luck! ...msg",negative

"I've purchased two of these phones over the years. It's been several years since I bought this one for my daughter. Personally I prefer the clamshell type of phone, but my daughter has moved on to the smartphones. Anyway, at the time these were first put out, they were amazing phones. Very sleek, very useful, tons of features. The only really annoying trait of all of the Moto Razr phones is that the glass is horribly thin and flimsy, and is very easy to break (both inner and outer glass). Good luck finding replacement glass for it - and when you do, expect to pay $15 bucks for it. When you replace the glass, if you don't position it just right, it's easy to break again, because it will be possible to put too much pressure on it. It's not possible to remove it and reposition it, because the glue is so sticky and the glass so thin, that you'll break it just getting it off again. These days you can buy a flip phone with more features for $30 bucks. Yes, I still prefer flip phones. They call them ""throw back"" phones now. Funny, I just call them a good buy :) But not this one, not any more. Skip this and get something newer.",neutral

"This phone is one of the better phones out there for the money. It does have some small quirks. My main one is.... For a company that says its not evil, NET10 should not have disabled parts of the phone, the USB storage capability. One of the reasons I went pre-paid is because I was tired of companies disabling parts of their phone to get you to go through them for everything. Secondly, once in a while the light on the front cover will not notify you of all messages. But I don't mind flipping the phone open from time to time. All the same the reception is good and the net10 service has been acceptable for the price. I don't regret my purchase. But I am seriously put off by the idea of disabling my ability, to get my own ringers on the phone... Net10 mostly not evil.",neutral
"At first I was real excited about this product. Over time, it seems to have a hard time detecting my Blackberry. I would have hoped that every time I got in the car, it would link up to the phone and when I left the car it would disconnect after being a certain distance away. Maybe I am expecting too much. The other thing that bothers me is the the column seems to change even during a phone call. The output volume seems to drop as much as 50%. Not sure if it is Blueant's fault but since the phone volume never drops when I am not using the Blueant, I have to assume the Supertooth 3 is the problem. It is very inconsistent for me.",neutral

"All 3 of these accessories work wonderfully with this phone. At first when I saw the headseat, I was afraid that it was not going to plug in, but it did with no problem. Also, I can hear the person on the other end very well with the headset. The reception is very clear. It sounds way better than my dad's bluetooth. It's also good if you want to use the radio on the phone, because you need the headset to do so. The carrying case is a steal. You would not be able to get this at a Cingular store for this price. I had already bought a different type holster from the Cingular store, which cost $19.99, and it was no where as good as the one that comes with this set. I haven't tried the car charger yet, but I've already gotten my money's worth. This is a very smart purchase if you have the Nokia 6102 like I do.",positive

It worked well the first week, but after the second charge it started making a popping noise and cutting in and out during calls.

Likes: - Comfortable and light. - In ear design which makes calls in noisy places possible. - Long battery life.

"The flimsy plastic rod used to hold this case to the phone broke instantly on the first try of putting it on the phone, and no force was used... it just fell off. Also, the alignment of the opening for charging the phone is too deep for charging without removing the case, in my opinion. We threw it away, since it wasn't worth the shipping cost to return it. I know it was really cheap in the first place, but I wouldn't waste the original shipping charge on this product.",negative
"The sound on this BlueAnt is fantastic and everyone tells me how great my phone sounds now. The only reason I don't rate this 5 stars is that the piece that fits in my ear is too big to fit into my ear (and I have big ears). This makes it easy to loose and I have to hold it in place during a conversation to make it work right (so much for hands free), I would prefer the plantronics style in-ear piece. Also, the button that turns it on always turns it on in my pocket when not using it (quick push to turn it on but push and hold to turn it off). One last thing that bugs me, I have had several others and the push button to make a call or hang up on this thing toggles the 'voice isolation normal/max' modes (very annoying).",neutral

"I brought it last year because I don't want to carry an mp3 player and a phone at the same time. I was extremely disappointed that when I brought the phone that it does not include itunes and it turns out that there are 2 different versions of v3i- one with itunes installed and another with DAP (motorola's digital audio player.) I ended upgrading the phone with a firmware which allows you to have both itunes, with 100 song limit and DAP, (just google dmatt). I got lucky and it comes with a 256mb card, but I upgraded to a FAR 512mb microsd card. By all means, this does not replace an ipod or anything like that but I am not picky about mp3 players. The itunes that it comes with is simple at best, and it does not support some mp3 formats and I had to reencode them to make it work. Pro's Looks the same as the razr v3 Allows you to sync with your outlook contacts and calendar bluetooth support Call quality is pretty good Mp3 with Itunes (not as good as ipod though) Cons: No EDGE support Sometimes you have to reboot the razr because it does not read the memory card Transfer from pc to phone is slow.",neutral
"The package of 5 batteries is a must if you have multiple watches. In any store they will charge you a flat price an install it for free and some places add a small charge for replacing the battery.

"The sales transaction was smooth and effortless. Thanks! But the problems were with the manufacturing of the case. First the case's snap-on plastic covering didn't snap together with all of the latches catching. Two of the latches were not coming together--no matter how hard I pressed them together. I was afraid I might crush the iPhone internals if I continued. Second the rubber outer covering didn't fit properly into the plastic covering's side holes. One side was fine, the other side awkwardly and crookedly fit into the side hole, deforming the rubber casing. I returned the product to the manufacturer (at my expense) and they're sending me a replacement. Hopefully this was an isolated manufacturing flaw and the next one will be fine. I'll update this review once the replacement unit has arrived.",neutral

The phone does look very delicate at times and would not be an ideal phone for people who are prone to rough handling of phones. The keypad is very big and helps in easy text messaging. I like the small display window outside which gives a minituarized look of whats on your screen. I bought the black Razr and it just looks very nice. The screen does get greasy when ya touch it, so the screen would be better protected in its original plastic covering. All in all a good phone for people who want to make a style statement.",positive

It syncs up to MS Outlook like a charm so all of my contacts, appts, tasks, and emails are always up to date. It comes with bluetooth and works great with my logitech headset. It also has wifi which has been flawless with my wireless network and is very speedy. The screen is absolutely gorgeous. The camera takes decent pictures and video. One of the best features is the battery life. For all it does it lasts an incredibly long time. I have not found a smartphone that even comes close to these features especially for the price.

"...three major flaws in my book: it has a tinny sound that is difficult to hear in a noisy environment, an ear bud that is uncomfortable, and only one size of ear hook that is too big for my ears. I'm not a petite or small person, but the earpiece won't stay on well, no matter how many ways I've adjusted it. Contacting the company to ask for a smaller ear hook resulted in a ""we're sorry, but we don't have one"" message. To their credit, they did reply promptly, but weren't of any help. I've seen this complaint from other people. Pros: The lanyard and clip are nice, the size and weight are small, and the chargers are awesome. Nevertheless, I will be returning this product and finding a more comfortable unit, even if it doesn't have as many ""features"".",neutral
"I bought this earpiece a month ago to go with my brand new Nextel i870. It worked sorta ok but was a bit finiky when used with my phone in my belt holder. I didn't wear it all the time, just when I was commuting to and from work. I kept it in my pocket so it would be on standby, in contact with my phone. Most times, it would connect quickly and function well. Ocassionally, it would seem to connect, but when I attempted an outgoing call, it would disconnect. I also had trouble hearing the unit while driving. As I am approaching my mid 50's, my hearing is not as acute as in past years, and the internal noise from the pickup truck (windows up, and AC running) makes hearing the other party on the earpiece difficult. My main problem with this unit is the recharge plug. I have 3 Nextel/Motorola phones that use this type of plug and have not had any trouble with it. The plug end has a release button to depress when unplugging. The catch on my HS850 charger plug was more difficult to release and required much more pressure to release than my other 2 Motorola charger plugs of the same type. This contributed to undue stress on the socket and eventually the socket pulled loose. I probably charged it 6-7 times over the month I had it. I intend to replace my HS850 with some other type that has an earpiece that fits in my ear, providing some sound isolation from environmental noises, rather than the lay on this ear type. Be careful unplugging this unit from its charging plug.",neutral

"The speaker has pretty decent sound for its size. It supports wired (via 1/8"" TRS cable, included) or bluetooth operation. (The iPhone 3.0 OS update includes the A2DP profile for all iPhones. I've tested it with an older model iPhone, and it works perfectly well.) The speaker has a bass boost feature which I've never been compelled to use -- the bass sounds fine without it, and, to my ears, gets a bit muddy and boomy with it on. The speaker seems pretty well constructed. I have two complaints about this speaker. First, it has a very quick auto-shutoff feature. This is enabled even when the speaker is used fully wired -- plugged in to an A/C socket and receiving the audio signal by cable. This is undocumented by the company, and there's no way to bypass it. The upshot is that if you use it with your computer, it does not behave like a regular speaker. Occasional sounds -- an incoming message, an application notifying you of anything -- are never heard. Instead, the speaker just pops as it comes on, and then moments later, shuts off again. My other complaint is that, often, when used with bluetooth, the sound crackles intermittently. It doesn't matter if I have the speaker 3 inches away from my computer's bluetooth antenna, or several feet away, the crackling is the same. I've not been able to find a fix for this. Keeping the speaker is a difficult decision to make. When it works, it's lovely. But the two annoyances I mention can be terribly aggravating.",neutral
"I bought this phone even though the reviews told me not to, because I loved my old RAZR so much and didn't have time to shop for something else that worked for me. It works ok - it definitely arrived in new condition in a Motorola box, but the charger that came with it didn't have the appropriate connection to work with the phone (awkward). Because it's an unlocked phone in which I am using an older SIM card, I also receive an error message text every morning. Could be worse, but could be better.",negative
"Pairing this device to both a Treo 750 and AT&T 8525 was easy enough. However, even though the manual says that that the device will pair with up to 5 phones, switching between them didn't quite work. For example, after BlueAnt successfully works with the Treo, I would turn off both the BlueAnt and Treo's bluetooth. After that I would enable 8525's bluetooth and then turn on BlueAnt. The 8525 takes a long time before it'll connect with BlueAnt (keep in mind I already went thru the pairing setup process for both phones). The same can be said about the Treo if I do the reverse (make sure 8525 works first, and then try to connect with Treo). BlueAnt's connection is almost instantenously if you only connect with the same phone as the previous connection. This is not a big issue since the wife and I don't switch cars that often. However the straw that broke the camel's back is that the microphone shaft refused to remain in the off (retracted) position after 1 day worth of use. It seemed that there is at least 1 more report of this from previous Amazon reviews (about 2 weeks ago). The microphone shaft is the reason I bought this product. I hate having to press a button for 3 to 4 seconds in order to turn other bluetooth device on/off. It's ironic the feature that sold me the product is the main reason I am returning this and getting a refund.",negative

Also the silicone ring around the part that goes in your ear pops off all the time, and without it, I can't even use it. I have tried. Fortunately I found the darned thing each time so far. It's a little round ring, almost the size as a Cheerio, only about half as thick. Save yourself the misery and buy something better!",negative

"I ordered this phone in spite of reading another review that stated this phone is not unlocked and doesn't work in Italy. When I first opened the package, my heart sank as I thought that my faith in Amazon had been ill-placed. The phone had a ""Cingular"" logo on the front and was an obviously reconditioned unit with one small blemish on the side. When I turned it on, I saw the Cingular logo and thought ""uh oh, locked phone!!"" The story has a happy ending however... In Italy, I bought a Telecom Italia (Tim) SIM card, placed it in the phone, and began using it with no problems. As I type this review, I am sitting in Umbria with the phone at my side. Definitely a very economical way to call home and call within Italy...10 cents per min or so within Italy to other mobiles, and about 60 cents to call the USA. This is a very basic phone, and many of the menus have leftover Cingular features which don't apply (for example, their now-defunct MEDIA NET). However, the phone is a nice size, makes calls, receives calls, easy to adjust the ringer. Comes with a manual, charger etc. A plus is that this phone uses the same mini usb charger as my Blackberry Curve 8310 so I can just carry one charger abroad! I would recommend this phone for travel/vacation use. For constant use, you might want a phone with more features and less Cingular-legacy branding. Hope this helps! Ciao!",neutral
"Ordered this 'charging kit' for my Tungsten E2 through BargainCell, as I have purchased from them in the past, and up until this, didn't have a problem with them. Found that this 'charging kit' WILL NOT charge a Tungsten E2! Back and forth e-mails to BargainCell, two long distance telephone calls, about an hour on the telephone, with them telling me that this 'charging kit' is compatible with both Tungsten and Treo models. Well is 'not'... The cable will initiate a 'sync' when the button is pressed, but it will not charge the E2. Tested it myself, compared it to an original Palm cable and noticed that the cable from BargainCell has about half the number of pins in the connector base to connect to the Palm. No doubt missing the ones that provide the 'charging'! Kind-of makes the USB car adapter and the wall adapter like totally 'useless', unless someone wants to try and sync their palm to their car, or home! Looking around the Internet I see many similar products, all claiming to be compatible with both the Tungsten and the Treo. After this experience, with BargainCell still claiming that these cables are compatible with both models, now I have to question 'all' other such listings, making the same claim! Paying nearly as much for shipping as the item itself, BargainCell expected me to send this back for a refund! No doubt not refunding 'my' shipping expenses back to them, and deducting the shipping expenses I already paid to have this sent to me! Needless to say, a loosing proposition either way to me. Either go through all that trouble and expense for what would be a 'couple dollar' refund, or keep the USB auto and wall charger and toss the cable in the garbage. With numerous other listing all making the same claim as to 'compatibility', I think I'll save my time and aggravation and just spend the $20.00 and get an original from Palm! Had similar experiences with other 'so-called' compatible imported products, dumped on the market cheaply. No more for me! I'll spend the extra and get original OEM products, and probably in the long run, actually save money, not having to deal with time lost on e-mails and telephone calls, after incompatibly issues are discovered, and companies not bothering to do proper research! And what really gets me, is with something so 'simple'! BargainCell is most likely just a reseller of imported goods, taking the word of the importer as 'gospel', and not listening to a customer when they are called telling them that 'Hey... this doesn't work'! Don't know what 'value' others put on their time, but this experience probably wound up costing me more than double the cost of an OEM product! Was this really a 'Bargain'?",negative

"I owned an LG VX6100 before this one and was happy with it. I've had this new 8700 for about a week, and I'm probably going to return it. I'm thinking of going with an LG VX5300. This phone isn't for me. I want phones that conform to the shape of my hand. This phone does just the opposite. My only complaint is really the overall design of the phone. The metallic shell is beautiful, but it's a bit prone to smudges. The external screen is extremely difficult to see in the sunlight and I can barely check the time. Its SD card slot is located behind the battery, so that's a huge pain to handle. Also, this keypad is horrible. Obviously, it was designed so the phone could be thin. I can barely text message without pressing wrong keys and making mistakes. On a lighter side, the phone has a tremendous amount of features like bluetooth, USB mass storage, mp3 player, 2.0 MP camera etc. But, it's still hard for me to handle, and I prefer a more rounded phone with well-shaped keys and an easier-to-use menu.",neutral

"I've been using this for 3-4 months now and it works well, But! it doesn't fit. I can hear clearly, and other people can hear me well. Battery life has not been an issue. It simply does not fit my ear. It dangles and has even fallen off before. I've tried right and left sides. I still use it since I got it for a good price, $30. I just wear a winter hat to secure it to my ear. Not sure what I'll do in the summer.",neutral

The title of the review says it all. These headphones work great with my w760a. The thing I was most concerned about was battery life. If this is your concern then don't worry. The first day I got these I charged them for 4 hours like the instructions said. I used them the whole next day (mostly listening to music and a few phone calls) and they never died. It may have been more than 8 hours I'm not sure but they definitely lasted 8 hours. My phones battery was at 75%. I love this phone/headphone combination and would recommend it to anyone.,positive

"I have about six of these devices, and I find that the worst part of all of them is that I can't keep them comfortably in my ear. Perhaps my ear is shaped weirdly (I don't think so... and in 64 years no doctor has, to my knowledge, remarked on the abnormal shape of my ears); or perhaps, these devices (despite a variety of adapters) just don't stay comfortably in a normal ear. Whatever it is... this Jawbone will take its place next to my other 5 bluetooth headsets, deep in my bureau drawer.",negative
I have no issues with this headset. I am very glad i took the chance and ordered it because the quality and price was perfect. In the store this item goes for 79-99 but i was able to purchase it brand new for 29.99. Great deal if there are any more left to purchase!,positive

"I recently was very curious based on the 'on' and 'off' reviews of this headset. The most vital part about having this headset is to replace the eargels with some high end ones. Thats all you need. I am professional musician and read another review stating to get the Etymotic ER6i eargels and stretching them on to fit. It made a DRAMATIC difference in the tonality of this stereo bluetooth. Its much better than the original earbuds provided with this headset. For 9 dollars more to buy a 5 pack of those right here on Amazon, to get better sound quality I found it completely worth it, especially with a price just under 32 dollars for this headset. I cant even complain about getting better eargels since its those little nuances that we often mistake as product error.",positive
"The industry builds phones with built-in obsolescence... so if you have an old phone, you're gonna get old batteries (even ""off the shelf""). This battery held a decent charge for maybe a couple of weeks. Now, as long as I don't use it, it's half-way dead by the afternoon.",negative
"I had this phone for six months before I had to throw it (metaphorically) against a wall. The phone has all the pieces to be a great device but seems carefully designed annoy. Caveat: I'm kinda a power user; if you just want a camera phone with a moderately useful addressbook, this product should do you fine. The biggest annoyances: * the location of the camera button. Inevitably, every time I took the phone out of my pocket it would be in camera mode, often with a couple pictures of my pocket. This means that every time you want to use the phone you first have to exit camera mode -- which completely negates the convenience of the little spring-loaded lid. * the interface. Nothing is consistent. Configuring one-touch dialing is completely separate from the address book is completely isolated from setting the ringtones. Having figured out how to configure something, it always took many minutes to remember how to change it. * synchronization. Don't use this phone if you have a computer. Not only was it painful to set up (I'm pretty technical, and synchronizing this phone with the Mac is not for the faint of heart), but the phone actually changed some data (moving addresses into the ""notes"" field). Seeing that was when I decided the phone had to go. This phone is marketed as a low-cost competitor to things like a BlackBerry or a Treo, but anybody who really wants an organizer on their phone would be poorly advised to use a Nokia. It's not worth the savings.",neutral

"First I bought the Motorola HS820 which worked well, but I wanted bettr mic sensitivity when using the piece with my smartphone, so I traded in and bought the HS850. The HS850 was much, much worse: It has a 'popcorn' kind of popping sound alot of the time, even when you're in a quiet room. The mic is horrible, it recognized a voice command 1 in 5 times. I traded it in and bought the Logitech Mobile Pro headset which works very, very well -- particularly for voice recognition/mic sensitivity. Best: Logitech, 2nd best: Motorola HS820 Worst: Motorola HS850",negative
"I purchased this phone @the price of $264. I previously owned the V60 and was dissapointed at the features and the major antenna problem. I also had difficulty justifying upgrading to the GSM/GPRS network. Motorola listened to customer feedback, and delivered a phone loaded with features. It's not quite a PDA but darn close. The phone itself is heavy, solid and sturdy, which leads me to believe its fairly durable, however, I did find a reccuring ""glitch"" in the display function. Which became quite annoying, as I couldn't read the time when I needed to. The biggest flaw I found in the phone was the battery life. I recently spent the weekend in seattle, and was fortunate that I had the charger with me, because I had to recharge 3 times that weekend. IMHO, If you're looking for a good phone with PDA features, you'll have to wait for another generation. If anybody needs me, I'll be on my digital service with my Panasonic Duramax phone.",neutral
"This is one of the best phones I have ever used, I have been with many of the top cellular phone companies and I can tell you that this is the best one. It has a mirrored face that looks much like the LG shine. Except the phone is a lot smaller and it fits in the little pocket of your jeans. The internet is quick on the phone, the camera takes sharp pictures which can be sent to all your friends quickly and the battery life is GREAT. For those who said different, you need to change the settings to maximum battery life by shutting off the back light. My phone lasts an entire day without having to charge when i do this. The sound quality is also great and the T9 on this phone works perfectly.",positive

"I just bought the phone about 1 week ago, the phone has a good battery life and lots of cool features. The thing I like about this phone is that when you send a Text message from AIM you are not counted for a whole text message. while with other phones if you send just a simple ""hi"" that is already 1 text message used. The thing I am [upset] about is that you can't download new games, I have tried soo much and you still cant. The pixelation is somewhat OK its not all that great and the Camera doesn't show good quality pictures. Overall this is a good phone, it has lots of nice features, lots of ring tones and more you can download including wallpapers. T-mobile customer service is great also but they need to expand their coverage area. If you are looking for a phone to buy for just talking all the time then buy this one, because it does give good Battery life, I didn't have to recharge it for about 2 days and I was talking on the phone and I was on T-Zones all the time.

"I've only had it a couple of weeks, but it's been so nice to not have to worry about my battery dying mid-day anymore. I can go two, two-and-a-half days now on a charge. I use my phone mostly for texting and web-browsing, some email, some Google Maps and Sky Maps, as a flashlight, a few non-intensive games; not a lot of phone calls. But with my old battery, same usage, I felt like I was doing pretty good if I still had 20% battery by the end of the work-day at 5ish. The phone is now heavier, but not by a great deal. I tend to carry it in my front shirt pocket, which tends to cause my shirt to sag (but for me, function tends to outweigh form), but that was true of my old battery, too. It's also a little thicker, too. So when I bought this battery, I also bought the case ($7-8-ish) that fits it, which I use some times, but I still tend to keep the phone in my shirt pocket a lot. With the battery came a back cover (that does not have the NFC antenna in it, so NFC doesn't work; I really like the NFC feature, but don't find it easy/convenient/practical enough to use it enough to make its absence noticeable to me, at least so far), and a ""case"" that covers the back and sides of the phone. I was surprised to find that included; I guess I didn't notice it in one of the product pictures, even though it's there. If this battery lasts, in good condition, for as much as a year, I will be completely sold on this product, and will likely remember the name ""PowerBear"" the next time I need a battery. I offered to buy one for my wife, but she doesn't want to lose her cute pink case (for her, form tends to outweigh function - pfft). So while she wears out charging cables (and then taking mine - arg) fighting to keep her battery charged, I just go about my day, smug in knowing that I'm fine with whatever charge I have until I can manage to get to a charger later in the day, or maybe even tomorrow.",positive
"This ""new"" replacement battery I bought at Amazon.com and received from ZenithMobile is probably used as it held its charge for barely 48 hours with minimal usage.

"Mates to any iGo device and plugs into any micro USB device, not only the ones listed on the title because the plug type is standardized. Built sturdily so it's grip on both ends is very tight. Not much else to say about this product.",positive
"SUMMARY: Works, but it's flawed. Pros: Will charge an iPhone 4S from 0% to 100% one time plus an iPad from 60% to over 90% on a single charge. It feels very nice in the hand. It's a moderate weight. Standard USB output. Nice satin black finish and pleasant-to-hold shape. Cons: Operation by the oh-so-cute single-button operation is confusing, and not helped by the oh-so-cute-and-short cryptic manual. The micro-usb input requires yet another cable type wherever you'll want to charge this thing. The four blue lights which show the extent of charge when it is being charged itself, do not appear to accurately report how much charge is remaining when it is charging a phone or whatever. (The lights over report how much charge the device itself has remaining.) The flashlight 'feature' is awkward to turn on, but can somehow turn itself on in a bag or pocket and drain the device. The laser-pointer 'feature' comes on before (!!) the flashlight in the press-sequence of the single button and can also turn itself on in a bag or pocket and drain the device. A single press of the button will turn the device on in a bag or pocket and drain the device - even when there is nothing attached to the device requiring a charge. There is no lock for the on/off button. And: The flashlight and laser pointer 'features' would have been better left out of the design. An option to light the device's sockets would make it easier to connect cables to the device in the dark of an aeroplane, a dimly lit conference room, etc.",neutral

"EDIT: I took a star off because after using it for a 8 - 12 months and the volume is getting quieter and quieter and harder to hear. I am having to order another one, might try another brand.

After mine came in, I bought some more for whoever wanted them in my office because they work so well and they are priced so reasonably.",neutral

It covers exactly only the part that lifghts up, the screen/monitor; it doesn't cover from the top top piece where it says ""Blackberry"".

I found the product to be easy to set up and use. It is comfortable to wear (sometimes forget I have it in my ear)and the sound is excellent. I have a much clearer audio signal using the wireless headset than I do when I use the actual cell phone. The cost was very reasonable. Would recommend this product.,positive

As far as elimination of background noise goes, it is better than the wired headset provided with the Iphone, but not by that much. I'm not sure why this product has gotten such rave reviews on Amazon.",neutral
"I purchased this at the local AT&T store as I needed a headset immediately when my two year old Motorola finally died. After purchasing two replacement Motorola H700s that worked for 3 weeks each and died, I was up for a change. A friend had recently purchased a Jawbone and told me her friends picked up her call from an airport, and they said it sounded great. That was appealing to me, so off I went. The 1st Jawbone was dead on arrival out of the box. It wouldn't light up to charge. AT&T cheerfully replaced it a few hours later the same day. 2 weeks later, the wire earloop, about the diameter of a paperclip, snapped where it goes through the main body of the Jawbone. They ship 6 in total, which are either right or left ear only. The second failed about two weeks later. The issue seems to be that the loop material is either too brittle, or to small in diameter in the name of fashion. The shape of the Jawbone is a little awkward to carry with you when it's not being worn. In a computer case, it can't really be flat, so the pressure from the side of the bag snaps it. The same thing happened when I put it in my jacket pocket. When I put on the seat belt in the car, it gently rubbed against the coat and number two was toast. The third one snapped in half when I was putting it on. One more thing - bring a friend or a mirror when you go to look at one. It pulls my ear funny, so it sticks out, which never happened with the Motorola. I am going to try the Blue Ant next, and see how that one fairs. For now, the Jawbone looks like a future good product, once they re-engineer the ear loops so they aren't so fragile.",neutral

"I've used this product for the past couple of days. Great design. Much smaller than you would expect from looking at the pictures. Here's a list of PROs and CONs. I won't cover anything you can get from the ""Technical Data"" section. PROs: 1) Call quality is great on the other end. People have commented that they didn't know I was calling them from my cellphone when using this headset. 2) You can turn off the headset by closing the mic boom. Unlike the older HS801 and maybe even the latest model, HS820, you can actually deactivate the headset just by folding the headset. Your phone will automatically revert to non-bluetooth mode. Open the mic boom and it'll sync automatically. Just make sure to set your phone to automatically detect the headset. 3) You can turn off the blinking lights while on a call so you don't look like a 'Star Trek' reject. Just press both volume buttons at the same time. The light will go off ONLY for the duration of that call. If it were up to me, I'd like to disable the lights altogether, but I'll take what I can get. 4) Great design. A must have for every got-to-have-it gadget person. And it matches the Motorola V600 perfectly. CONs: 1) Too quiet, even on the highest volume. The earphone is an open ear design so unfortunately, you can't really block out the sounds from your environment. When driving on the highway, this product becomes almost useless when calling someone who doesn't speak loudly. Doesn't help that my car's cabin isn't very quiet, so you may find the volume not an issue in a better acoustically sealed car. 2) Voice activation isn't very reliable. Only seems to work reliably in a quiet room. As with CON 1), you may not have an issue in a quiet car cabin. 3) The earpiece is not very comfortable. Again, this may not be an issue for you, but is for me. I'd give it a 6 or 7 out of 10, in terms of comfort. 4) The carrying case is very stylish, but poorly designed. The headset presses against the top of the case, causing the multi-function button to be continually pressed. The headset is off since the headset is folded, but continually pressing the multi-function button causes the lights to come on every few seconds within the caase. Maybe I'll try the neckstrap provided instead. Hope this helps.",neutral
"I really wanted to like the N78 - filled to the brim with all sorts of features in a very attractive case - but it was just too buggy to live with. Being able to set the phone up as a wireless access point using the brilliant JoikuSpot download was incredible, and certainly one of the things I'll miss most as I repackaged this and ship it back to Amazon. I feel (or at least hope) that my unit was just defective, so take some of the issues I had with a grain of salt - it may not happen on all devices, but here are some of the things I experienced: 1. Camera zoom stopped working after the first picture taken. It's a digital zoom, so not the most critical thing in the world, but still annoying when you want to frame a shot and can't. This was fixed when performing a factory reset using the *#7370# combination, however once I tried re-importing contacts, the camera zoom would break again. 2. I kept getting the phone's welcome message - about twice a day - no damnit, I don't want to see an introductory video on how to use the phone, leave me alone already! 3. Browser would crash and freeze constantly. 4. Phone would randomly restart - like right after going into Contacts to make a call. What I liked * JoikuSpot. One of the primary reasons I bought a Nokia - the ability to have a 3G based wireless access point on me at all times is really powerful and useful. * Screen. Bright, crisp, very nicely done * Design. Obviously very subjective, but I enjoyed looking at it in my hand - not something you can say about most Nokias * Predictive text. Coming from an old Motorola, I hadn't realized how horrible I had it. * Internet radio. I don't use my phone too much for music, but having all those internet radio stations has come in handy a few times and it's a pretty handy feature. What I didn't like: * Sluggish interface. This is my first Nokia smartphone, so I was expecting to see it fly based on all the reviews comparing this to previous Nokia models. There was a noticeable lag in everything I did. With fewer than 20 contacts on my phone, it took 1-2 seconds to load my list of contacts - meaning I couldn't just press ""Contacts + first letter"" to start filtering names right away - I had to pause for a second or two. * Menu-laden UI. I know there are plenty of shortcuts for this, but really, somebody needs to be taken out back and put out of their misery for the ridiculous number of menu options put in this phone. How often do people really make video calls - does that really have to be a default option when d-padding a contact's phone number? * Slow default browser. Opera Mini was orders of magnitude faster, but links from emails still open in the default browser, so having that suck still makes things frustratingly slow * Lack of camera lens cover. Not having it makes me nervous about ever putting the phone down on a hard surface Overall, I gave it 3 stars because I really liked the form factor, the screen, and just the sheer power of what it could do. If I could be assured that a new N78 wouldn't have the obvious issues mine had, I'd probably give it another go as there's really nothing else out on the market that has all this has for those in US 3G territory until the Xperia X1 comes out.",neutral
"The IMP52D is compact and powerful. It's attractive and feels good in the hand (weight, size, and shape). Able to charge all of my family's micro-USB phones and tablets, we have found it perfect for trips and also appreciate the added functionality of the bright flashlight and the laser pointer. If you're on the move and can't always stop long enough to charge your phone with a wall charger, the IMP52D is the perfect solution for portable power.",positive

"Got the unit in today. In my studio I get a solid one bar. If the phone rings I have to go stand by a window or often it will drop out. Big pain. If an important call comes in, I grab my phone and run to my porch to answer it. I used to have Verizon and the signal was great, but years ago I switched to AT&T so I could get an iPhone, and then I moved half a mile away...further from the tower, and my signal sucked. But I have a contract and a family plan of revolving phones, so I'm stuck with AT&T for a while. But this device looked like it could solve my problems. Unpacked the unit, mounted the antenna where I found 3 bars (on my cell) on my back porch roof. Ran the coax through my soffit into my attic and down one of the several 2' PVC pipes I had wisely installed when rebuilding my house. I run all sorts of stuff down these pipes, if you ever build, or rebuild a house and love electronics, this is a life-saver. They provide two lengths of coax and a coupler. Even though I didn't go far, the length of coax worked great, since I was dropping down a wall, out and up through my workstation table and then over to the inside unit location. I plugged everything in, got the green light on the unit and turned on my phone. Four bars. Wonderful. I called my wife to make sure it was a clear-sounding call and it was. Only reason for not doing 5 stars is because the unit doesn't broadcast that far. At my desk, 3 feet from the antenna, it's great. But when I walk around the house, the signal drops quickly. I can go about 30 feet away to my bedroom, and I'm back to one bar. Note, I'm pointing the antenna at the far side of the house, not towards my desk. I'm actually pointing the antenna away from me. If you're going to call it a 'home' unit, then the signal should transmit the area of a normal house. The only obstacle between the door of my room and the antenna is a wood and drywall wall. BUT, I'm glad that when an important client calls I don't have to scurry to my porch to make sure I don't have any problems on the call. So, bottom line, solid purchase and well worth the money. Wonder if I could buy an extra antenna and split the signal from the inside unit. I'll give Wilson a call. Would love to put a second antenna on the other side of the house.",positive

"I didn't realize that I placed 2 order for this item. I definitely didn't want two, but that was my error so I give one away. I got charge double for shipping. The product is what it looks like in the picture...it's plastic. Fits good, but the stand up key in the back is not real slim. It gets in the way. If you push the stand down to level with the case then it's super hard to pull it back out. Shipping cost more the case. I will definitely have to watch where and who I buy from to avoid or reduce the shipping cost.",neutral

I BOUGHT TWO OF THIS MODEL AND ONE CREATES NOISE AUDIBLE ONLY TO THE PERSON WEARING THE HEADSET WHICH FADES IF YOU TRY TO CHANGE YOUR LOCATION AS REPSEPCT TO HANDSET.

"This is a nice case that wraps around the edges, lifting the face off a flat surface. You will still need a screen protector, but this option provides protection, some grip and nice style. Unfortunately, there is a little plastic between the usb plug and the microphone that needs to be cut away to allow the plug to seat correctly. I would have also preferred a little more grip pattern on the back, but the side grip works well and now the phone is easier to grip and doesnt slide excessively on smooth surfaces.",neutral
"Nice product... not much to say. The only reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars is because the springy (+) tip to plug into my car's socket isn't very springy, and at first the thing wouldn't stay in the socket. I intend to hardwire though. For that purpose, the included cable is a little short (about 40"") if you need to custom route it. Otherwise it's a nice length. The product easily opens up and it looks like a power cord replacement is a simple solder job even for a novice like myself. I'm also impressed that they put an extra fuse on the inside of the device in case someone tries to put a bigger fuse into the thing to get more power. Looks like a very well constructed product for the price. As my review title explains, this will power the latest generations of iPod via the USB port. I successfully tried both a synching cable and a ""charging only"" cable.",positive
"I bought this phone with 1 year option back in Sep 2005 and being a savvy user of Old Palm PDA Vx thought it would be a great product but ... Pros: Very nice and FAST querries and features for phone book, calendar and general PDA stuff One hand operation Tonnes of extra stuff free/$$ including voice dial which searches your own phone book without any training etc Ring tone compatibility and if you how to do it it's FREE. Any MP3 can ring for you nice resolution vivid screen with several tweeks available bluetooth transfer to phone from your car works like a charm - well most of the times - see below External memory support for expansion :-) loved this feature OK to nice mp3 sound quality after messaging mp3's a bit and glad to say it's not a battery killer if played withh little monitoring. Cons: 3 out of 10 chances are if your two year old dropped it it won't come back 7 of 10 chances that if you're using bluetooth it will reboot right in the middle of the call 5 of 10 people will complain that they can't hear you or you can't hear them properly 8 of 10 chances (let's make it 9.5) you will hear static and hissing and hum sound along with or without bluetooth and/or speakerphone Great PDA bad phone worse bluetooth compatibility great sync and desktop software. I replaced three phones in 9 months as a part of warranty - thanks to cingular and then they finally gave me a blackberry 8700c. So my question to palm: What were you thinking???? Lesson learnt: Palm is a PDA and not phone: Will never EVER buy palm product other than ONLY a PDA which is not going to happen anyway. Just my 2c and no more",negative

"Improved audio and quality over previous models. Battery life is exceptional and performs as advertised. The ear hooks make a better fit and add comfort. The raised speaker helps u hear alot better. Depending on the volume ur phone or computer transmits, volume may not be a prob. When ever possible pair this with a BT 2.0, my LG chocolate is a BT 1.1, my pda a BT 1.2, and PC with BT 2.0+EDR. The sound quality is way better. 1 small annoyance exists. Sometimes when pairing a motorola headset to my LG Choc II phone and other BT 1.1 phones, u might get a connection that has static and kinda cuts on and off. The solution is simple after many experiments. Delete the pairing and re- pair your BT headset, it forces a change in the communication channel to a clear one. Too many people use the 2.4Ghz range, Wireless internet, cordless phones, BT devices, COmputer CPUs. Used with skype, works flawlessly with xcellent range on a BT2.0+EDR Class2 PC dongle.

"VoSKY Call Center looks good on paper, but the software is extremely bad and the product is almost unsupported by Actiontec.

Bugs I have encountered include randomly crashing Skype, automatically changing Skype sound card settings to incorrect values (ensuring it cannot work), hanging up Skype calls with a phone line disconnected message, even though there is no line disconnect (and even though the phone line is not being used so it should not matter), incompatibility with basic Windows features like fast user switching, incompatibility with non-administrator Windows users, requirement that you be logged into Windows to use, and so much more. I strongly recommend against purchasing this product, and from this experience I personally plan to avoid all Actiontec products. I've had this product for almost a year, and the defects have actually become worse with the few software updates they have done in that time (a few bugs fixed, but more bugs added with each release).",negative

"I've had this phone for 3 months, after using mostly blackberrys and Samsung flip phones for the past 7 years. Samsung makes very good phones. Overall: I am generally happy with the phone. The battery life is good, and the Verizon network is the best I have experienced ever. The phone looks great, and has many functions. However, I have not explored everything on this phone yet. The basic web function is good. The screen is excellent. I love the voice recognition software - it is excellent and works well. The speakerphone function is okay - not great, but useable. I have dropped it a few times, without a problem thus far. It is thin and the weight is acceptable. Complaints: It is easy to drop and rather slippery due to its very smooth and glossy exterior. The keypad is mediocre; Blackberry still has the best keypad for emails or other text. With this keypad, I need to use my nails. If I had no nails, I would find it very challenging. The calendar & calculator functions could be better integrated. Bottom line: I was hoping to use this as a PDA/phone, and am finding it difficult at times. I guess it was not truly designed to be used as a PDA, although it has the basic functions of a PDA. I haven't used the music function, so cannot speak to that.",neutral

"After owning this thing for two months the blue indicator light stopped working right. It used to blink red when turning off, and blue when turning on. However, after a while it stopped blinking red when turning off, and the blue indicator stayed on all the time, so I could never tell whether it was on or off without testing it with my phone. This should have clued me in that this device was not going to last, and sure enough another month or so later it became unusable. It worked, but people on the other end would hear really loud feedback noise, like heavy traffic or like they were standing next to the ocean during a storm trying to listen to me. Obviously they could barely hear me talk and the noise was irritating.

This allows me to set aside my phone but still can receive calls anywhere in my house, very convenient. One glitch I found is that the touch tone sent using my home phones does not seen to be delivered correctly over to the recipient end, thus company voice mail boxes and other automatic phone services won't work.

"Whether one blames it on the design of the Centro itself or on the battery, the length of time a Centro can run on this battery is too short. After a few months of use a Centro battery will barely sustain the device for a 12-hr. day even if no calls are made (and that's without Bluetooth's being active, which makes things worse). The time between charges can be improved by disconnecting the phone from the mobile service provider when you don't need it, provided you don't need it to be active for incoming calls, and de-activating Bluetooth when not needed. I don't know that there's much that can be done about this with current (pun intended, sort of) technology. Batteries are charged (there I go again) with providing more and longer power as each processor runs faster and a single device serves as a PIM/PDA, telephone, camera, MP3 player, data repository, and auxiliary brain for its user, at the same time as those very same marvels get even lighter & more compact, leaving little room for the battery, which occupies a significant portion of the device. The battery slips easily into the Centro or a separate charger. I highly recommend buying a spare battery with charger--that combination is available--especially if you plan to use the phone for playing MP3s too. The good news about the battery's being small, which of course is why it doesn't last long throughout the day, is that you can stick a spare in your wallet, pocket, or purse without much bother. A car charger is also helpful to give your heavily utilized Centro a second wind during the day. If you plan to travel with it--and that's obviously when the device is at its most helpful, carry along enough charged-up spares to get you between home and hotel power outlets. Under travel conditions you may want to have at least one charger for every two batteries; the chargers fortunately aren't much bigger than the battery, except for the cord.",neutral

"My brother actually upgraded his line on our account and selected this phone. He got it for around 30 bucks and said nothing but great things. After discovering it was a touch screen and playing with it for a couple of minutes, I wanted one, so I upgraded my line, too. I'm a HUGE texter. I'll send out 5000+ texts a month easy. I was excited that this phone had both the regular keyboard with predictive texting as well as the QWERTY keyboard. That is until I discovered that the QWERTY keyboard is QWERTY crappy... which is okay because I type faster using predictive text anyway. So I changed my settings to use predictive text every time I send a message, right? Apparently not. First problem I had with this phone was when I discovered that it would random revert back to standard text and I'd have to manually change the settings back to T9. Angered me every single time I had to do it. It stopped for a while, but eventually always does it again. With that in mind, somewhere around the 1 month mark, the touch screen pooped out on me. I would touch a 1 and it'd think I was touching a 9. There was nothing I could do, no recalibration could restore the accuracy. VERY difficult to text, let alone actually dial a number. Phone was practically useless with the exception of answering calls. Next thing I know... my battery, which wasn't good to begin with, is completely shot. After about 3 months of service, my battery will NOT hold a charge. It'll work long enough for me to answer a call, but as soon as I hear ""hello,"" it's gone. Had to replace the battery. New battery is almost as bad. Speaking of the battery, the charge cord is TERRIBLE! I've gone through three. The cheap design is just so easy to break and I'm very gentle on my phones. It doesn't even stay firmly pressed into the phone anymore and I have to angle it just to get it to charge. In addition to these fatal flaws, the browswer sucks. I took my data package off because it was torture to try to use the internet on the phone. Many of my calls go straight to voice mail. The phone has absolutely no storage whatsoever. Did I mention the headset jack? How about the bluetooth? Oh, wait... the former is missing in action and the latter has never worked.

The battery life is impressive. After a month of use I have only charged it the initial time. I use it almost every day on my drive home from work (about 15 minutes) and also fairly often on the weekends. The profile is very slim so you could easily toss this into your briefcase or purse.

"Whenever I get a new portable device, one of the first things I do is buy a screen protector, then I have my husband apply it. When hubby got a Blackberry, I ordered these right away. When they arrived, I told him to put one on. Whenever I try to put something on like that, I end up with a mess. Well, hubby waited too long for my taste, so when he forgot his phone one day, I opened these up and stuck it on his BB myself. If you watch which side you start with, these things are klutz-proof. I peeled the backing on the sticky side, aligned it, and pressed from one edge to the other. I got not one single bubble! Then I removed the backing on the outer side, pressed and polished. You can't even tell it's there! It's staying put quite nicely and is keeping the BB in mint condition. Just remember when you get them that there are two sides to these protectors, and you'll be fine. It's a great product.",positive

"This was my first bluetooth headset. I love the fact that you could just close/open the boom to turn it off and on! I also liked that you could charge it from any Micro USB cable. It was rather flimsy feeling on my ear though, and felt if I spun my head too fast it would come off. I also had a hard time hearing the person on the other end because of the poor connection it made with my ear (or maybe I'm just spoiled by the ear bud gel tip on my Plantronics 975 now!). This would have gotten four stars, but about four months in to having it the microphone out of nowhere stopped functioning. Literally one call it was fine, but the next one less than a minutes later it was no good. It never worked again. The only thing keeping it at three stars was the incredible battery life. I never remember this thing dying on me! It definitely one-ups the 975 there. I hear ""beep-beep-beep, battery low"" on it every day, but I honestly couldn't tell you how the Motorola H710 tells you it's running out of juice! The battery life is that great! All in all, I'm much happier with my Plantronics Discovery 975, and wish I had bought it to begin with despite the price.",neutral

"We put this on our window to improve reception in our apartment, it helped slightly but not that much. I think it had a hard time keeping the signal because the signal was still pretty weak by the window. When we moved apartments that had even worse reception, this didn't help at all. My suggestion is only get this if you have a spot where you get a strong signal and need to extend it.",neutral
"I recently purchased a Jawbone as a gift. It arrived poorly packaged and without instructions. The small recharging port cover was damaged.

The moral of this story is to buy from a store, in person, looking the product in the eye.",negative
"I installed this unit according to instructions. I installed the antenna where the strongest signal was (2 bars). The unit did work but not to what I needed. I could only get a signal maybe no more than 10-15 feet from the antenna. I ordered the option booster indoor antenna and it helped a little but not much more. Maybe 20 feet. I needed the unit to cover more area and this only covers the room you are in, if the room is not larger than maybe 20 feet. I ended up installing it at my inlaws camp where they don't have a useable signal inside or outside. This worked with a weak signal on their roof but gives them plenty of signal for their camp to make calls. About five feet from the inside antenna you will get 3-4 bars. It decreases of course, the further you move away. If you need service in one room, I would recommend this unit. Otherwise, upgrade to something for the whole house. One thing to note: Signal bar strength is not an indicator for actual signal strength. A device that measures db's would be needed for this if your phone cannot be put into test mode. My can but it reported a number that was not a db. This device would allow you to point your outside antenna toward the strongest signal. Cell phones update themselves at periodic intervals so you would have to stand and turn, wait, stand and turn, etc.",neutral
"I really was excited to get this phone but it has really disappointed me. The main things I hate on this phone is that wifi is extremely slow, the alarm goes off all the time even when I do not turn it on and the touch pad volume control sucks!

Just buy this. You can't go wrong with it. Has the best sound qualtity from all headsets I've used. It can be worn with or without the ear loop. Fit is very comfortable. Plus it can be paired to 3 different devices. Buttons are not easily bumped and make calls unintentionally.,positive
"Two Thumbs Up! This was my 3rd bluetooth headset and I was about to just give up on them. However, this little guy proved me wrong. A few points ... - Terrific pairing with my iPhone - Great sound - Really good at picking up my voice (didn't need to cup my mouth as I drove down the road and look like an NFL coach on the sidelines) - Comfortable - Good battery life - Functional and Inexpensive -- I'm not paying $150 bucks for a JawBone and I'm not interested in using it as a fashion accessory. My only criticisms would be to make it easier to fit in my front shirt pocket. I like to take it off when I'm not on the phone.

"I spent a lot of time researching iPhone cases before finally deciding to go with this one, and I can honestly say I couldn't be happier with my decision! A 'naked' iPhone is actually a bit to thin and slippery to comfortably use on a daily basis, and the rubberized silicone cases are impossible to pull in and out of a pocket. This case solves both of those problems, and looks great doing it. Other iPhone owners always ask where I got it, and some have even gone on to purchase it themselves to be equally satisfied. My friends who don't have an iPhone are shocked when I pop it out of the case - they thought it was part of the phone! It has a great feel that really is hard to describe - it's a ""soft"" texture on a very hard surface. Strange, but it couldn't be a more comfortable surface for something that you touch many times throughout the day. You'll be very happy with this case!",positive

I bought this because for some reason our house is a Verizon wireless dead zone. We mounted it in 4 different locations in the house & with the antenna inside and out and at every single location the base unit flashed and said that the signal was too strong. Too strong?

I then moved it to the passenger's side visor where it was excellent for listening to calls but the people with whom I was speaking said they could not hear me. Also, the noise of the air conditioner (even on low) made it so the person with whom I was speaking could not hear me at all. I then started holding it in my hand when I was using it -- which completely defeats the unit's hands-free purpose. Finally, I gave up.

"A little disappointed in the advertising. The picture shows the side slots can accommodate iPhones with room to spare. But the package that we received had a photo on the pavkaginf of the old flip phones. I wonder if I hit the correct item. It is the exact same thing but is smaller than the advertised photo displays. I was able to place my iPhone 6s in the left slot but it is so tight that the outside edge of the box is protruding. I also placed an iPhone 6 in the right slot and it is also so snug that the edges protrude I have s small Kindle Fire in thdcenter slot but due to the angle of the charger hole, it must be held over the top edge. I do like that I can put the multi plug in the back section and all the cables are concealed. I'm a little worried that the edges of the case might end up giving way due to the phones pressing against them. My iPad will not fit in any of the slots so I am laying it down in front.

"New Trent IMP52D charger is sleek and well designed. The smaller size makes if convenient to carry in a briefcase, purse or ""go bag"" for emergencies or daily use. It would be well suited for the business traveler with the onboard laser pointer and the white LED. Don't be fooled by the smaller size. This charger does the job intended. I have owned and used a Mophie in the past and found the New Trent much quicker and longer lasting than the Mophie. In addition to the good looks and size the IMP52D charges quickly with a wall charger and does a great job extending the battery in my iPhone. I am in the first duty cycle and finding the IMP52D adds about 1% charge to my iPhone per minute. As expected the IMP52D takes additional time to charge my iPad, but with the extra amperage draw needed to charge the iPad the extra time is not unreasonable. The iTorch has a great hand feel. Immediately out of the box I noted the different from the other chargers I have used. The smaller design with smaller LEDs makes it not only functional, but aesthetically pleasing to both touch and sight. I look forward to the ability to keep my devices charged and ready by using this well made product.",positive

"I previously owned an H700 headset and based on my great experience I purchased the H12. I was especially interested in the H12's noise cancelling feature. Was I disappointed. First, the fit is not nearly as natural as the H700. The earpiece must go into the ear canal and it never stays put even with the alternate size foam cushions that are supplied. People I converse with while using the H12 are constantly telling me that I am breaking up even when we both have excellent reception (5 bars). People I spoke with via the H700 and my Blackberry never mentioned a problem. Also, the volume of the headset is more difficult to adjust, maybe because of the ear cusion but a couple of times I almost deafened myself by adjusting the earpiece to too loud a setting. Maybe my fault but still a nuisance. The noise cancelling feature doesn't seem to work but that may also be due to the ill fitting design. I don't know and I don't care. I am so aware of this annoying thing in my ear that I don't even use it anymore. In my opinion get the H700 and fall in love with bluetooth.",negative

I am using this device for smart phones that I also use it as MP3 player, video player, GPS on the road, WIFI hotspot to share data with my tablet...etc. The tiny internal phone battery just won't last for a few hours. With IMP500 huge 5000mah capacity, I don't need to get near a computer or AC outlet for a few days on a trip. As a reference, most phone internal battery rated 1100mah to 1500mah. With IMP500, you have 3 to 4 times capacity to power the phone. Pros - Massive 5000mah capacity - Relatively small in size - light weight - Flexible with different device tips to charge different phones. - Recess power button so it won't get turned on by accident - Very portable retractable cable reduced cable tangling. Cons - Piano finish attract finger prints and scratches all over the body - I always worry I will lose the tip when using the same cable to charge the IMP500. I'm very happy with this product. If they can make the charging DC in using micro USB instead of the round pin, it would be an even better product.

"The description of this case is overstated. It is simply a slim rubber case, and at that it is a decent one. It adds very little bulk, and in fact blends in to the point some people will think your phone does not have a case. Very sharp-looking. And I can't speak for all shipping destinations, but I got this super-fast: I ordered it Sunday night and got it Tuesday. But the description really made me expect it to do everything including mow the lawn. A few nit-picks that may be relevant to users: -- Being so low-profile, I would expect it to provide very little shock protection, if any at all. I'll be careful not to drop my phone! -- It is all one piece of rubber, just with two finishes. I did not think that was clear in the description. -- The matte finish is slick. I cannot use it one-handed if I'm touching the matte finish. The glossing finish is nice and sticky, making it easy to hold. Unfortunately, the glossy finish is only about 20% of the back! -- The ""grippy"" sides are not so grippy. Trying to use the phone one-handed with my fingers wrapped around the far side, they slip off. I would have expected the textured side edges to be very easy to grip. They are not. -- If you're a perfectionist, you ought to know that the feature cut-outs do not center over the features. I think all of my features still work (I can plug in the charger and headphone jack, the camera is not obstructed, etc.), but if you care about alignment you'll notice this. The power and volume rocker bumps are a little out of alignment as well, which doesn't affect your ability to use them, as long as you squeeze where they are, and not on the bumps themselves. Overall I'm not displeased with this purchase, but I wish i hadn't paid $11 for it. Other than aesthetics it has nothing on the $0.99 rubber cases out there, and it's probably not as easy to hold as they are.",neutral

"First off, it works well. It is a solid, well-made piece that does it's job of charging the phone. It is easy to place the phone in and hard to tip the phone over once in the dock.

However, I decided to place this dock on the nightstand next to my bed at night as I'm sure many others plan to do. Unfortunately, the blackberry insignia on the dock shines an extremely bright white light. There is also no way to turn it off and it ends up illuminating the entire room. It is even lit up when the phone is not on the charging unit. For anyone planning on using this in another room rather than where they sleep or who have no problem sleeping with light in the room, it's a great device.

We looked so amateur with our little meter and felt bad we brought the guys out based on a reading from a cheap device. Better safe than sorry, but it certainly would have abated our concerns from the start had the meter been accurate. We could have received a faulty meter, but there was no way of knowing until the professionals came to prove otherwise. We are sending it back, but evidently we will not get a full refund because it is outside 30 days.",negative

"I had no problem linking my headset with my Motorola RAZR cell phone. Operation with my cell phone was acceptable. However, the little plastic ear loop didn't work to keep the headset on my ear. If I leaned over, it fell off. Then, the fragile plastic loop broke off as I was removing it to charge the headset battery. You have to remove the loop every time you charge the battery, so you will have lots of opportunity to break the fragile loop. This was perhaps only the third time I was charging the battery since I had it for such a short time. I called Samsung and they quickly recognized the description of my problem and said they would send me a couple more of the ear loops, no charge. When the headset goes out of warranty and all the loops are broken, I guess I'll just have to throw the headset away.",neutral

"I purchased this last year and after 6 months returned it due to buzzing noise in speaker, people also complained that I had a very bad echo. After multiple calls to Motorola they finally had me return defective unit and replaced it. Now the second unit has zero battery life, I charge it the LED goes solid green quickly and when I take a call within minutes it announces battery life and cuts off. When the unit work it appears to work well but this design appears to suffer from quality problems in battery selection or quality as well as speaker mounting.",negative
"Naturally for me the Treo 680 was my first smartphone choice from Cingular a long while back, and I expected great things from it. During the first stretch of the honeymoon period I LOVED this device, for it was basically a lateral move from my previous Palm TX pda. All the calendar entries and contact information had synched with no trouble at all to my Mac and other than the added phone application nothing much else felt any different. Then came the battery life that left much to be desired! Usually I am a stickler for recharging my devices EVERY night even when there is more than enough power for the next day. But nightly charging with the 680 had become a NECESSITY! Without overnight charging the Treo would barely make it past my morning coffee. It seemed like just navigating the menus with the stylus brought down the battery level right before my eyes! I took a chance on the qwerty keyboard in texting and word docs editing and did not like the feel of the buttons at all. They were cramped, too small and the feedback too rigid for any sort of comfortable typing with my fingernails. My current Nokia E61i qwerty feels like plush cotton compared to the Treo 680 and its buttons are perfectly spaced. The camera is good for what it is: a basic snapshooter. There is no way to expect any kind of great resolution or vivid colors from the VGA camera, but it gets the job done nonetheless. Call quality was truly excellent and is up to par with my Nokia. Actually I will admit that the Treo's call volume was better in comparison to my E61i. Reception, on the other hand, was a little bit shaky in my daily usage. There were a few times when the phone would reset itself in standby or in the middle of a call, but not as frequently as my first Sony Ericsson p990i. Wifi has become a standard that I have become accustomed to in smartphones and it is a shame that this Treo does not have it...but at the same time it isn't a dealbreaker either. Eventually I took the device back to Cingular due to the unwieldy bulkiness and horrible battery life. Despite this return, the Treo was an okay device that was an adequate introduction to the world of smartphones. We've all gotta start somewhere.",neutral
"I paid the full list of $89.99 for this subcompact headset 5 years ago. It was the only one out of many I tried that fit my ear and remained in place without resorting to an over-the-ear loop. This headset has served me well over the years. It paired effortlessly with both my prior and current phones the very first try and has worked flawlessly ever since. It charges quickly and has around a four-hour talktime before it gives a low-power signal. The charger-cum-carrying case, which at first seemed a little odd, has made tremendous sense in the long run. The only downside to this design is that if one should carelessly misplace the case they would be unable to charge the headset, but over time the convenience and utility offered by this arrangement has been well worth that risk. Since the standby battery life seems to be several days, the headset, kept in this little case, usually resides in my pocket until I need it. Since it pairs so readily with my phone, I only turn it on if I need to conduct a hands-free conversation, and it connects almost immediately. If I use it during the day, I charge it in the evening. I highly recommend this to others.",positive
"First time I bought this to pair up with my jabra a210 bluetooth adapter. Worked fine, except that the vibrate feature won't work. Then I exchanged it for another one. This time the vibrate works, but the call pickup button would not work. It works for power up/power down. But I can't pickup any incoming calls. The button simply wouldn't work for that functionality. I tried it with few phones and it doesn't work. I already exchanged the jabra adapter once. Now I'm sick of exchanging it. I think jabra has bad quality control. Someone in the quality control shd be fired! Everytime you exchange something, you run into a new problem.",negative

I was in the market for a new cell phone. I came across the new motorizr. I had bought a samsung slider phone but returned it back to the store. One thing I like about this phone is it large easy to use keypad. The rubber on the outside of the phone keeps it from slipping out of your hand when you are opening and closing it. It has a powerful 2.0 megapixel camera. The pictures comes out crisp and clear. And the LED light is also just as powerful. I just love the phone. The keypad glows nicely at night. It just don't light up. You will love it.,positive
"I purchased the Jabra JX10 after doing a lot of research, both here and on many other sites. If you have not seen the headset, it is very discreet and fashionable as advertised. The headset charged in exactly 2 hours using the usb charger included. Pairing with my Samsung A900 was a snap. The unit is extremely light and very comfortable on the ear using the supplied ear clip (I wear glasses and the ear clip was never in the way or the least bit uncomfortable). The first few calls made were crystal clear, so long as I had my phone on the same side as the headset. Issue #1: I was not able to get anywhere near 30ft away from the phone (more like 3 feet) before I experienced static. The same day I purchased the JX-10, and shortly after fully charging the headset, I went to the mall to do some more shopping. During the drive to the mall, I was able to talk on the headset with the windows down without any complaint from the person on the other end of the call. As a matter of fact, I don't think they even noticed I had taken the call from home to the car, even while driving with the windows down. I guess the DSP really does work. Issue #2: Once in the mall the headset became unusable. I became frustrated and turned the Jabra off and started using my phone to complete my call. The sound would drop in and out. While in it was crystal clear, when it dropped out there wasn't any static, just no sound. Again all the while, even with the issues I was experiencing on my end of the call, I don't think the caller knew I was on a headset during the sound issues. I returned the Jabra the same evening after the visit to the mall. I couldn't justify the price for the poor performance. With that said...many people seem to be having good luck with the JX-10. My advise, if you purchase any headset, put it through the paces as soon as you can in order to find out if it is right for you or not. I plan to try the Discovery 645. ***Update 7/30/06*** When I did this review of the JX-10 awhile back I rated it 3 stars because it was plagued with static (on my end). I extremely disappointed the JX-10 didn't perform for me, to the same standards so many reported in their glowing commentaries. After going without a Bluetooth headset for a time, I began to reflect on the good qualities I did experience. I jumped at the opportunity to purchase another JX-10 when the price dropped. I am happy to proclaim the JX-10 is as good as others have reported! Beware, the second unit I purchased a was defective and had to be exchanged, which led me to believe the first unit I purchased, a month or two ago, may have also been defective. I would go as far as saying, if your JX-10 doesn't immediately exceed your expectations in performance, call Jabra customer service for support or exchange the unit. You may find this information important: My provider is Sprint and my phone model is the Samsung A900. I'm glad I gave the JX-10 a second (third) chance because it is truly an extremely high-end, high quality Bluetooth headset. Go get yours now!",neutral
I purchased one of the iGo wall chargers from another retailer several years ago for an outrageous amount of money and the special tips were very expensive too. The universal charger eliminates the clutter of several separate chargers around the house. I purchased a tip for all my rechargeable electronic gear. It is my favorite charger. It seems to charge the devices faster then some of the other chargers. I purchased the automobile version of the charger for travel. I am glad to see Amazon carrying both products at a greatly reduced price.,positive

"Just got the Sidekick II and spent literally an hour with tech support trying to get around a bug. They said nobody before had asked them that question. I call a lot overseas and, surely, don't dial directly due to the cost. I use a calling card, a pin and then the number. Even the oldest cell phones have a much longer field length on the phone number, so that you can program the calling card (10 digits), the pin (10 digits) and a foreign number (12+ digits). The Sidekick II stops on the 28th digit! What an annoyance. I found, however, that if I use the speed dial function, the field length is not restricted. With only 9 speed dials, though, this is not much help. Another bug is that if you do a select-copy-paste on a phone, and copy the number to another speed dial (so I don;t have to type the calling card for every entry), it pastes the whole seeting, including the name and then doesn't let you change it. A third bug is that the phone does not allow you to save a draft of a text message. If you are not able to send a message (system outage etc), you can't just save the message to send later, but you have to retype it. Looks like the Sidekick II does not allow any change in color, plates or walpaper either. I like the phone - it's fun and very intuitive, but at this time I am pondering whether to return it and stick with my Nokia 3650 which gives me all of the same, just without the bugs. I activated a new account with TMobile, but I have little hope they'll let me carry over my old number. My plan was just to cancel the old service..but I may give it a try if I keep the phone. I wish these engineers didn't sleep on the job and stopped these annoying bugs from happening. After all, how hard is it to set a longer text field, if you are setting it on the speed dial anyway.. Oh...did I say the phone also doesn't allow you to add a memory card? Good toy, though...I am nervous about putting work data on it, keeping in mind TMobile has access to it. Sure their servers are secure, but so are all banks...and they do have crackdowns from time to time.. So...still thinking about it..",neutral
"Got this to replace a Plantronics 510, and so far my reaction is mixed. Pros: Lightweight, snug fit, great audio clarity Cons: Voice dialing doesn't work To elaborate, while the audio is great... I do miss the hands free voice dialing. I tried pairing this phone with a Motorola Razr and simply couldn't get it to work. The problem is that voice dialing is activated by holding the single button down for a ""long"" press. (Unfortunately, hold it down too long and you deactivate the phone.) Once I got the timing right, the phone still wouldn't recognize any of the names I tried saying. The message that displays on the phone about ""Speak the name"" also disappears way too fast by itself. I had no problem before with the 510, but this 610 has problems in that area. Oh yeah, for kicks I tried pairing it with a Samsung t619 too. Although the phone thinks its paired up, it doesn't register anything I do beyond that. Yeah, next time I think I'll go back and get another 510 instead. So... I guess it's still a decent buy if you get cheaply and don't use voice dialing. But otherwise...",neutral
"I bought this headset since it allows you to pair it with 2 devices. I needed it to pair with my iPhone 3G as well as the VOIP software on my laptop.

"I bought the item, got it on a Friday, used it Saturday and it came apart. The main problem is the armband is way too small. I am not a big armed person by any stretch of the imagination and I had a hard time getting it to fit so it would not slide off during a workout. Because the strap is too small for me, I have to pull it a bit so the velcro catches. That looked ok at first, but by the end of my very first time using it, the plastic facing had started to detach from the backing (its merely glued on and the glue separated). Once the facing is loose, I was concerned about dropping my iPhone and bearing the expense of a new one. Belkin could do better if they added a couple inches to the strap. But, the plastic facing glued to the backing still leaves a bit of concern. If you have very small arms (child-like arms) then perhaps this will work for you.",negative

"Ok I'm taking away one star because the color is slightly different than what is pictured. It is more like a canary yellow (bright).

BUT all of this is mute because I'm returning the case for a completely different reason. A few hours after I placed my phone inside the case I dropped my phone and the screen shattered so I'm off to buy a new phone, obviously an IPhone 6 so I won't be needing the 5c case. Also, be warned this case in by no means a protective case for your phone, it is not shatterproof. Other than all this I think it works great, I let my phone battery drain and used the device to charge and it charged quickly.

It does get quite hot when a battery is in it being drained to your iPod. For camping, this could be a handy little item. After my iPod died, I hooked this little guy up and burned through about 3 batteries (iPod NOT in use while charging) and got about 50% of my iPod's battery power back. It seemed to deplete faster than a ""normal"" charge, but that could have been my imagination.

"After reading the other reviews I had to write one, cuz I have mixed feelings about the phone. Having used pocket pcs in the past I am biased because of the wonderful things WiFi brings to this phone. Truly. I agree with comments about phone functionality. I have trouble hearing at times. Ring is too quiet. Works great with the earpiece but when you try to end the call with the earpiece, an Incall results almost all the time. So end your calls with the red button, please. Speakerphone only for quiet places. And always always shut off the pda when you holster it because the phone constantly redials the last number you called. Diligence and diligence alone can prevent the embarrassment of being overheard by someone you just talked to. I love the keyboard. My kids love the keyboard. My wife loves the keyboard. Great functionality for texting and Email. Especially with WIFI. Get Opera for mobile phone. Works great with this phone and can surf for free at hotspots. Check stocks etc etc. It really improves the functionality. Great for games and compose thoughts, calendar, todo list, as with PPC. Great for [...] - listen to books and music. Great for downloading with WIFI - again improves functionality. Great device for traveling and waiting... pull it out and do things. The battery - get a second and keep it in your pocket. Works for me. I rarely need it as I charge all the time, in car, on PC, Wall socket. Just really not an issue for me. Bulky and holstering is a pain. But that seems to be part of the deal. Lots of brains in this device, can be fun if you are patient. But the phone as a phone is a bugger at times. Just need to decide if you can put up with that.",neutral

"I like the Treo Centro. It runs on the very dependable Sprint CDMA/EV-DO network. But it is the same phone as the Treo 600 that came out back in 2003. Palm decided that since the 600 was such a big success, that they had no need to make any kind of effort in designing a new phone. This holds true with the Centro. This phone has the (((SAME))) hardware as the Treo 600, 650, 700, 750, ect. Just a bit more memory and a so-called updated OS. The OS might have an update number of 5.4.9, but there is zero difference in the OS. I can not tell a difference at all. This is sad seeing as they made a Lunix based OS called Cobalt years ago and it has never seen the light of day. The Centro still has the same bugs as every Treo since the 600. Start-up time is very slow. Which is really bad when you are in need of making an important phone call, and the phone resets for no reason. Making you wait up to 60+ seconds for it to come back online. The limited RAM of 64MB's, is so much lower then most PDA's currently on the market. You can use ZLaucher to transfer programs to a memory card, but this can not be done with all software. And since the web browser uses RAM, not memory cards, you still only have 8MB's to work with in Blazer. All software must be loaded into RAM before being it can run, So prepare for the phone to reset at least once a day to get the those limited RAM resources back. Still no WiFi, which was the complaint in 2003 and Palm has not added it yet. The Centro still has the same 312 MHz Intel XScale processor. Signal strength is still pretty strong, but voice quality is still not great when compared to every other phone I have used before. Sprint is marketing this as an affordable PDA at $99 with a contract. But when you know that the hardware is going on 5 years old, price really doesn't make current PDA owners care a whole lot. I bought the Centro because I hated my Motorola RAZR 2 and I needed to get something better. But after using the Centro for over a month now, I see no difference what-so-ever in this PDA and the Treo 600 and 650 that I owned a few years ago. Smaller packaging, but the same phone. The Centro is a good example of what a PDA maker SHOULD NOT DO. While Motorola, Nokia, Samsung, HTC, ect have all updated their lineups with powerful PDA's, Palm has sat idly by doing nothing with their forum star power. Palm used to control a huge chuck of the PDA software market, but now Microsoft has caught up and passed PalmOS by. No new companies have used PalmOS. Let me rephrase that, NO ONE is using the PalmOS anymore; except for Palm. So if you don't have a PDA and want an affordable one, then the Centro might be for you. If you want power, then Sprint has much better PDA's then the aged and milked-to-death Treo's. More then likely the Centro will be the last PDA-Phone ever made by Palm. They have lost crazy amounts of market share and have been laying off employees. So who knows, maybe the Centro will be a collectors item. A PDA that has never evolved, never been fixed, never been changed in any, meaningful way. Treo",neutral

"This headset works exactly as advertised. It sits in my ear and it cancels an almost unbelievable amount of noise.

He said it sounded like I was holding the phone to my ear in a quiet room. The headset has a long standby time and a very good amount of talk time. I use it mainly for business, and therefore use it every day, and several times a week I have hours-long telephone meetings. The battery never runs out on me unless I don't charge it for a day or two. Most times I can get by charging it every other day. Another nice thing is that most of the time charging it only takes twenty minutes or half an hour, and I can charge it from any USB port. I am connecting it to an iPhone 3G, and I have had no connection issues there. I also used it for about a week with the original iPhone, and also had no issues. So, perfect call quality, long battery life, no Bluetooth connection issues. Why the three stars? Well, like many, many other people on here, I have to point out that the included accessories to fit the headset in your ear just do not work. Based on reviews I read here, I ordered a pack of Jabra Ear Gels at the same time as the headset, and I'm really glad I did. I tried all the combinations of the included accessories, and could find nothing that came even remotely close to fitting my head. With the Jabras, it fits fine. I use it without an earstrap, and am never nervous about it falling out. If Jawbone had included some with the headset, I'd give it 5 stars, no question. Because it requires an additional product, it loses 2 stars. It would be more, but this is an Amazon review, and the ear gels are linked right from this page, so it's not like they're hard to find.",neutral

Sometimes the person I call cant hear me and sound is messed up,negative
"It works well, and I love how small it is. I haven't figured out if it's too small or not (I am afraid I might lose it). Sound quality is good and it holds a charge well. It was not expensive, and that matters a lot. *** UPDATE *** It's been 4 months and I haven't lost it!!! I like the little pouch it came with (that's handy in my purse). I like how light weight it is. It fits my ear well and is flexibal if needed. Yep, I think this is a good buy!",positive
"This phone is very comfortable to wear. You should be able to easily keep it in your ear for hours while walking around. It is very secure; no worry about it falling off. When I am indoors, I put my cell phone on a desk and go fairly far from it with excellent reception and voice quality. But, one major reason for getting this handset is so that I could keep my Razr V3C in my pants pocket and walk around with the headset on. This is where I have gone crazy. The phone is constantly disconnecting and (usually) reconnecting to the headset. Sometimes, it doesn't reconnect and I have to do it manually. When I am connected on a call, there is often static on the line. Of course in this case, the phone is only a couple of feet from the headset, both on the same side of my body. Why do I have these problems when the two devices are so close, when I can separate them by 20 feet indoors without the same problem? I'm confounded by this. In some circumstances, as mentioned earlier, the headset can be very good. For what I needed it to do, its been a failure. So, its getting returned.",neutral

"This came broken out of the bag. Both channels were really quiet and the sound came out mono. After sending back this defective part twice, I received a third broken one. Each of these parts were mislabeled with an incorrect serial number. Clearly the manufacturer in the China cannot read schematics and has some major QA issues. I can't imagine Motorola making a part this bad.. perhaps its a fake.",negative
"I was very pleased with the ease of installation and the amazing difference in reception that this product provided. I have a basement office (3 sides' concrete wall) in a three storey home with excellent reception upstairs but very poor downstairs. I mounted the antenna to the back of a buffet upstairs and connected it to an existing RG6 CATV cable from my home network system. I then connected the repeater to the other end of the cable in the basement at the home network system panel, plugged in the unit, and presto; I was up and running with great reception and no more missing or dropping those important calls. The unit comes with everything necessary (including 35' of RG6 cable) and EZ to follow instructions.",positive

I searched extensively for a holster for my Galaxy III phone that would fit on my 2 inch duty belt. This fits vertical or horizontal on the belt no problem. The phone has protective case that make it thicker and wider and it fit a little snug and the flap did close fine. The elastic side made it ideal for my phone with the case. The construction is somewhat light duty especially the metal clip attachment. The clip rivets are starting to tear and fray from constant putting on and off the belt on the second holster. For the price it is worth it and got two and have used them for a month. I high recommend this unit for persons who need a holster for a galaxy 3 phone and need it to fit on a 2 inch duty belt like law enforcement and security.,positive
"All I can say is that this devices is too fragile for everyday use. The earbuds glue gives out over time and you must purchase replacements. But worse, the ear loop that holds it in your ear, bend very easily and the slightest twist in your pocket will snap it in half. These cannot be replaced outside of the warranty period. Now for the function of the device, I have yet to have it work as advertised. Most people on the other end complain that the sound quality is horrible either with or without the sound cancellation. Great marketing gimmick, but does not work. Save you money and look for a better, long-lasting product!",negative

"I bought this phone thinking I would not mind the simplicity, seeing as all I ever use my phone for is calls, texting, and an alarm....However, after the first 10 mins of trying to set it up I was so annoyed that I decided to buy another phone. The display of the characters is so large, scrolling through your phonebook and text messaging/reading is impossibly annoying. Added to this, the navigation is extremely cumbersome due to it's primitive screen. Waste of money for me. This phone makes calls. Do not expect it to be very useful for anything else.",negative

"It serves it's purpose, but I guess it could have been better. here are my pros and cons Pros: While driving, it's better than holding in your hand to see the map and/or whose calling,...etc. Some parts are well made (but not all). I would have given 5 stars if it wasn't for these Cons: It shakes too much when you are driving. To release iphone, you have squeeze the sides and press the button in the back. Flimsy design to be used in horizontal position. there is no locking mechanism, so if you are turning or go over a bump, it may slip out. Update 11/30/2010 3 * to 1*. I tossed it in to garbage for the cons I mentioned in my original review.",negative
"This phone is really cool and has tons of features, but is missing basic features like; easy and quick way of setting the phone on vibrate, ring tones are extremely low and short, there is no way of adding categories or customizing them to your contacts, etc. Update: This phone ended up dying after four months of use. There was no support or replacements available. This is the best example of caveat emptor (buyer beware) that I can think of...

"THE SHORT: WARNING: IT'S NOT DESIGNED TO FIT iPhone. It will scratch the edges of iPhone when sliding into place. And if you have a protective cover on, it won't fit at all. Also, the adjustable wings are difficult to select the right sizes for your devices. Either too tight or too loose. When too loose, your device will rattle or bounce out of the cradle. THE LONG: I bought this piece in an attempt to update the current setup of Bracketron in my Audi A4 which I put together before the existence of iPhones. My setup consist of the Custom Bezel Mount (CBM), the Ultra-Slim Swivel, and the PHM-201PB. The PHM-201PB basically consists of the PH-Mini4 (the device holder) and the AMPs adapter (the T-notch adapter). With the exception of the the PH-Mini4 cradle, everything else from Bracketron is top-rate! Very well thought out design, easy to install, good quality, and very versatile. The T-notch adapter and the swivels works wonderfully. I would have rate these at 4.5 stars easily. Now, here's my complaints on the IPM-202BL (the reviewed item here): (1) It consist of the same PH-Mini4 that predates iPhone. No updates was done other than repackaging and re-part numbering. (2) It's false-marketed to fit iPhone. It really doesn't. It'll scratch the iPhone. (3) The Bracketron part numbering is rather confusing. If I'd known the same PH-Mini4 is part of the package. I wouldn't have bought it. So now, I'm stuck with two unwanted PH-Mini4.... returning it is too much trouble....",negative
"The case fits the RAZR perfectly and offers good protection. The belt clip was very tight and difficult to get on and off my belt or to adjust to a comfortable position when getting into my vehicle.

A loose loop would have worked much better than the tight spring steel clip. Fortunately, the case protected the phone from damage when the clip gave way.",neutral

"Well, this covering looks nice, and it helps keep fingerprints off the case, but that's about it. As you can see from the photo, it does not cover the screen or the keypad. Initially I thought that was a good thing because I want to see those things - right? Well when the phone is not in use, you want the screen to be fully covered to protect it from things. Also, the keypad gets grungy pretty quickly in pockets and purses, and it's hard to dust off, so it's good to have that covered as well. My other issue with this case is that after a few weeks, it started to tear at a weak spot. You see how it's got all the little openings cut out so you can get to the various buttons and stuff? That leaves a few spots where the silicon is very very thin, and apparently it's easy for it to start to tear. My advice is to get a leather case, the sort that flips closed over the phone. Yes it's a bit more hassle to open it and use the phone, but it really does protect the phone more than this type of case does.",negative

"This phone was great, with good functionability, wifi, music player, organizer, and all that, until it broke. after about two months, the LCD screen cracked, simply in my pocket in the car. i didn't drop it or anything, yet the LCD cracks, cant use the phone anymore. So i take it to the store, and this is apparently my fault, so no manufactor's warranty. They tell me to call a phone repair company in my area to have it replaced. I look online and find that many other people have had this same problem, as the LCD's on this phone are very thin and can crack with the smallest ammount of pressure. That repair company says they are sold out of the screens now, as they have sold 50 replacements in the past 3 weeks. I didn't know that t-mo sold that many dashes in the area every three weeks. So i can wait around for the replacement LCD's to be restocked, then pay 150 for the same thin delicate screen. Sorry, but i would never buy this again, seeing as i am sure that it will break again, and i will be completely out of luck, again. I don't know the specifics, but the t-mo extended warranty has a deductable on top of the initial payment, so that isn't even a practiucle solution, in my opinion.",negative

"I purchased this product because of its convenience and price ($50). The convenience of having a truly hands-free communication device is wonderful until it breaks. It is even less convenient when it breaks 3 times. After 2 months of using the product, the plastic hinges cracked. Then a piece of the plastic hinge broke off, now exposing any internal parts to dirt, rain, etc,. which happened to mine. The first time it quit was on a rainy day when (this is my guess as to what happened) a drop of rain affected the microphone in which I could hear others, but they could not hear me. I called Motorola for a Return Authorization, spent $5 to send it FedEx Ground to the company and in 2-3 weeks I received a new one. After not having this convenience product for a few weeks, I used it and a crack appeared on the microphone portion within 3-4 weeks. The rubber portion around the earpiece began to detach itself. The product was still working so I kept using it. Then the hinges went as it did before. Although it was working, I called Motorola to find out why they've made such a poor quality product for which the retail value is around $100? Their response included a Return Authorization, so for another $5 I sent it in again and was inconvenienced for another 2-3 weeks. It's been about two months since I've had my 3rd earpiece and the hinges cracked and now exposed its insides. Today the microphone earpiece began cracking. But it still works! Not well, but it works! So please read others reviews about earpieces and its durability before purchasing as the HS810 is a wonderful product if it were to last longer than at least 6 months.",negative

"I previously owned a 3650 (with the round keypad) so I have been very used to typing on a very small keypad. I just love this phone... The major reason that the keys are small is because the phone is small. The keypad and screen are interconnected and slide into the metal body of the phone (which is smaller than other slider phones I have seen like the Samsung). The screen is like a HD TV producing something like 275,000 colors. I have a Bluetooth connection through my laptop and after installing the Nokia CD ROM onto my computer and linking the two together (which was very easy) I sent one of my favorite photos to the phone, setting it as my wallpaper which is gorgeous. The software lets you send music and backup phone numbers and data from your phone to computer and visa versa. The call quality is exceptional, and the WAP internet is very fast. The 8801 also has some type of 3D engine built into the OS, which helps to produce amazing imaging. Battery life is somewhat less than I am used to, however, after letting the battery drain dead and then recharging for 24 hrs. (using the backup provided rotationally) I have actually been getting 3 hrs of talk time as suggested. One last thing that I love about the phone aside from that fact that it looks amazing and the OS is very easy to navigate (as are all Nokia's) is that the phones SAR's rating for tissue radiation from a cellular device is one of the lowest of any phone at .45 which is personally important to me (the federal limit is a little under 2).

A bit on the annoying side, but all in all, it does what it says and I can usually go a full 24 hours without having to worry about battery life",neutral

"Voice quality is very good. It can be finicky, as the bluetooth linkup connection time and quality varies depending on your phone. It's a gamble, but most phones work. It is a bit irritating that it generates a synthetic dial tone and alert beeps that are very loud, and you have to punch in a code to dial out of whatever phone you want to use. You wind up playing handset shuffle if you answer the cell phone, and try to turn off the bluetooth link. Slightly complicated, but not bad.",neutral

"I struggled about whether to grade it as a 2 or 3 star. Initially worked better than it does now. The ""DT"" stands for desktop if you haven't researched it thoroughly. This means you basically have to sit in front of it (maybe up to 10 or 12 feet AT MOST) for it to do its job. That was the case in year one, now in years 2 - 3, we have to sit within about 4 - 6 feet of it to be of any help. Also be aware that it is not capable of boosting a 4G signal; only up to 3G. I haven't seen any noticeable improvement in my smart phone's internet, which uses 3G and/or 4G signals.",neutral

"I've had this phone for about two months now and have only two complaints: average to good call clarity (I'd prefer excellent) and a crappy OS. Call clarity is acceptable to good and volume is great. Battery life is average for a phone with this sort of feature set. It needs daily charging if you use it a lot. Only major complaint: The operating system blows. I've had a longstanding allegiance to Nokia phones, which has only grown since switching to Motorola and realizing that the Nokia OS is often sensible where Motorola's is cumbersome. But I didn't like any of the new Nokia offerings and decided to give Moto a try. Moto OS is to Nokia OS as Windows 3.1 is to Mac OS X Tiger, which is to say I won't buy another Motorola if I can find a phone by another company that isn't ugly, has good call quality and decent battery life, and has the features I need or want. Bluetooth works great. Expandable storage is lovely to have (though getting that little card out is a pain). Camera is top notch for a cell phone. FYI: Purchased it locked from T-mobile but successfully unlocked it when I recently switched to ATT (Bought the code off Ebay).",positive

"The reason I bought the new trent charging device is because of the inability to typically charge my device while at work. I am an airline pilot and use my phone quite a bit to call operations and dispatch as well as the internet to check weather and gate status and anything else that is pertinent. Often times as the day gets extended due to weather I find myself with a dead phone near the end of the day and no way to communicate easily. In the plane there is no way to charge the phone so I needed a solution which is why I bought the New Trent device. 1. Devices charged with power pack: I charge a dell streak cell phone and occasionally an ipod touch. I recently bought an ipad but I have not used the new trent for the ipad yet although I am confident it is easily up to the task. 2. Number of charge cycles my power pack supplies: Since I only use this as an ""as needed"" charger I have charged my phone completely from zero to 100% two times. In addition to that I have plugged it in to charge my phone back up enough to continue its use. That has been probably 5 times or so. I have also charged my ipod touch from zero to 100% one time. 3. Frequency of usage: As mentioned it is an as needed basis when I find my phone is dying or has already died. It is not my primary charger for my phone but more a back up. I find that I use it maybe one time per trip at work which works out to maybe once per week or maybe a little less. The charger is the primary charger for the ipod touch. I use the ipod touch to record my flight times for my personal records and it sits in my flight case and when it dies the new trent brings it back to life. I find that I am able to rely much more on the new trent as I have used it and gained confidence. 4. Overall satisfaction with the product: Overall I am very satisfied with the product. One thing that I failed to mention above which is most impressive to me is the lack of charging that the new trent seems to need. When I bought it I charged it completely on the first day. I have since used it over the last few months to complete the charges mentioned above and the new trent still shows greater than 50% charge without having been recharged. This is a huge asset to me since I can simply leave it in my bag and not worry about. The product would be useless to me if I needed to worry about it being charged as much as my phone. I simply reach into my bag and grab it and know its ready to go. I am to the point where I am going to charge it just for the heck of it since I don't want to forget about it as it appears to never need charging. Granted I only use it as an emergency back up but I am still very impressed. Another thing to add is that out of the box it can NOT charge a dell streak. I do not hold this against the device but more against dell. Dell has a very unique charger on their streak and although it has a USB end it simply is not plug and play. When you plug the USB into the new trent it will do nothing. After some research on a dell streak forum I was able to get it all going. I bought a 4"" USB extension online and followed the instructions per the forum. This got the new trent charging my device perfectly. This is not a negative against this product at all. They provide a nice array of choices for charging heads and dell streak is very unique in their charging situation and I could not expect them to cater to that one device.",positive
"This headset is without a doubt partly a piece of jewelry. It looks great, feels great, and works, well, just ok. You see, I suppose it depends what you want from a headset. Now, some people complain about the quality of the item, saying that this and that are plastic and such. This is a headset, it should without a doubt, be made of plastic for weight purposes. The headset sounds great, works well, is VERY comfortable, range is just so-so, but here is the simple problem with the product: It doesn't work well (basically, it doesn't work at all) with wind. Even tiny gusts of wind make my voice almost inaudible to the other caller. I can hear them very well, but this is just unacceptable for one of the most expensive on the market. I am going to test the plantronics 510 next, hopefully with better results. If I don't get what I am looking for, Samsung WEP 200, here I come. If I want mediocre performance, I will go with the smallest of the bunch.",neutral

"Like others have posted, fit is an issue. For the Noise Assassin feature to work, the device must be in contact with your face.

Does not really live up to the hype, and is overpriced in my opinion.",neutral
"I bought this booster for my camper when I stay in the woods at some distance from cell towers. In the particular area I am staying, you can just occasionally get a received call through but it usually gets dropped quickly. So I set up this booster with the boosted signal antenna inside the camper as recommended. But the only way to get a call through is to hold the phone inches away from the inside antenna. And even then if I move away just slightly, sometimes the call gets dropped. So I called the help line from Wilson and told them of my problem. And they told me that if there was a weak signal outside, then the signal would be weak inside. If that is true, I wonder about the claims that it will boost the signal by six times. And they told me the only way to fix that is to buy a bigger antenna or put this one higher. So I am not happy with this booster, but kept it because if I faithfully hug the inside antenna, at least I can get a call in and out.",neutral
I bought this phone for my daughter who was leaving for Poland for 6 weeks.

"I absolutely LOVE this device! I found it at the California State Fair in the marketplace of exhibits. The booth had several of these set up at the foot of chairs and the people running the booth called me over to have a seat. What attracted me was the fact I did not have to take my shoes off. I placed my feet on the device and then the attendant placed another massager on top of my feet to really sandwich the massage in place. I IMMEDIATELY felt relieved. I wanted it on the high setting and once there, I could just feel it melting away all the achy tiredness my feet were feeling from walking around the fairgrounds all day. It is like those FOOTSIE-WOOTSIE chairs you see at big events that cost .25 cents a minute. After sitting in the chair for several minutes, that is when they broke out the price. It was a little more than I expected, cost wise, but I had already been sold, so it was difficult to say NO. However, I did not have the money at the time and kept a mental note that I was going to eventually get this massager. After a few months of saving up, I decided to purchase it and it was very easy to do using Amazon. Hence why I am writing this review. The entire experience was pleasurable, I would do it all over again, and I would definitely recommend this to a friend.",positive

"As far as clarity goes it does a decent job. It has some cool features worth note. You can dial and answer with your voice. It loads all your contacts as well which is also cool. The bummer thing is that if you have two phones it has to do this with each new phone. Iphone has over four hundred contacts, work phone not as many. I ended up just not using it for work because I didn't want to go through and add four hundred contacts each time I switched, which was everyday. It is hard to get away from the tin can sound using bluetooth but BlueAnt does a credible job. The nagging thing is that the volume from the caller is not loud enough to cover engine and exterior noise levels. You will find yourself putting your ear up to your visor to make out what they are saying. Sometimes you will pick it up and talk into it which truly seems to defeat the purpose. Ultimately I don't use it anymore for these reasons. I will likely get one that will port it through my stereo speakers. If it had that one function I could likely rate it higher. As it stands it is a solid 3 stars. You could do worse, but something tells me there is better out there. I'm hopeful that BlueAnt 4 makes some of these changes.",neutral

"The picture make it look as though it has a leather or solid black front. In fact, the front is clear plastic. I didn't expect much, for the price, but in order to make it work I have to put the phone in the holder backwards. The reason for this is that the front of the phone is smooth, so when you put the phone in the proper way the smooth surface sticks to the plastic making it almost impossible to get the phone out of the holder by the time the phone stops ringing. The back of my phone is more textured, not smooth, so the plastic doesn't stick to it. However, it does do the job, just not what I expected.",neutral

"Anakin's Episode 3 saber is by far one of the better and more advanced versions Master Replica could ever come up with. While other units used Floursent tubes and poor sound quality, the new Episode 3 saber uses 60+ Rowed LED lights which give a realistic Up and Down power motion. The blade's color and brightness has also increased by nearly 20% compared to Episode 2 styles. The sensors have been tuned so it doesn't make the swung noise as easily unless swung unlike Vader's Episode 5 saber. Also the battle clashing sounds have been improved. Unlike other models, Anakin's Episode 3 has atleast 3 different battle clashes which feel more realistic. Everything from a burning clash down too a quick jolt against another saber. The hilt/handle is a chrome coated diecast metal with rubber grips for easy gripping. The power on/off switch is comfortably located near your thumb if positioned correctly and must be firmly pressed to turn on or off so you won't do something by accident like turning it off during some minor play time. While Master Replica has stated that dueling with other MR sabers is okay but not recommended, I also agree. However I have seen these bashed around a few times from hard core collectors and nothing bad will really occur unless you go all out violent with these. The blades are incased in a durable hard plastic coating over the strobe LED lights. But still, I recommend moderate dueling with caution, don't swing these around as hard as you would as HASBRO toy. Master Replica has really outdone themselves and continue to do so in the future with other Light Saber releases for 2006.",positive

I have already told several friends and associates about it and many of them have already bought one for themselves. I was dubious about the claim of 2.5 Watt-Hours total power on the spec sheet but this does appear to be true, and this makes the mini at least twice as powerful as other OEMs' units, and in many cases more than 4 times as powerful. This tells me they are using a high quality battery inside. This is a great product.",positive

I have not had a single call yet where the person on the other end had trouble hearing me. You also hear them extremely well thanks to the padded headphone that cups your ear and keeps out other noise. This thing works great in a noisy semi truck, so I know it would be awesome in other, quieter settings!",positive
"Works better some days than others. Seems like putting external antenna in the attic is not getting the amount of signal needed to boost it through the house via the internal antenna and amplifier. It does bring the signal in to different levels of the house, but does result in poor voice quality at times.

When it gets warmer outside I will try bringing the external antenna out abobe the roofline and see if that helps.",neutral
"I was a bit nervous when I ordered this case since there were no reviews. Cimo had a similar hybrid with frost clear back. Supcase had a similar product too, but the back was clear. So I took a chance. This is a very attractive case on the One. The black trim on Silver back provides a nice contrast. There are cutouts for everything except the volume buttons. I tested the volume buttons first since some cases make it difficult to press the buttons. No so with this case. Very easy to press. The cutout for the rear facing mic leaves plenty of room between the mic and cutout (the mic is perfectly centered within the cutout). The bottom mic is a bit off-center within the bottom cutout, but it's far enough from the material. Cutouts for LED and rear facing camera match the pics that accompany the product description. Cutouts for power/IR and headphone jack are centered. Case is very snug (I like that). Bumper provides a nice grip since it is textured. There is a good sized lip on the case that will protect the screen when placed faced down on a flat surface. Once concern with other brands is that the hard material sometimes separates from the TPU material. I'll update the review in a few months after I use this case for awhile. This case replaces a Cruzerlite Bugdroid Circuit ""Clear"" case... mainly because the Cruzerlite's idea of ""clear"" is actually frosted white. And it cost $12.90. Overall, this BoxWave is great case for $5.70 that was Prime eligible. ******************* UPDATE: 2013-09-28 ******************* I bought 2 of these cases since we have 2 HTC Ones in the family. My case is still great. My daughters case, on the other hand, has not fared as well. The rubber bumper has separated almost completely from the hard case after 2 months of use.

"Hello People. Here is an honest review for those who are looking for a good headset. I purchased the Voyager 510 over two years ago to go with my Katana phone. The problem I was having with the 510 was that the signal would drop a lot, so much that I called Plantronic and they told me that the Katana was not compatible with the 510. However, they're customer service was excellent. They told me that cell phones control headset, headsets don't control phones. Cell phones send out signals and headsets pick up the signal. But to make sure I didn't have a defected headset, they sent me a new 510 hoping that will solve the problem. However it didn't. So I was convinced that it was the headset, not my Katana. My wife and I decided to upgrade our phones, so I purchased the Samsung Instinct and I wanted a Bluetooth headset that would work with my new phone, since I was convinced that the 510 was not a good headset. So I purchased the Plantronic Discovery 925. I really was excited when I received the 925. However, here are my Pros and Cons of the 925: Pros: 1. It looked great and its small size was great compared to my 510. 2. The recharging case was a neat feature. 3. One button controlled everything. Cons: 1. It was the most uncomfortable headset I ever wore; so much that it hurt my ear. 2. The sound was not very loud compared to my 510. 3. The recharging case was very difficult to place the headset in. Summary: I returned the 925. It just caused too much pain to my ear. In the meantime I continued to use my 510, which I notice was working pretty well, no drop calls with my new Instinct. Still not too sure about the 510, I purchased the Jawbone. Once again, I was really excited when I received the Jawbone. However, here are my Pros and Cons of the Jawbone: Pros: 1. It looked great and its small size was great compared to my 510. Cons: 1. It wasn't comfortable to wear. 2. The sound wasn't very loud. 3. The buttons are hard to find and the fit was very hard to achieve. Summary: I read several reviews and a lot of people recommended getting Jabra mini eargels and it would fit perfect. So I order the eargels. However, I said to myself, ""why should I pay an extra $10 to get a headset to work correctly. I already spent $90 on the headset. The eargels should have come with the headset."" So after I gave it some though, I returned the Jawbone. I wasn't impressed with the Jawbone at all. My 510 worked better than the Jawbone. At this point, I started to believe that it wasn't my 510 at all; it was the Katana, just like Plantronic customer service said, because my 510 is working great. However, since my 510 is over 2 years old, I'll try one last headset and use the 510 as a backup headset. So I purchased the Voyager 520, which was supposed to be an upgrade to the 510. However, here are my Pros and Cons of the 520: Pro: 1. The 520 is the most comfortable headset I ever wore. 2. One button controls everything Cons: 1. You must keep the headset close to the phone. It says you can go 33 feet away from your phone using this headset, but that's not true. It's more like 9 feet and I'm being generous with the 9 feet. With my 510, I can go a long distance and the signal is still strong. 2. Not very loud compared to my 510. 3. There is a lot of static compare to my 510. Summary: Needless to say, I was very disappointed with the 520 and returned it. Conclusion: I must say out of all these headsets, my Plantronic Voyager 510 worked best and out performed all of these for my needs. I'm not saying the rest of these headset are not good headsets. However, for my needs, none of these headset are better than my 510. The 510 has to be one of the best headsets ever made and I would recommend it to anyone. Just make sure your phone is compatible with it. And yes, the 925, Jawbone and 520 all are compatible with my phone, but the 510 still out perform them all.",negative

"This is a great product at a good price--about half as much as the local wireless store. I work with wood on a lathe, which means I have wood shavings everywhere, including in my pockets. The otterbox does a fairly good job at keeping them out, but I definitely get some small pieces under the screen protector, which is a bummer. I have checked and re-checked the alignment for leaks, and it is perfect. The seal of the box around the phone is just not as tight as it should be. It doesn't close very securely, allowing a very small gap between the screen protector and the plastic shell, which lets dust through.

"Pros: Held the phone as advertised. Cons: 1. The release mechanism is hard to actuate. You have pull up on the release, while holding the belt clip down, you could then pull the phone up, opposite of other phone holders. 2. The knob that fits into the belt clip is in the center of the phone. When you take the phone off the clip it is near impossible to know what orientation the phone is, if it was towards the top it would be easier to know that the phone is upright or upside down. 3. The plastic that covers the phone is a trap for dirt and requires a regular cleaning. 4. When the phone is opened the case can slide on the phone, it usually slid up and covered the ear speaker, making it hard to hear.

"First of all, I'm really really jealous of those of you who said their signal jump from 1 or 2 bars to 5 bars. I live in a condo so I have to mount the antenna on the inside where I got around 3 bars in that area. Even with the green steady lights on the booster with gain set at the max. The signal only jumps may be a bar up and down depending on my movement. I really want it to work, but at this price. I think it's going back. Once my contract is up I'm switching from AT&T to Verizon. There's more Verizon towers than AT&T in my area anyway according to the towers locator app. Got 5 bars on my old Verizon flip phone when I fire it up to test it.",negative

Is there a way to sync using this kit? Thanks for any feedback!"" It took me a while to find this out. To hotsync using a cable that does not have a button on it, look for the Hotsync icon on the Treo 600 screen, select it, and when the Hotsync program opens on the Treo, tap the large Hotsync icon in the centre of the screen. This doesn't seem to be documented in the Treo manual.",neutral
"This was my very first bluetooth headset. I love it. I have it paired with a Nokia E71 and use it constantly. The pairing was very easy with the phone and all the buttons on the headset integrate into the functions of the phone. Functions such as Answer, Hangup, Volume, Skip Song Track, Previous Song Track, Pause Song, and Voice Commands are right at your fingertips. You don't have to take your phone out of your pocket! PROS: It's size, battery life, and function are awesome. Wireless headphones that slide into your pocket and allow you to answer the phone! Pretty awesome! Great price. Has a nice carry case to keep everything together. CONS: The headset fits my ear best when it is in headset mode. In headphone mode, it is a little looser in my ears and sometimes becomes loose. Sometimes the reception between my phone and the headset gets broken up. Doesn't happen often, but I think this is a typical problem with any wireless technology. Sound isn't as good as a high-quality headphone, but what do you expect from a $50 wireless device? I love this headset so much that I'll buy another when this breaks.",positive
I give this product 3 stars. It is a good product but if you are using it in a rough work area over time it does not hold up lasted about 4 months. For just everyday use I think it would last a lot longer.,neutral

"The Jabra BT125 is a pretty good headset but the damn thing blinks all the time and drives me crazy. The blinking is distracting to everyone around me and very distracting to me when it is dark (rooms or nights). That blue light bounces off of everything. I look like some kind of a lighthouse. Who ever thought that it has to blink, for whatever reason they had for the blinking blink, they obviously didn't think that I would have pull it off to check it(at least in the light). Other than that it works OK.",neutral
"MARCH 2017 UPDATE - I see they dropped the price so some may think 18 months of use is ok. For myself, about 6 months ago (less than 18 months) the right speaker went out. Pfft! I tolerated since I just do calls/podcasts that don't require stereo. Now it just cuts in and out. Verified with another headset that it's not my iPhone 5 (looking to upgrade soon!). To my mind, a solid state device that only sits around my neck and has this much space for quality innards should last a decade. My old Sony wired headset speakers lasted that long. The solidly-constructed bud-wires beat out the LG Tone, but that's not saying much in my book. APRIL 2015 - I had an LG Tone I really liked, but the build quality of the wires to the earbuds cracked and severed in less than a year! Doesn't seem to have been fixed in later models, so I put replacing on hold for the past year. Came across these from Motorola and they looked good. I've had good experiences with Motorola products in the past and I liked the explicit mention of the earbud wires being ""linguine"" and that they use magnets to hold the earbuds to the neckset. So I ordered. Having had them a couple days, here's what I have to say. First the neckset is much stiffer and narrower than the Tone. Fine for me, but definitely going to be a problem for many. Because of the stiffness, they're more difficult to remove from the neck than the Tone. Also, no vibration when a call comes in, unlike the Tone. If you haven't an earbud in your ear, you might miss a call. Pairing was easy with my iPhone 5. Not so easy was pressing the Call button (looks like the pic in the manual is reversed) to summon Siri. At first, doing that resulted in playing music from my iPhone and I had a hard time getting that to stop. Seem to have worked it out now. The audio for music is pretty good. The USB charge cord is super short. If you have the earbuds in, you do hear some odd sounds sometimes. In terms of wearability and style and maybe even the sound, I'll give the edge to LG Tone, but LG Tone is no good if you spend that much for a headset that doesn't make it through at least a year. I feel pretty confident, though it's early days of course, that this Motorola stereo Bluetooth is going to give me at least a couple years of service. Fingers crossed. Cheers!",negative

"Cons: Sluggish. Hangs every now and then. Video (movies) does not play for more than 10-15 min after that the sound comes but the screen freeze. Even after Xenon flash indoor shoots are hazy. The hands free is weird, it has a button to disconnect but it does not redial the last number. Also the disconnect button location inadvertently disconnects the call in the middle of conversation. Pros: Almost everything in a phone. GPS works fine, only time to first connect is long but after that it quickly links and works fine. WLAN connects faster. Camera for all cell phone standard is extremely good, I used it on a trip and I am happy with the results. Speakers are good quality Overall I would recommend this phone but keep in mind that it won't do things as fast as you would like it to perform. Forget about watching video as they play only for 10-15 min. To browse web, you wold need to update the flash player and I don't know how to update only the flash player, I updated the software from the Nokia website but haven't tried internet after that.",neutral

This product is fantastic. Super easy to set up with your phone's contacts and mount. Have had it for 3 weeks and has not needed to be recharged. Leave my phone's bluetooth on all the time. It will disconnect when I'm out of the car and reconnect when I get in. It also announces that you are connected. Clear speaker and noise filtering microphone. I drive a noisy Jeep Wrangler and can hear it just fine. The American english voice sounds like a robot. Use the English english voice. Much nicer and kind of sexy.,positive
"Purchased this phone for my wife, but it does not work well with the handsfree system in her Lexus. She can make calls, but the phone will not Ring through the vehicle's audio system, display signal strength or battery level on the car's display. I looked on the Lexus web site and it looks like none of the LG phones will ring through the vehicle's audio system. She rarely can hear it ring when she is driving. The only way she knows a call is coming in is the car's display changes from ""map"" to ""phone"". Other issue is the address book on the phone. If you have more than one phone number for a contact it is difficult to get to the screen that allows you to select which number you want to call.

"My first GPS as I've been waiting for the prices to come down. The Nuvi 200 doesn't have all the features of higher priced models(MP3 player, bluetooth, etc.) but it does its job of navigation just as well as the higher priced models in the Garmin line. At first I thought I really needed to have the text to voice option(the actual street name spoken vs. just turn left)which this model does not have. In reality it's not a big deal as the top of the screen shows you the name of the upcoming turn in large letters...so just a glance to the screen can quickly confirm the street/route name if indeed you really need to see it. Size of unit is perfect, easily slips into pocket, yet no problem with entering destination on touch screen. Volume is loud enough to play radio with decent volume and still hear the Garmin's cues. Screen brightness is very good and battery life(should you decide to not use the supplied plug into your lighter outlet) is very good. I charge the unit with a USB cable from my computer as there is no supplied AC power adapter on this model. Unit charges up quickly with USB cable. Of course you can just plug it into your car's lighter power outlet and your good to go. Only disappointment so far has been that some addresses do not show up on the updated maps(latest 2008 version shipped with my Nuvi)...such as Retirement community in a small town that's been there for almost 5 years, therefore the reason for 4 stars vs. 5 star rating.",positive

"First, this is a great headset. Second, Bluetooth is horrible technology. The truth is that the headset is great but your experience depends on your phone.

The sound is good and the volume is really loud. Now that being said, if I use a headset made by Motorola with my phone I have lots of problem. I have tried 4 different headsets and I always have problem with static, etc. In the end my experience is that it depends on your phone/headset combination. Trust me I have had many phones and headsets. This is a good headset regardless of the cheap price. The best part is the plastic piece fits in my ear canal, which makes it a lot easier to hear the other person. The only negative is this headset picks up a lot of extra noise. Its not bad but people will be able to tell if you are in the car or not. But you know, ALL headsets are like that.",positive

"Nice phone, especially the automatic voice feature that does not need training... works right away ... My complaints are in 2 areas detailed below. First for those who want to transfer contacts from another phone, PDA or from Outlook. And second that Verizon has had LG remove file transfer features that forces user to pay for MIDIs and MP3 that are already on your PC, just to use up your air time (= money!) 1. The Manual mentions a USB cable once. 2. LG's website mentions no such device, nor drivers, for any CDMA phone. Search engine produces no results. 3rd party cable exists but advertises 'no drivers, no software' 3. No infrared, no bluetooth (of course not for the price) 4. Can send but NOT receive text message / MMS in which you include addresses from your competitive phone. (This feature exists in Nokia, Siemens, even the oldest black/white Nokias!) 5. Has neat music tunes (polyphone MIDIs) that you can ONLY send to others, but not set as ringtones. I guess you may send it to yourself, and charge yourself for airtime!! Is that extortion? Conclusion: A. camera and hot pix are features that encourage you to share wirelessly and consume airtime for Verizon's profits. B. This may reveal a deeper strategy of Verizon and LG to remove technology to force user to spend needlessly C. Suggest ""googling"" (or searc CNET) to corroborate other rumors that Verizon makes use use airtime for reading text message and partially disables bluetooth for file management to force you to pay for data transfers. D. With Nokia, Siemens and others you can transfer WAV, MIDIs, and MP4 files from your PC for ringtones via an accessory cable, or if enabled, via Infrared and/or Bluetooth, and MMS. There may be a removable multimedia card feature on LG's 8100 or later phones that MAY enable some of these features, but I hope this helps avoid the wasted moves I had to make.",negative

It does what it is advertised to do, but my experience with it only produced marginal improvements. So why the 4+ star review? Well, if you're in an area where you have only 1 bar and you get an additional bar, that could mean the difference between a call staying connected and a dropped call. Also, the booster (I'm no electrical engineer) seems to smooth out the signal (so whatever bars you have are also more consistent (? Again, I'm no engineer). Other reviewers noted an increase in data speed, but that's something I have yet to notice. Though the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wilson-Electronics-Mobile-4G-Vehicle-Cellular-Signal-Booster-Kit-Retail-Packaging-Blue/dp/B00JG9O2P0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wilson Electronics Mobile 4G Vehicle Cellular Signal Booster Kit - Retail Packaging - Blue</a>&nbsp;is quite capable that capability comes with a price: it's cumbersome and large. Ergo, this unit. Installation is straight-forward and really quite simple: exterior antenna on roof (magnetic mount), antenna cable routed into car to booster cradle, DC adapter in power port, power cable to booster cradle. Finished. I do NOT like the provided 3M adhesive dash mount. Fortunately, the ball mount is compatible with other solutions such as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bracketron-SWM-400-BL-Low-Pro-Windshield-Mount-Black/dp/B00178RDZ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bracketron SWM-400-BL Low Pro Windshield Mount (Black)</a>&nbsp;(at least it is with an earlier model of this mount). As far as performance, I'm not sure I'm really seeing it. That's not because the booster isn't doing anything, it's more the result of my cell phone provider finally adding 4G to the nearest tower (and with the provider finally making good on the years-ago promise to get the part of the county I live in 4G covered). Had I tested this a few weeks back I would be able to report a more accurate result as I was definitely living in a 4G fringe area. So I'm going to have to wait a month or so until my next trip out to the ""boonies"" to see if this works as I expect it to. At this point, if it works as well as Wilson products have for me in the past, I pretty sure I won't be disappointed. At $200 it may seem a bit pricey, but for a business person, farmer, or builder (etc.) who depends on cell phone connectivity I think it's not too steep a price to pay.

Wilson manufactured the cradle up to its usual high standards and it looks good, so I'm very pleased there as well. The DC power adapter feels a bit cheesy, but that's really me being picky (btw, the DC adapter uses a non-standard USB cable to connect to the cradle which seems a bit strange, but it works). The adhesive tape dash mount option is not what I would choose to use, but is easily remedied (and probably with some items many of you already have from other installs). The antenna is a stubby one that attaches to the roof via magnet. If this is insufficient (e.g., you need more range) Wilson offers other antennas (such as their larger bumper- or mirror-mounted antennas). All in all, pretty happy. Sorry I can't provide more precise performance details. Other reviewers seem to be pleased with that aspect. As I mentioned, I'll update this review if the results I get next month are different (better or worse) than I anticipate them to be. In the end, I think this is a solid piece of equipment from a reputable manufacturer of quality electronics.",positive

"Pros: This is a handy little charger and works as advertised. It's sleek, and comes with a little bag, which is great to throw in your carry-on, purse or briefcase. I did a test so I could know its capacity when I travel. I charged the unit for 6 hours to a full charge, and found that it would could charge my totally drained ipad 3 up to about 60% full. This will definitely be enough for any of my international flights and extended car trips. It also works great with my iphone. Cons: 1. The included instructions are not well-written, and I think that is the problem with some of the bad reviews -- they can't figure out how to use it. When you want to charge your iphone/ipad, you have to connect your apple cable into the female receptor of the little short black cable that then connects to the charger. If you plug the apple cable directly into the charger, then it doesn't charge. 2. Also, one weird thing -- while it was charging my ipad, the ipad gives a message saying ""not charging"". However, it actually did charge the whole time while it had that message. That definitely should be fixed, or they will get a lot of returns.",positive
"While I like the fact that this case allows me to see the external display on my V60, the rest of the desig is almost as bad as the clip that originally came with the phone. The clip on the case is the same as the standard motorola pager clip, therefore making it difficult to get it on and off of your belt to answer a call or see who is calling. The clip is also so thick that the case itself is thicker than the original phone even without the phone in the case! It also will not fit in the desktop charger with the case on the phone and due to the design on the case you have to completely remove it to make it fit. I have actually reverted to using the horrible original clip as I didn't like this big bulky thing on my hip. Here's hoping BodyGlove comes out with a V60 case soon.....",negative

Secondly, despite advertising it as ""new"" the screen is pixelated and you can't really see the time on the top flap. Thirdly, phone conversations are very poor and fuzzy. It has nothing to do with my plan, carrier, or reception, it simply picks up poorly and every fourth word is indistinguishable. the nice thing is the camera though which works amazingly, I really like that.",neutral

"Unfortunately the cable did not work for my LG Shine model CU720, it caused a power surge on my computer's USB port when the phone was connected. I'd strongly suspect, given all the positive reviews here, that it's simply a defective cable and not a design fault. But more unfortunately, the seller refused to reimburse return shipping on their defective cable, and the shipping cost is more that the item price. So I'll just have to toss it. Fortunately I immediately located an OEM cable right here on Amazon that cost only slightly more and works perfectly. I received it in just a couple of days, too. So I'd urge anyone who needs a cable fast and without drama to get the genuine item and not the cheap generic.",negative

"It might be worth the risk for you since it's so cheap, but don't buy it expecting it to work. Problems: It came factory sealed and broken... the sticky mounting arm bracket had been shoved through it's clips as if it had had something very heavy dropped on it. This also speaks to the cheapness of the plastic. The vent mount (which is why I bought it and soldiered on) doesn't comfortably fit any car I've tried it in. It can technically be mounted in my GF's car, but not with the support brace so it would be wobbly. It barely holds an iPhone 4 with no case, you have to clamp it down hard, and if you angle it just right could probably plug in a charging cable (if you need one). But it does technically hold it well enough. You will have to release the clamp (spring loaded button) and re-clamp it (just squeeze) every time you use it. It does NOT hold a 3GS or a first gen at all. The bottom brace is too small and the curved designs on those models make them just slide off. It does NOT fit a 3GS with a case on it. My GF uses a very thin back shell and at maximum width it can be crammed in but just barely, and again, because of the curved phone design the base is too small and it still falls out. Basically if you get one that's not broken and have an un-cased iPhone 4, and plan to mount it with the arm it might work, and it's cheap enough you might want to try. If you want the vent mount don't expect it to fit. If you have an iPhone other than a 4, or use a thick case on a 4, don't expect it to fit. It's very cheaply made from brittle plastic (that you have to stress to set up...) so really keep your expectations in check.",negative

"This is a review for boost mobile (nextel's prepaid service). I have a company phone when I travel during the school year, so I wanted a cool prepaid phone. I had (still do) a Nokia 1220 (Tracfone) and that phone was good (very basic), but I only had service in my local area (Houston) and no where else. After getting stuck at Chicago O'Hare without cell service, I decided I needed a phone that would get service in all major areas of the USA. I have not been dissappointed!! The rates are VERY reasonable for prepaid ($.15 - $.25/minute), customer service has been WONDERFUL, and it has (almost) all the cool features I had on my Sprint vision phone. TM, internet and walkie talkie (to Nextel and Boost customers). I hope what I read in an earlier review is not right about them getting bought out by sprint, because I was with them for almost 6 years and the customer service and plans went VERY steadily downhill! If you need a REALLY COOL phone and do not want a monthly contract, consider Boost Mobile.",positive
"I got the Bodysuit and Tuxedo TPU cases. Both fit well on my phone -- easy to snap on and neither too loose nor too tight.

The cutout holes for charger cord, speaker, earphone jack etc are in the right place, and have adequate margin space around them. The power and volume buttons are covered but can still be easily pressed and you can feel where they are from the grooves. Case feels sturdy and firm though I haven't put it to the test/haven't dropped my phone yet (knock on wood). No complaints at all from me.",positive

"We bought this item about a year ago through Amazon. Having read the reviews, we installed the antenna inside the attic as high as it will go, and installed silvered insulation below it to isolate it from feedback that its own transmitter would produce. The RF cable supplied in the kit is 50 feet long, but although our house is 2 stories high there's no convenient way to run the cable to the first floor - so we couldn't locate the antenna 20 feet above the transmitter. Our house is located in a neighborhood that's notorious for poor cell reception. This booster increased the indicated signal on our cell phones from zero-to-1 bar up to 5 bars right next to the transmitter, but our joy was short-lived when we found that the performance of our phones wasn't increased all that much - the reception still isn't as clear as it is outside our neighborhead, and we still get too many dropped calls. The signal strength drops off rapidly elsewhere in the house; on average it's about 2 bars. We tried the e-mail tech support; the response was quick and accurate but it didn't make a silk purse of our sow's ear. They wanted a 20-foot separation between antenna and transmitter but that would require running exposed cable through a second-story room and that isn't an acceptable option for us. They also suggested using as short a cable as possible for maximum signal strength so we used a 25-foot cable but that hasn't had a noticeable effect. So the bottom line for us is that it does increase reception from almost-nonexistent to barely-there. It works, but is not worth $190 to us.",neutral

"This inexpensive little ""Switcheasy"" clip looked like a promising solution to holding the Nike plus sensor onto your shoe if, like me, you prefer running shoes other than Nikes with the built-in sensor pocket (I am a big fan of Asics Gel Kayanos). In fact, I bought two ""clear"" clips. I have a different pouch that laces onto my shoes, but it's hard to remove since you've got to unlace the shoe completely, so I thought this clip would give me an easy way to change between walking, running, hiking shoes etc. It IS very easy to switch. The problem is, it's too easy: it falls off. A lot. I read the directions and carefully tried to ""lock"" it onto my laces. But I lost two separate sensors...one while walking in my neighborhood and the other while on a cruise ship deck. I was always picking it up after it fell off around the house or on the street. I do walk a mile or two almost daily, but I'm hardly a ""power user""...I don't run much and I'm not hiking in the backwoods. THe clips are not expensive, but the Nike plus sensors in the sport kit or with the new Nike plus sportsband aren't cheap. It just doesn't make sense to use this clip and risk losing the sensor. The best choice: the velcro-driven Marware sportsuit sensor case, currently on Amazon at $9.99. Velcros right onto your shoe laces. Easy, secure. And no, I don't work for Marware. There is always some slight accuracy loss with all these clips, but they make so much sense because they allow flexibility with your workout shoe purchase AND what particular shoes you want to wear that day -- especially important if you wear waterproof/cleat walking shoes in the rain and ice.",negative

"Searching The Internet for details on Bluetooth wireless headsets with microphones, I ran across a ""You Tube"" Bluetooth Audio Radio Interface--a review by ""Randy,"" an amateur radio operator whose FCC Call Sign is K7AGE. Video and audio show how well it performs. K7AGE reveals how it sounds to other ham operators compared to his radio's regular microphone. I heard no difference. I ordered the B250 via Amazon as a result of K7AGE's demo. It came from an outside merchant, Payless Distributors, and was a smooth transaction with fast delivery. J&R Music World now has them, & my experience with J&R also is super. It goes back to the 1980s when I ordered a huge Sony console TV from them that arrived quickly and perfectly. I rate both merchants & Blueparrot with the top score whether your need is sophisticated, as in FM, AM and SSB communication used by hams; commercial application on two-way radios with PDs, SOs, fire departments, or for wireless connection to your cell phone. Handsfree may mean the difference between life & death. I've ""come close"" several times in my 40 years as a ham radio operator because it's dangerous to hold only one hand on the steering wheel, the other on a microphone, & divert attention from road to radio. Many states may outlaw mobile cell use that is not handsfree. That's probably a good idea.(Look up JABRA A-210 if your device has NO Bluetooth capability.) I rate both highly, and the K7AGE ""You Tube"" show allows you to see & hear it in action. I've not tried the Blueparrot on my Apple Iphone because it & my Dodge Magnum SRT-8 already have BT. If it works great through K7AGE's & my ham gear, too, there's no reason that it shouldn't be equal or better via cell. Blueparrot's most keen feature for the price is its ability to null background noise. That quality often is limited to expensive pro microphones, such as those made by Heil Sound, one of the top names. It's unique to find an inexpensive microphone-headset combo that performs this well, let alone one that also contains Bluetooth circuitry. It's even safer because it covers only one ear. It's the best bang for the Bluetooth buck & it's comfortable, too.",positive

"I will say that the most annoying part of a cell phone is the latency associated with navigating the menus, browsing the web, etc. My razr is so slow to go through menus, to cycle through contacts rapidly, browsing the web is a chore. I get so mad waiting for the phone to react even though it only takes a few extra seconds it will sometimes miss key strokes and is just painful to use when it is so delayed. The blackjack is not as bad as the razr and navigating the menus is pretty quick. There is occasional slow downs if memory is low and you try to do something that requires several menus to go by in rapid succession (for example ending a call and then quickly pulling up contacts to make a new call will take like 5 seconds). HOWEVER, web browsing on this clunker is very very slow. Even with 3G the latency is horrible. You can expect very slow responses when going through multiple pages/frames, etc. If you want to download large files, it goes very fast. If you want to browse the web as quickly as on a computer, the blackjack is no way going to make you happy and it is quite frustrating in the number of pages that have to be refreshed/reloaded in order to load since many times it hangs. Using the Gmail app to check my Inbox takes about 40 seconds from main screen to seeing new messages but the amount of data (3G or EDGE or GPRS) is very small, the phone just can't process the data fast enough and the network's latency (or the phone's networking latency) makes this a very slow process. This is due to the phone, not the 3G speeds. The phone just doesn't have the computing power to load web pages quickly and make browsing the web the same as on a computer with just a smaller screen. It also doesn't come with a flash player which makes many websites have problems. Also I live right in the middle of Philadelphia and sitting on my couch I go from having 3-4 bars of 3G to four bars of EDGE even though I haven't moved. The 3G coverage is not consistent and the phone seems to pick it up when it feels like it.",neutral

"Bought the White UniColor version of this and about 2 weeks with this case, the outer white section started getting dirty. Might try throwing the case in the dish washer this weekend to see if that cleans it, probably won't though. Other than the discoloration, the case is perfect.

I also don't have a SUPCASE logo on the back of mine covering the beataudio logo so I guess I got lucky on that. Other than the discoloration the case is great! Would buy again in a different color probably. UPDATE (9/14/2013): Here is an update to my review after using the WHITE UniColor Case. Unfortunately there is NO WAY to clean the dirt off this once it gets on the white rubber edge which is very disappointing as it looks wonderful, when new, with the phone. Another issue I have now is that the opaque back has separated from the white rubber surround in the bottom left corner of the case. All in all I can no longer recommend the White UniColor Case at this time until they fix the two problems (Discoloration/plastic separation).

"Well, I must say I am very disappointed. All the great reviews and I picked it based on that. The first one I got the side button did not work, Amazon quickly replaced it. The second one worked great for a few days then it started dropping the connection constantly. Then I had to keep pairing it, then it wouldn't go in to pairing mode even though the buttons seemed to be working. Two strikes and your out. I went back to my trusty Scala 500. The voice quality is not as good as the Plantronics but it works every time and keeps the connection. The Scala is not as comfortable as the Voyager either. I use Plantronics BT for my home office and it is great - don't know why I had these issues with this great headset. Maybe I will try one in a few months.",negative

If there is any noise on the other end of the phone conversation (ie a tv on low volume), no one can hear. These are sold for much more than they are actually worth. They are comfortable and the buttons are great, but not worth anything over $60.",neutral

"One thing for sure, the service of Amazon is not what I had expected. Initially the when the order was placed, Amazon cancelled the order in about 4-5 hours, the reason gives was ""Cingular cannot process your order on the information given, since Amazon does not have the requirements that Cingular wants, we are cancelling your order"", Awww C'mon Amazon, if you cannot communicate with Cingular, I guess then you guys should not be doing business with Cingular, or there should be a statement somewhere stating that the Order can be cancelled for any reason (the prime being ""Cosmic Radiaton""). So I tried placing the order again, it was processed after about 4-5 futile attempts, and the information that was provided was the identical as the first time. The estimated delivery date was 10th Sept. So far it was a struggle....So I checked the status of the order a day later and the estimate delivery date is Oct 12th!!!!!. WoW. So much so for stating that this ""Item Ships in 24 hrs"". It has been a fustrating experience so far. Will wait for a day or so, else there are other places online that can be given a try. Do not buy from Amazon!!!!!.",negative

You may have a different experience in a different car (I drive a 2009 Toyota Prius) or if you have a smaller, lighter iPod or phone (I have a video iPod about two years old). Also I wish that the info stated that the mount included an Auxillary Cable (I ordered one,then had to cancel the order). Other than that, it has been a worthwhile purchase. It's very handy!",positive
There comes a point in time when our home alarm system needs a new battery....and the Zeus 12V 5AH rechargeable battery was just the right replacement.

"As opposed to the other reviews posted here, this product works just fine! 5 STARS. It would be nice if instructions came with the product, but I found the key to using the holster is the front of the RAZR faces towards the belt clip, with the battery cover facing out.

"I use these at the gym, connecting my favorite MP3 playlists. Great sound,no difference between the wired headphones and these. I've also have used them to make calls and receive calls on my phone(not often), people tell me that I sound fine. NOW the glitch, I use these strictly for music listening on the train, or connect to my laptop for movie watching and they work great, but I do notice that if I'm listening to music with my Blackberry curve and a call comes in the music shuts off and I can't hear the person calling me. I don't know if I'm doing anything wrong, I do press the connect button on my phone and no sound. If I call out to a party, no problem.

"I had a Motorola V190 and I wanted the RAZR cause it looked much more cool and my husband had one and liked his. So, I bought a magenta RAZR. I really liked the way it looked, it was easy to use and the talk/standby time was good. However, about a month after I got the phone it started powering down on it's own or the screen would go white (if during conversation it would disconnect). I bought a new battery thinking that was the problem...it wasn't. My husband then was going to upgrade the firmware on it only to discover that the phone already had the most recent firmware. I did use the phone for about a year as it only powered down about twice a month but after about a year it started powering down daily. It wasn't convenient to have it power down during an important conversation. So, I took the SIM card out and put it back in the V190. The V190 may not ""look"" cool but at least it's reliable. I now have a KRZR K1, but I will hold on to my V190 just in case. My husband never had a problem with his RAZR but I do know a couple of other people that had the same problem with theirs. I would never buy another RAZR.",neutral
"Battery arrived quick, but the blister pack was unsealed and the battery was uncharged and unchargeable. I left a poor vendor review before I bothered to try to contact the company. Dopey. MobileCity got in touch with me and sorted everything out very quickly. I've no reason to think it would have been any different if I called them before rating them. Sadly, it seem I can edit this product review, but not change the star rating. Go figure. I'd be happier if Amazon would just delete my comment.",negative
"First off, this is a good sturdy product. I like it, it makes the cell phone (8310) easier to use - without figure prints and facial oil mark. However, there are flaws in the design: 1) The cell phone was in tray upright. It make the motion of pulling out the phone kind of awkward - I have to turn the phone around every time I pull it out of the belt. 2) Since it is sitting upright, the camera lens was not protected. It seems to rely on the transparent plastic to protect it - but it creates another problem (see 3) 3) The plastic wrap makes the image from the camera blurry, you can't really use it unless you take it off... it violates the whole purpose of having a case to begin with. I have to punch a hole on the plastic to make the camera usable. The Otterbox folks should redesign the case so that the phone will sit upside down and more plastic will extend from the bottom of the belt clip holder to protect the camera lens. Period.",positive
"This is my first bluetooth, wireless headset, so I have little to compare it against except my previous wired headsets. It's okay. Sometimes the calls are clear, other times people complain that the sound is muffled or distant. I love the wireless aspect of it, of course. I don't like having the ""hook"" around my ear so I took it off and it works fine without it thus far. It runs out of battery more quickly than I'd hoped, after a day or two. Again, maybe this is due to my ignorance of how bluetooth headsets work. Maybe I'll revisit this review after I get another similar product.",neutral
"The instruction manual says the earbuds should fit 'snugly' in the ear. Ha!! Unlike other bluetooth headsets, this one requires that the vibration sensor rest against your cheekbone. that contact creates a little bit of pressure/leverage that is pulling the bud out of the ear canal. everytime you move your jaw as you talk you're also helping dislodge the earbud. And the earbuds they provide are not the soft silicone kind that fit to the shape of your ear and make a great sound shield. These buds are hard plastic and the shapes not nearly as varied as they need to be in order for you to get a good variety. the tip they attach to also cannot flex. most ear canals do not go into the head at a right angle, so why does jawbone design an earbud that extends at a right angle to the device?! what's so maddening is that it's not that hard to make a good earbud. how they messed this up is beyond me.",negative
Very dissatisfied with this product! It doesn't boost my cell reception at all. I plan on returning it.,negative
"I ordered for rather silly reasons: the price and the color. The red headset matches my red Palm Treo perfectly. And the fact that it sells for under 50 bucks is nothing to sneeze at. But despite ordering it for all the wrong reasons, it works well. However, I do have some words of caution. First, it is so small that there is the danger of losing it which I almost did on more than one occasion. The fix to that is to make sure the headset in your ear snugly. Second, it shuts off after you charge it and you seem to have to hit the ""on"" button just right to turn it back on which is frustrating. Third, if you have a Palm, you have to re-pair it every time you turn the headset back on, which is annoying. Fourth, the sound quality is not the same as if you were speaking directly into the phone which is probably the same for all headsets, but there is no buzzing or static that is experienced with other headsets. A great thing about this headset is the range. I was using it the other day in the house and forgot to take the phone with me to the other room! I only started to lose the signal when I was about 70-80 feet away from the phone. Since this is my first experience with a Bluetooth device, I am not sure is this is the norm, but I was impressed nonetheless!",neutral

"Motorola razr pouch. This pouch looks good, feels good, fits the phone nicely, and removing the phone for a call is easy. It seems well-crafted of nice leather. A couple of drawbacks would make me think twice about buying another. 1. Adhesive that I suppose bonds the leather lining to the outer leather came off on the camera lens of my phone. Difficult to clean off. 2. The clip which holds the pouch on your belt is very tight--a good thing--but that makes the stitching on the leather covering the metal clip come loose after a couple of weeks of use--a bad thing.

The camera strap is chest high. No belt buckle to scatch it. I looked at the screen protector. It is as scratched up as the one I replaced that had been on the camera for 3 years. Appears soft plastic that just a finger nail touching it will scratch it. I am one to leave the screen protector on at all times, although Nikon recommends taking it off and using for storage. If you are one to leave it on all the time, get the Nikon branded one. Fits like the Nikon for a fraction of the price.",neutral

"The thickness of the product is excessive, maybe mine was defective, but once I added to my Iphone I could not do anything on my screen, so I passed my finger over my iphone and I got no action from my Iphone. I decided to dismantle the mirror screen in order to be sure there weren't extra layers in the protector but I found two layers the mirror one (that does not have gum) and other thick very thick layer that had gum (the once that paste the protector in the screen). Surprise the screen is very very thick so I can not pass my fingers because the protector does not allow me to use the phone.

"Stereo music quality is good, but I've had problems with phone calls and these headphones. I've seen reviews where people said call quality is good, but in my experience the other end has had problems hearing me even when I'm in a quiet environment. My headphones did recently break after about 7 months. I'm not sure exactly when because I hadn't used them in a while. I was going to take them to work with me and I noticed that one of the earpieces broke at the joint where the rubber head cushion meets the plastic near the hinge. I don't care about looking like a dork, so I just taped the two ends back together as best I could. They're not ""as good as new"" but at least I can wear and use them! I taped the unbroken side for reinforcement. Why trash a good pair of headphones that I paid too much money for just because they're ""broken""? Fix them! Would I buy them again? Not for the original price! Maybe for < $50 like they are now.",neutral
"When switching to Verizon from another wireless carrier, I initially bought 6 of the VX5200 for my on-call staff. Within 24 hours, all of them had come to me and complained about their phones. Complaints included: Ring tones that were too soft, Flimsy flip mechanisms in the phone's hinge, The annoying chiming noise the phone makes every time you turn it on or turn it off (and we couldn't find a way to disable it), Cheap feel of the phone, Some of the menus didn't make much sense, Poor reception quality inside the buildings Overall, they were not happy with the phones and didn't feel comfortable using them so I had to take them back and get the motorola E815. There was not much good about the phones other than the: Ability to take pictures, Decent quality speakerphone, Bright screens, Final Recommendation: The phone bravely offers a lot of features for the dollar and were it not for the poor reception and poor build quality, which are deal breakers for me, I would have made my staff stay with this phone. Get this phone only if: 1) this phone fits your budget and/or 2) you don't care about the above listed complaints as this phone will work for those who just need to dial the numbers they need to call.",negative

"At first I was in love with this phone. The text messaging system is awesome, the screen is nice and big with a good picture quality, and the size is an advantage. It also can be very loud if need be, although that wears the battery down rather quickly. It also has the advantage of having a USB port for a charger, which makes the likelihood of having a friend with the same charger higher. HOWEVER, it's small sliding size makes it a little bit fragile. After having this seemingly perfect phone for two and a half months, it is doing some weird things. First, it loses service extremely easily, which it did not do at first. That wouldn't be so bad if the screen didn't also go white whenever this happened. Whenever it whites out like that, I can't do anything; I can't look at pictures, or my numbers, and if I'm working on a textmessage, it gets lost and not saved to drafts. It happens all the time. Obviously this is extremely annoying, and it would seem that the phone is either badly designed, or broken. I have not been unusually rough on this phone, so I don't believe that it should be broken so early on in it's lifespan. My best guess is that the rizer is a problem prone phone, and I would think twice about buying one if I were you.",negative

Like others have stated the buttons are so sensitive and easy to push now that any adjustment results in accidental disconnects.

"I've had this phone for a little more than 6 months. It has been a poor performer and causes more problems than it's worth. My recommendation is to consider something else unless you really like the style or buy a new phone every few months. Here are my gripes: 1. The black undercoating is starting to flake off inside the front flip of phone. Scratches and other blemishes are really noticable. 2. It consistently fails to read the SmartID card precluding any use of the phone unless you power down and restart. Will read ""Insert SmartChip."" Just checked as it's recharging and you guessed it - it says it now. 3. Periodically the phone will fail to identify an access number for voicemail and it takes forever to figure out how to retrieve a usable number. 4. It takes awhile to figure out all the menu options. The phone is stacked with options to get you spend more money on add ons, but it takes your life to get to call history or easily swich to silent mode. I maybe use 1/20 of all the stuff that you can do. 5. There is often long periods after you open the phone where it says ""running"" this prevents any call until is cycles through - this is really irritating. 6. Got to be real careful when saving numbers to the phone vs. smart card. It's not real easy to move a number from the phone to the card. 7. The phone as a real low level volume when it comes to the earpiece. Unlike my last phone, I've got to really concentrate to hear callers if there is any background noise. I will say it's got a loud ring which is good. On the plus side, it does look nice right out of the box, it's got a good battery to allow for the SmartCard not reading indicator, and it's got pretty good reception.",negative

First of all the visor clip presented a problem, if you have thick hard plastic sun visors it might not fit. Second, no one can clearly hear me. I have to hang up and redial using my handset which defeats the whole purpose. Also sometimes the person's voice would just fade for no apparent reason, I was not touching the volume button. The voice activation is limited to your cell phone. Transferring numbers from my cell to the Supertooth was too labor intensive. I really really wanted this to work. But alas for me, it does not. I'm sending it back to Amazon and will be ordering the V1. As a point of comparison my previous headset was a Plantronics 510. The sound quality was okay, but not great and no noise canceling. Also, for me it would keep falling out, but like I said I have small ears.",negative

"We camp every month and it is a challenge keeping electronic devices like phones and iPads charged through the weekend. In the woods you seldom have access to a wall outlet, and the solar charger seems good just for a 75% charge on one device. Memorial weekend I took the Trent: iTorch IMP52D - (5200mAh) that I had charged the prior week. It was small and sleek and easy to pack or pocket. It charged my iPhone twice and still had 50% power come Monday morning. Small enough to fit in your hand, but not at all wimpy, it feels very solid and able to stand up to heavy use. While it did not come with a wall adapter, the iCarrier that I bought at the same time did and it is interchangeable, otherwise you can use your device charger and its USB cable. The product is simple and easy to use, no need to pack an instruction book, which is a bonus when you want to travel light. The added flashlight and laser pointer are just icing on the cake. I can't wait to take this and the iCarrier IMP120D - (12000mAh) charger for a week long summer camp. I'm sure I will be supplying energy for my entire troop.",positive
"Considering this is one of Motorola's higher line bluetooths, I'm very disappointed in the sound quality of this one.

"A friend recently supplied me with a couple of bluetooth headsets to try out to see if I liked them. This model was too long, big, and awkward to put on my ear.

"This headset has excellent sound and ease of use, and the price was right. However, I returned it in fear that my ear would fall off. It is a bit heavy and the ear piece does not fit right, so I spent a lot of time trying to make it fit. Nevertheless, the item was painful to the ear and the manufacturer will need to address that problem. Amazon, by the way, offers a very good price for the legitimate product. I purchased the Plantronics Voyager 510 from Amazon to replace the Motorola HS850, and I'm very happy with it. Excellent sound, ease of use, and no irritation to the ear. In my opinion, the HS850 is perhaps a good option for Van Gogh copycats.",positive

The sound is great, the microphone is clear and faithful to your voice without lots of background noise, and it has a great range for the Bluetooth. The final, and most important, selling point is Plantronics customer service. It is fantastic. The best of any modern electronics company I've interacted with, including Apple. They quickly sort out tech problems if you run across them, it's easy to reach a tech support person, and they'll replace defects or problems without any hassle. Amazing, and compelling for consumers. Buy the 510 while you can, or buy the new Voyager Pro. You won't regret it.",positive

"I bought a new RAV4 and wanted to keep the dogs out of the front seats before they messed them up. I first installed the barrier behind the back seats with the seats upright. It worked fine, but I realized the space might be a little small for our two medium-size dogs. The left vertical support also comes close to the seatbelt reel in the roof for the center passenger. The barrier installed fine, but the left support is a little uneven (no problem functionally). Based on comments by other reviewers, I also cut circles from an old gray sock and placed them above each of the rubber ""suction"" cups at the roof, to keep from marking the roof. To provide more space in the rear for the two dogs, I then folded the rear seats forward and installed the barrier on the back of the folded seats. This, too, worked well. Because the wire mesh barrier is only 18"" high and is fixed near the top of the vertical supports, this left an open space about 12"" high below the barrier. As luck would have it, I found a leftover piece of lightweight 1/8"" plywood (flooring material) which was 18"" high and 48"" wide, exactly the size I needed. I attached this to the bottom of the mesh barrier with two twist ties, which allows me to remove the barrier quickly (you can make out the twist ties in the photo, as well as the sock circles above the upper suction cups). A word about assembly. Lay out all the pieces first, and note that the two vertical extension tubes (parts list letter C) are packed up inside the vertical tubes on the main mesh panel...I thought at first they had been omitted. You'll need to shake to get them out. When assembling, keep the wire mesh facing you, both on the main panel and on the wing mesh panels. Orient the wing mesh panels with the ""vacant"" mesh portions at the top and bottom, as in the photo. The panel clamps must be installled inside these vacant sections. Pushing the panel clamps down over the tubes was the hardest part, but not a major effort. Install the hand nuts (parts list letter H) facing you, so that the vertical supports are at the far side of the barrier. The lower tube ""clamps"" (parts list letter I) are not clamps at all, they are two tapered plugs. Although not shown on the diagram, you insert one in the bottom of each of the vertical extension tubes (C). Then you install a hand nut (H) on each of the two foot ""bushings"" (which are threaded bolts with a rubber bumper on one end...letter E) and stick the threaded end of the foot bushing up into the tube ""clamps"". When installing the barrier, make sure the foot bushings are all the way up into the vertical upright tubes. Then, once you have the tubes extended against the roof as firmly as you can manage using the lower tube clamps (F), use the hand nuts on the bushings to extend the tubes even further, providing additional tension against the roof. Enjoy!",positive
"Finally I now have wireless audio streaming from my phone to my car. I will say that if you have the option an aftermarket radio with built in bluetooth support would probably do a better job, but if you can't or don't want to buy a new radio this is a great solution. I have used this device with two phones, a HTC Touch Pro (Windows mobile) and a Nexus one (Android) with very different results. # The Nexus One works extremely well with this device. Both music and navigation both play over the speakers with very high quality, you can even stream Pandora with it. I would assume calls will play over it and the remote works because they are both in the device specs, but I have not used those features. # The Touch Pro was a completely different story. The dynamic range of the audio from the Touch Pro was absolutely horrible, if I had to compare it to something I would say try listening to a 28kb/s mp3. After hearing the quality I gave up with this device, other users with the same or similar phone might have varied results. I would say this device is made extremely well, it can receive high quality audio and it has a convent USB port for charging your phone. It has a very short (about 3 or 4 inches if memory serves me correctly) audio cable with a nice woven exterior and a matching extender, in case you need a longer cord. If your cigarette lighter port turns off with the car when you turn the car back on it will automatically turn back on and sync with the phone in 2 or 3 seconds. And it is very easy to set up and use. But, you should be warned that depending on what phone or device you have the audio quality could be anywhere between amazing and horrendous. For every review you read about the device having poor audio quality I would note what device they were using, most likely that device has problems with audio quality over bluetooth. I have personally seen how two different devices (both good quality devices) can have extremely different audio quality while streaming to the LiquidAux, and I would imagine that the problem would apply to any bluetooth receiver. All in all, if you need an external bluetooth audio adapter for your car, look no further. I highly recommend this device.",positive

There was no provision in this review for ""0"" stars, so I gave it ""1""",negative
"There are two ways you have your phone work with your car - get a device that you connect to your phone which outputs in a format that your car understands (FM transmitter, line-in), or have something built in, like a car stereo with Bluetooth. I am really a fan of the latter, because there is less clutter, it tends to work more seamlessly, and the cost really doesn't have to be much more - check out Sony's MEXBT3700U, for example. You can wirelessly stream A2DP audio, charge with the built in USB connection, and even use this port to stream music, giving the added benefit of displaying track info on the unit as well as the ability to navigate through songs without having to touch your device. And because it's one single unit, you don't have to worry about getting incoming calls while listening to the radio - it will still notify you. So why are we already a paragraph in and have I not started talking about the LiquidAUX yet? The way I think about this device is in the context of other devices that do a similar - or better - job. By function, it will never be perfect because it's not a fully integrated device - for example if your phone it set to automatically pair, you will only know you are getting a call if the stereo is set to AUX, so if you are listening to the radio, you will miss any incoming calls because the ringer be going through the line-in on the car. The car I have has a built in stereo that is part of the interior styling (volume, tuning, and climate control dials are all similar), so I decided to try the LiquidAUX to connect my iPhone before replacing the stereo, which would mean replacing a whole panel. I liked it because there were limited cables, and that it was one piece, so there wouldn't be too much clutter. Here are the two issues I had with it: 1. The big issue was that there was the static that many other reviews have already outlined. It made calls impossible, and the music was it and miss - there was the popping at quiet points and between songs. Kensington's website says a ground loop isolator should fix the issue, and that they would send one out for free. I called them and they said that it may not fix issues related to the Bluetooth version of the LiquidAUX, but they would send me one anyway if I wanted. I received it after about a week, and it worked - the sound quality is great for both music and voice, and as long as I speak loudly (just as with the MEXBT3700U's built in mic), I can be heard. However, now I have this huge drum like object that I try to tuck away in a compartment just so the device works as it should. 2. The forward/back buttons do not work with the iPhone - admittedly an issue with the iPhone, but meaning that I cannot justify attaching the remote to the wheel due to it's limited functionality. So, to sum up, the ground loop isolator makes this device passable in terms functionality. But the clutter also defeats one of the reasons I got it in the first place. It definitely is not as great as a more integrated solution, but for twenty five bucks and a wait for the device to make it work, it at least does it's job. Also, it's worth mentioning that if you are considering getting it because of less clutter, bear in mind that you will lose your car's power output and replace it with a USB power port. If that doesn't work for you, you'd have to get a socket splitter that would again defeat the object of having it out of the way. Hope this helps!",neutral
"The fellow who has the video review of this Jabra BT5020 Bluetooth Headset put it into his pocket and broke it. I have not had this problem at all as I have been reasonably careful with the device as it is small. It works fine, connects with my phone, and is lightweight and comfortable to wear. Two things should be revised by Jabra in their next effort: First, my friends tell me that it is not quite as clear as my old Jabra 250V headset as it seems whatever sound dampening technology they have incorporated provides a less clear sound. Secondly, the ear jells slip off of the unit very easily and they should redesign them so they stay on. I have put a small rubber band on the jell so that it is not lost if slips off.",positive

"First, Ignore the comments from people complaining about the lack of features - that is EXACTLY what makes this phone different. If you wanted a phone with a camera [that takes bad pictures], an MP3 player [with bad quality sound], a PDA [with crippled keyboard/software] or a GPS receiver [that takes forever to lock and eats batteries], then you should have known this isn't for you. You would ignore anyone that would buy a minivan and then complain that it isn't a race car and you should also ignore anyone that buys this phone and then complains about what is missing. And almost everything IS missing. It's a phone - a very good phone. An unpretentious device to make/receive calls and it does this better than probably 99% of the phones you can buy today. It has great sound quality, a very large and easy to read display, and remarkable battery life. If you need to send/receive text messages, it can do that, but the large display makes this a capability for occasional use only. For those of us accustomed to nested menus and linked feature lists, operating the phone is almost too simple and most people trip themselves up in the beginning because they expect it be more complicated than it is. It will make a phone connection when other phones can't find the signal and it will hold on to the signal much better than any of the 'full featured' phones I've owned. You can read it at night and in the noon day sun. You can hear it in a car with the windows down. You use it for a week without needing a recharger.(4 and a half hours of talk time and nearly two weeks of standby time). For what it is - you can't find a better value. If you want a cell phone that will do everything but wipe your, uh, nose [but do it poorly], then you really shouldn't expect to get that from a phone that costs $33 outright without contract (and you know it...) The English Manual is available online and it is small because there isn't much to explain. To get it to ring (louder), simply push the UP button on the large, round rocker switch in the middle. To ring quieter, or go into vibrate mode, simply pus the Down button until it vibrates. It IS a great device and a great value for making voice calls.",positive

I followed the directions, including making sure the low power antenna was greater than 20 feet away and pointed towards the high power antenna before turning on. This time, it initially showed a green light, then a red light and the light faded. I moved the low power antenna further away from the high power antenna and tried again. This time the light didn't come on anymore. I tried moving things to the way everything worked the very 1st time, but no light would come on. It was using power, because the low power unit was getting warm. The coax connection point was also getting really warm. But, it was no longer boosting the signal (no change in cell phone bars).

"The idea of this Bluetooth headset is a good one however I had some problems with the voice commands capability. On more than one occasion in a months time, it stopped recognizing any voice commends (like 'dial voicemail' 'call back' etc). I had to power it off and back on a couple of times to get it to work again. I also thought the caller id announce would be nice, but in practice, it only works if you wear the headset all the time. If you are not wearing it and miss the caller id announce, but put it in your ear as the phone is ringing and press the button to answer the call, it only works about half of the time. I actually missed several calls and had to call people back due to this. Also, I find that I like to just put the headset on when I need to make or receive a call and then take it off. For this, I feel that the Plantronics 925 is a better choice since it's a bit easier to put in my ear and take off and it comes with a nice charging case for storage. With the BlueAnt, I always had trouble figuring out where to put it when not in use. Also, on the BlueAnt, callers said I sounded more muffled than on the Plantronics although they could hear less background noise. In practice, noise cancellation isn't really a big deal because I find that I would rather make a call in a semi-quiet environment anyway. If I'm in my car, I just roll the windows up, no big deal. I ended up returning this headset mainly due to the reliability issue. The fact that my voice didn't sound as good as other Bluetooth headsets was also a deal breaker for me. I'd rather sound better and not have as good noise cancellation than have good noise cancellation but sound crappy.",negative

It blinks in standby, it blinks when in operation, it blinks all the dang time. But, if you can get passed that, it does work pretty well. The sound is a little tinny, but pretty clear. And unlike all my other bluetooth headsets, the headset volume only operates the headset, and doesn't link to the phone volume - this means that you have more adjustability for volume level and loudness, which is good.

"1st time nextel customer -shoulda done more consumer research before opening a business acct. w/them. 8 days ago we receive 1 i305 & 4 i205's. we paid the promo price of 24.99 for the i205's. i was warned by 2-3 friends that the plastic charger flap on the i205 was annoying because it wouldn't stay shut... we'll they were ALL correct! on all 4 of our i205's the rubber charger/plug cover just pops open - right after you close it. in addition it feels & looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic. the standard battery needs to be charged EVERYnight. it has not received any positive compliments yet from friends & other cell users. as for the i305 - it's the complete opposite of the i205 (but the battery like is aout the same, very short). we're keping the 305 & all the 205's are going back. haven't used them enough to comment on the clarity. as for nextel - that's a whole other talk show. i just wish i would have done a little more comsumer research before i signed the bottom line.",negative

"I work in sales from my home so I'm on the phone quite a bit. I was using a GE cordless phone with a corded headset for a number of years and that worked well but, was limited. I decided that it was time to take the plunge and get some new technology. With a price tag over $200 I was expecting a lot more from Plantronics. The sound quality is good but, there is constant crackling and pops in the background, just loud enough to be distracting. I thought this might be my WiFi system but when that is turned off the subtle background noise is still there. Plantronics could have done a much better job on the display. I've seen better ones on toys. With the ability to store 200 names and phone numbers you should have an easy way of accessing them. In my phone with only about 75 names there's plenty of button presses to find the correct one. The headset is very light weight comfortable and easy to grab and put on your ear. Unfortunately this doesn't make up for the shortcomings so, I gave it only three stars.",neutral

Do not use this to watch movies. I use this with my laptop so I am 5 ft. away at the most and there are multiple long interruptions.

"This is a great little bluetooth headset at a very reasonable price. I'm a first time bluetooth user and it was extremely simple to pair with my Motorola SLVR 7 and use right out of the box. I researched many headsets before selecting the Plantronics 510 Voyager. One review said the 510 might be a problem for glasses wearers, so I almost didn't buy it because of that comment. However, I wear reading glasses while working as well as glasses for distance when I drive a car and I haven't had a bit of trouble with the over the ear configuration on the 510. It is so lightweight that I hardly know it's on my ear. And the sound quality is superb! I can talk for long periods of time and find it to be a real pleasure to use. Callers don't even realize I'm using a headset. Actually, the sound quality is an improvement over using my SLVR without a headset. Amazing!",positive

"I didn't get this phone for top-of-the-line features. The camera is inferior to those on the new Sony Ericsson phones, but I didn't buy a new phone for a camera (already have a digicam). The phone's memory is small compared to a lot of other devices and can't be expanded like some other phones (e.g. Nokia 6230), but I haven't experienced any problems with memory yet. Of course, I'm not using this phone to listen to MP3s (already have a player), just to store some wallpaper and MP3 ringtones. If you want a phone to store a large MP3 playlist, I wouldn't recommend the RAZR for you. I _did_ get this phone to have a cool, functional new phone, and so far I'm very satisfied. The sound and speakerphone are great, the reception hasn't failed me yet, and the battery time is decent for such a vibrant display (it's huge) and small form factor. The only major dissatisfaction I've had is that the inner screen and keypad scratch easily (way more than other Motorola phones). I've had the phone for less than a week, and even though I'm extremely careful, there are already blemishes all over the inside (the outside is flawless). I guess my advice is buy a protective cover(?) when you get the phone; I wish I would have, because this is a beautiful phone.",positive

"Our new house's roof sheathing has an foil (heat radiant) foil lining one side (facing into the attic)- resulting in a cel signal force field.

The reviews that I read through my research, were good enough to convince me to throw a couple hundred bucks at our problem. Overall, we get a better signal inside than we did before. My issue is that lack of consistent signal boosting from this unit: anywhere from 1-4 bars now. I shouldn't complain, since I couldn't even receive calls during the majority of the ""pre-ZBoost"" era, but I still have some calls dropped (AT&T on my iPhone 3G) with my ZBoost indicating proper installation/operation.

"PMK 5800 cannot be used in populated areas. The product is designed and engineered very well. I think this is a very clever idea. Its dimensions fit my car (Audi A4 2006) perfectly. Nice lighted controls, easy setup. PMK 5800 picked up my AT&T Tilt voice recognition with no additional setup. However, there is a fatal problem in this design - you cannot use it in populated areas with lots of FM stations. I live 60 miles from Boston. Every odd FM channel here is taken. Even channels in between deliver a lot of interference from surrounding odd channels. No matter what you do - you cannot beat the FM environment around you. PMK 5800 has a weak FM transmitter so the better audio system you have the less chance you get any recognizable sound out of PMK 5800. It delivers an overwhelming background noise. Forget MP3 music playback. Simple design change could alter the future of this product - ability to output through its already existent mini USB port. With this capability PMK 5800 could be integrated through cassette player adapters or directly through vehicle's stereo system. Unfortunately I have to abandon this product in its current state and do not recommend it to anybody outside Siberia",negative

"I have been using this unit for the past 6 months. I am currently using another brand (Jabra cruiser2) Here is what I have found regarding the Motorola unit. Pros: Easy to use, pairs easily and I never had any problem with it recognizing my phone when turning on the unit. Sound quality through the unit and through the radio was very good. I have not had any issues with voice recognition like other reviewers. I do like the ""preset"" FM frequencies to a point (more below)People I have called said they can hear me clearly and I have not had any complaints. I use this unit everyday, I have a 40 minute commute each way 2 days a week and a 1 hr commute one day a week and usually on the road for 2-3 hours one day a week. I find that it will keep a charge the whole week. Streaming music from my phone through the unit to the radio is excellent. With a clean channel, the sound is very good. Cons: After 6 months the charging socket broke. Since I travel a fair distance and through a couple of cities, the preset FM frequencies sometimes are frustrating. It will seem to pick the same ""random"" frequencies, but they are not clean channels. You have no ability to specifically choose a frequency that you want. So you end up hitting the button repeatedly trying to find a frequency and sometimes the unit will cycle back to the same frequencies over and over. I know that you can save presets, but that doesn't always seem to help.",neutral

"UPDATED Feb 9th 2008: Well the BT5020 is now dead, I'm sending it back to jabra and we will see from there what happens. Following my initial review I returned the unit for replacement once and that fixed some of the sound issues, not all of them but enough that I was acceptably pleased. Over the 6 months I found the unit to be functional and seldom did it offer me reason to complain, the sound was clear and I could be heard without many ever offering complaint, unless I was outdoors in a wind, but I think some aspects are to be understood and tolerated. I will note though, using the dual connection capability was nice, but glitchy, especially when hooked to a nextel and using direct connect, then things truly got fouled up and generally connections were lost to the phones and often calls. Over all I won't lower or raise my review on this unit, it worked when it worked and while far from stellar, I think for 30 bucks it was acceptable. ________________________________________________________________ I'm new to the BT ear piece market, this being my second in the past few months. My first was/is the Jabra BT500, which is very enjoyed... once I got used to tolerating the eargel discomfort, and no adjustability for fit. So my hopes were high with the BT5020, in getting rid of the eargels and allowing for some angle and length of speaker position, would fix my comfort levels. So my first impressions of the BT5020 was wow, this is comfortable, it weighs less, no eargel and the size is very balanced with the over all package. Turned on the power and it started in pair mode, and paired without a glitch or bump with my Sanyo 8400. So far so good, I was working in the yard, so decided to leave it on and see how I liked the fit and feel. And to speak straight, I forgot I had it on and got the sudden reminder of it real quick when my wife called, the vibrate alert went off (I'd forgotten it had vibrate alert) and I nearly came unglued tell I recalled what was doing it. This thing is that comfortable, no feeling like my ear is plugged up, no strange pulling or pushing, or slippage to keep telling me I have something on/in my ear. The phone call however set off the first warning signs, there was very distinct static and crackling, this with my phone on my hip on the same side as the earpiece. I kept it in mind but kept working for a few hours before deciding to go and really play with my new earpiece. I started conducting some tests around the house, called customer service of my phone company, and figured to kill two birds with one stone. I had the phone on a shelf at the same level as my ear, about 3 feet away. The static wasn't noticed this time so I began moving around the room and it returned. After 9-12 feet distance, the static was so bothersome that if the CSR had answered, I'd not have been able to conduct business. I tried moving it closer and at different angles with varying results and little improvement. Static wasn't noticed as a background noise or white noise type, but direct distortion of voice and or background music (I was on hold a while), it changed with the volume/beat of the sound I was supposed to be hearing clearly. To say the least, right now I'm not pleased; I truly like the feel, fit, weight and appearance of this headset. There is a notable creak from the flexible portion but nothing I will notice after a few days of using something. The button position for those used to the BT500, as I am, is a little different as it is a bit harder to tap the answer/end button, for you can't really just pinch the end of the mic area and catch the button, as you can with the BT500, but those are small things and a few days of playing will pan out if they become larger issues. I've worn wired headsets for years, mostly Plantronic or Jabra versions'; so moving to BT has been a learning experience. I'm not going to give up on the BT5020 just yet, I'm going to further test it over the weekend, at work where I'll have multiple other phones and radios on or around my person, at times talking on various radios of various frequencies. I think this will truly tell me if the BT5020 can hold mustard, or if it gets packed up on Monday and sent back, something I'm usually ill tolerant of doing unless something is truly truly broken and/or a turd.",neutral

"I just got this phone a few days ago. It is absolutely amazing. I wasn't planning on getting this phone until I actually saw one in person. I wasn't too impressed with the pictures of this phone on the internet but when I saw one in person, I couldn't close my mouth. I just had to get it. The LCD screen is very big and bright (you can change the brightness level of course). You'll be amazed by the rotating camera/camcoder feature of this phone. You can zoom in/out in camera mode and it has the best video recording mode out of any cell phone out there. You can download mp3s and set them as your ringtones or play full mp3s. You can even download video clips and watch TV shows. The phone came with a music video and the video quality was exceptional. The phone has 70MB built in memory but it comes with a 32MB transflash card which is one half the size of your fingernail. You can buy a bigger transflash card if you need more storage space. The fact that this phone is quad band means it will work almost anywhere in the world, which is a big plus. The phone is roughly the same size as Motorolla Razr but it is lighter and has superior features not to mention it's a SLIDER PHONE! However, no phone is perfect. -I wish the phone had a small hole for cell phone straps or keychain. -Camera does not have a flash. -You cannot set MP3's that aren't DRM (Digital Rights Movement) protected as ringtones. You will need to change the MP3 file extention to .3GP to be able to set them as ringtones, which is a little annoying. You can still play all the MP3's on the phone, but only the ones with DRM protection can be set as ringtones (unless you change the file extention to .3GP). I suggest you go to one of the Tmobile stores and actually see the phone for yourself.",positive

"I had another less expensive brand heart rate monitor/watch. I don't need all the bells and whistles that many products offer.

This device offers more than I need it for so it may be excellent for others but I may return it and go back to my old reliable name brand device which sells for a fraction of the cost. Oh, and a MAJOR con for me is the ridiculously bulky charger that comes with the watch. I have to charge it often and the charger is this huge clip that you have to clamp the watch in to and then plug that in to either a USB or wall. Only thing I really like is the design/look but I have plenty of other watches for general wear.",neutral
"PLEASE, PLEASE READ MY WHOLE ARTICLE BEFORE BUYING ANY BOOSTER SYSTEMS. I purchased this booster some time ago, Oct 2009. Upon installation, I did not see any improvement. I contacted Wi-Ex and after a few days of bitching, they sent me a new system. The new system was a bit better but still did not do what they claim it to do. I've continued to use this booster for 8 months total now and here is my analysis. First, they claim that this unit will cover a home of 2500 sq ft. LIE. Second, they claim that this will reduce dropped calls... HALF A LIE Here are the facts: 1- You will only get a boosted signal from the base unit ONLY if the receiving antenna has a strong signal. I have 2 bars in my attic, where the receiving antenna is installed, and the coverage range from the base unit is only anywhere from 2 inches to 3 feet from the base unit. 2- In my situation, the coverage area dramatically drops as soon as I'm out of the 3 foot radius of the base unit. As soon as I'm about 10 feet from the base unit, the signal will drop to zero bars on my phone (Palm Pre) and the phone will intermittently switch to Roaming. (This also occurs with an HTC Touch Pro 2 as well). I contacted Wi-Ex and they told me that the max range of the boosted signal will be 15 feet. That's right, he said 15 feet. They why do they advertise full house coverage? And also claim a 2500 sq ft home coverage on this unit. I was also told that if my input signal is only two bars, that the output from the base unit is reduced to a lower radius/range. This is not what is advertised. As a matter of fact, while I was on the phone with the rep, he kept asking me to repeat myself because I kept breaking up. He asked me to repeat myself three times, yes, three times, and my distance to the base unit? About two feet at that time and the bar strength indication on the phone? That was at 1 bar!! Yes, 1 bar!!! So basically, if you have full bars (a strong signal) outside of your home, then the boosted signal inside your home will be greater. I want everyone to know this. DO NOT BE MISGUIDED!!!! This system is only as good as your signal outside your home. If you have FULL strength outside your home and have no signal strength inside your --- a basement for example, then, you will have good coverage in your basement room ONLY. Also, I wanted to troubleshoot this some more so I bought a Wilson 800/1900 booster. Identical to this Wi-Ex unit. I tried a combination of several things. I used the Wi-Ex receiver with the Wilson base and the Wilson transmitting antenna, the Wilson receiving antenna with the Wi-Ex base unit and the Wilson antenna and so forth..... and this is what I learned: The Wilson system gives you a better coverage radius than the Wi-Ex unit. However, the Wilson unit continuously loses it's signal and the base unit's LED will switch from green to amber to red quite often! Again, neither of these units really improves your indoor signal if your outdoor signal is not at 100%. DO NOT EXPECT YOUR INDOOR RECEPTION TO BE BOOSTED THROUGHOUT YOUR ENTIRE 2500 SQ FT HOME!! This will NOT happen. These two units are misrepresented to make a sale. This is not to say that the Wilson is a better buy, it is not! The coverage radius is only increased by about 1 foot using the Wilson unit. As soon as you are out of this range, your signal will drop and switch over to Roaming as well. Do not waste your money on either of these two systems if all you need is coverage at your computer desk. You might as well buy their lower priced units that you suction cup to your window. These will give you that same result and you don't have to climb into your attic or bore holes in your home to hang an external antenna. More importantly, they cost about $100 less. I have disconnected both units and the signal strength at my desk is at 2 bars without a booster. (Intermittently of course but good enough and better than with the boosters in place). I of course, lose my signal in the basement, but the boosters didn't provide me with better signal strength either so for me, it's not a loss. Note: I did abide by the distance requirements called for by each manufacture and those called for by the FCC. I only operated my cell in close proximity only to perform my tests. At no time should you operate your equipment outside the limitations set forth in the user's manuals.",negative

"I upgraded to this phone nearly 2 months ago, and overall I like it a lot. I have not taken advantage of all the features on this phone, so I will only talk about the things I have experience with: cell-phone quality, camera, and audio/video player ability. There is a silver version available, but I was more partial to red. First off, the cell phone is sleek and smart looking. The not-too-slim profile fits easily in any standard shirt or pant pocket. The 2.2 inch screen is very generous for a cell phone, and is easier on the eyes when watching videos, surfing the web, etc. You can receive calls without having to open the phone and thankfully the audio quality of the calls is very good. The 2 mega-pixel camera is good for a cell phone. The pictures taken are crisp and lack the fuzziness that some other cell-phone cameras have. The zoom is not all that great, but certainly it is better than having none. However, when taking pictures, you cannot zoom in when your resolution is set to the highest setting. You can also take pictures on the fly without having to open the phone to access the camera. Good enough for still photographs, but pretty useless for anything fast. Pretty much what I would expect from a cell phone. I am not that impressed with the video-capturing option, though you can use zoom during filming. My old cell phone was not able to do that. I am very happy with both the audio/video player functions. With a 4 gig microsd card, you can play a lot of music or videos on the shine with little noticeable skip between different songs/videos. With the ear-buds, music is surprisingly crisp and clear. This can function as a good audio player. You can create folders on the microsd card, which can be similar to playlists. The video quality was clear in the small portrait view, but suffers in quality when the larger landscape view is used. Although, it is not so bad that you cannot tell what you are looking at. For me, the landscape view quality was adequate (not good or great). However, what is great is that if you find a good converter for the .gpp video file extension, you can play full length movies fairly well. You can find a .gpp converter for free on the internet. The skip forward function is useful because it speeds after a little while (good for long video files), but takes some time to get used to because of the joystick navigation. And speaking of the joystick navigation, it does take time to become proficient in it. But it does not detract from using the phone at all. There are two negative things about this phone that I want to mention which prevent me from giving it 5 stars: I can see how this phone would not be a good text-messenger phone, since the keys seem a little squished and can be difficult for people with big fingers.

"I like the way this works and it sounds good. But less than a month into operation, the retractable microphone (which turns the unit off and on) will no longer retract. This means the unit is on all the time, which means I have to charge it every night. That's a pain. Also, it automatically answers calls when I'm in the truck ... and sometimes I don't want to talk!",neutral

"This little charger works really well, but I do not recommend storing it with the phone's cord plugged in. When the metal on my phone cord's charging end makes contact with the metal border around the charger, it will spark and short the whole thing out. From there, the only way to get the charger working again is to plug it back into the micro-USB charger, which resets everything. Not a huge deal, but the sparks are concerning, and I don't know why the charger even needs that metal border in the first place. It seems aesthetic, and dangerous. I have since stopped storing the charger with a phone cord plugged into it, and only plug the cord in when I am ready to charge my phone. Otherwise, the product is great. I can usually boost my phone 2 or 3 times, which is great when it gets heavy use throughout the day. It does not take long to charge from low to full either.",neutral

"Very first time I plugged in, the music started playing from my N95-8GB on the car radio. Then I tried to pair up the remote. It would not work. I followed all instructions and still it would not work. Tried it for 30 mins and all possible combinations. Still it would not work. Finally it also started locking my N95. So every time it connects to Bluetooth of the device. Connection accepted message would come up on my phone and the phone hanged. The only way to get rid of it is to disconnect and reconnect the battery. The documentation is not good either. I was thiking all the time that I had put the battery incorrectly. I am giving it 2 stars because maybe it is just me....tommorow I will try one more time and change my review if it works. I have since done a complete hard reset on the N95 phone.",negative
"I bought this product expecting it to protect my Sansa, in addition to allowing it to be arm-mounted while running. In reality, the rubber is as thin as can be, and does not stand up to repeated use. After a couple weeks of using this product, the loop on the back that the arm-strap uses started to tear in the corner, and the small tear grew into a massive split almost overnight. Moreover, the rubber is extremely thin, and does not offer any real shock protection, let alone screen protection for the Sansa. I've learned a valuable lesson about buying cheap products.",negative
"The phone looks good and has a great design. Here are the negatives. It falls short on features that other cheaper phones has to offer. Navigating the software is slow. I don't understand why a company like Motorola didn't include numbering the selection features so navigating is faster and easier. You always have to scroll for the selection features you want. This is very annoying. The Razor has a big screen, but all the feature selections text is small. Only when you dial a phone number is the text easy to read. The wallpaper is in both the exterior and the interior. You can't have two separate wallpaper. The wallpaper is tinted when you make feature selections in the background making it very hard to view the text. This is the most annoying. Only when you select no wallpaper on both the exterior and the interior can you view the text and the external clock better. The camera phone could be better. My other cheaper phone took better pictures. And when you are talking on the phone and you need to give someone a phone number from your cell phone book, you can't. Here are the positives: The ring tones are loud and not distorted. The speaker phone sounds good. The calendar works great. You can reorder the feature selections. I like the key pad. The alarm clock feature is excellent as you can set more than one with different ring tones. The alarm and calendar also work when you turn off the phone. I discovered this one afternoon at a movie theatre. I tuned off my cell phone out of respect for my fellow movies goers and, RING! RING! RING! The alarm came on right in the middle of the movie. Despite its short comings, I'll live with it until a better phone comes along.",neutral

The headset sometimes feels loose, but it has never fallen out even when jumping on and off of tractors and trucks. I wear glasses and have had no problems with the fit of the headset. It is also quite comfortable even when it is worn all day. It also fits nicely inside a welding hood. Everything about this headset is first rate. Battery life is great.

"I shopped for battery extenders for my iPhone 3Gs over a period of several months before deciding to buy the Imax Power IMP500. I didn't like the idea of the ""attached"" extenders I read about with other units because they looked cumbersome to hold, would interfere with my car mount, and battery life was more limited. When I found the Imax IMP500, I was able to watch a ""You-tube"" demonstration showing how it worked. I quickly decided to buy it based on huge capacity, a ""retractable cable"" connection to the iPhone for more flexible use, adapters for other devices, and great price for the capabilities. It has met my expectations in every way. I don't use it often, but when I do need it, I know that I don't have to worry about capacity. Recently my original iPhone car charger quit working so I simply use the IMAX instead. The only problem that I had was quickly remedied by outstanding customer support. I had broken the iPhone/Imax connector when I put the iPhone and the Imax both in my Levis front pocket while it was charging. Apparently the connector got ""tweaked"" when I bent over (pants too tight) and it broke. I sent an email to Imax customer support and also called the phone number provided. I was surprised to get connected with John within a few minutes and he quickly offered to replace the broken part at no charge. I received a new (looks like an improved design) connector in the mail and I'm now able to use the Imax again. I am being more careful about how I carry it but the flexibility it offers is great. I focus on quality when I buy and this is a good example of a high quality product with high quality support at a very reasonable price. I highly recommend it.",positive
"I recently dropped my land line and went 100% wireless for telephone service; with this change, I wanted to make sure I didn't suffer from numb arm talking on the smaller cell phone for longer periods and wanted to use a hands-free approach. My previous experiences with that were not very satisfying back in the day of earbuds and dangling wires. But, with a new cellphone came Bluetooth wireless capability, which opened up a new world of options. I had played with a number in the store, but didn't get any real world experience with them. But, I really liked the design and feel of the H700. I did some research - much of it through reviews here on Amazon; this left me a bit skeptical as there were many unfavorable reviews written here - they mentioned negatives like poor sound quality, minimum range, and Bluetooth connective problems to name a few. But, I decided to side with some other review I had read and the positive reviews on Amazon. The bottom line is I am very happy with my H700. I have experienced absolutely no problems - the people I have talked to all can hear me fine, and I can hear them; I have had the H700 up to 7 feet from my phone with no reception problems; and the H700 was easy to setup with my phone (LG VX8300) and immediately connects whenever I turn the device on. Feature-wise, the H700 is great! The buttons are easy to use and understand and the flip mic is great idea...the phone rings, just flip it open (keep it closed to conserve power) and the call is answered immediately; flip it closed to end the call and it powers down as well. The H700 also features a button for answering and ending calls if you don't want to power down the unit. I highly recommend the Motorola H700 as your Bluetooth headset choose - I have yet to find a negative about it.",positive
The screen works just fine and was relatively easy to install.

"I have owned 2 Plantronics headsets -- The 665 and its predecessor, the 655. Both have suffered the same fate. The little rubber ear tips are flimsy and keep breaking. When I pick up the headset, the ear tip falls out. I purchased the ear tip replacement pack, which costs about $10 and you get 3 ear tips -- 1 small, 1 medium, and 1 large. Given that I only have a need for 1 size, I basically had to pay $10 for one ear tip... which broke after 30 days. The headset sounds pretty good, fits in my ear OK, and people say they can hear me pretty well. Despite all of these positives, I will be replacing it with another brand.",negative

"I traded in a Nokia phone for the KRZR a few weeks ago. The KRZR doesn't drop as many calls as the Nokia, but in the areas where the Nokia typically dropped calls, the sound quality on the KRZR is terrible. At least it's better than having the call dropped. The KRZR synchronized over bluetooth using iSync on my Macintosh without any trouble at all, so I was happy about that. I also bought a 2Gb SD card for it which I was able to load songs onto over bluetooth so I didn't need to buy a USB cable or SD reader. The Nokia had a nice feature where I could set the phone to beep once when it rang. This was good in meetings. Haven't figured out how to make this work on the KRZR yet. This phone is advertised as an MP3 player, but the adapter to connect regular headphones to it is not included. I see that I can order it from Amazon for abou $5, but none of the cingular stores I've gone to have it. A slightly annoying thing about the phone is that no games come with it. Or I should say, all the games are just trial versions which let you play for a minute and then ask you to buy the upgrade. I don't have a data plan with Cingular, so I have no idea how much it would actually cost to download games or music from Cingular since I believe you pay buy the byte when you don't have a plan.",neutral

"This inexpensive little ""Switcheasy"" clip looked like a promising solution to holding the Nike plus sensor onto your shoe if, like me, you prefer running shoes other than Nikes with the built-in sensor pocket (I am a big fan of Asics Gel Kayanos). In fact, I bought two ""clear"" clips. I have a different pouch that laces onto my shoes, but it's hard to remove since you've got to unlace the shoe completely, so I thought this clip would give me an easy way to change between walking, running, hiking shoes etc. It IS very easy to switch. The problem is, it's too easy: it falls off. A lot. I read the directions and carefully tried to ""lock"" it onto my laces. But I lost two separate sensors...one while walking in my neighborhood and the other while on a cruise ship deck. I was always picking it up after it fell off around the house or on the street. I do walk a mile or two almost daily, but I'm hardly a ""power user""...I don't run much and I'm not hiking in the backwoods. THe clips are not expensive, but the Nike plus sensors in the sport kit or with the new Nike plus sportsband aren't cheap. It just doesn't make sense to use this clip and risk losing the sensor. The best choice: the velcro-driven Marware sportsuit sensor case, currently on Amazon at $9.99. Velcros right onto your shoe laces. Easy, secure. And no, I don't work for Marware. There is always some slight accuracy loss with all these clips, but they make so much sense because they allow flexibility with your workout shoe purchase AND what particular shoes you want to wear that day -- especially important if you wear waterproof/cleat walking shoes in the rain and ice.",negative
"I got this for my job where I frequently need to change out radio batteries/ radios as part of day-to-day work.

In an emergency situation this isn't good and so I'm not really too thrilled with the product honestly because I can't really efficiently change it out. I bought a backup holster just in case even though I prefer a clip because I just can't trust this product.",negative
"It looks nice in pictures, and I think it is in fact an attractive item. However, in the picture, do you see how far the credit cards are inserted into the pocket? The pocket doesn't go all the way down, and that's exactly how far a CC will go in. Notice how the card partially covers one of the snaps. You can't snap it closed once a card is [partially!!!] inserted in the pocket. You can fold up a few dollar bills and put it in the pocket, and then snap it, but that's all the ""wallet"" portion is good for. This is not an exaggeration, it's just too small to use. It has one magnetic snap, but the other two snaps are very tight. To avoid damaging the phone, you need to take your phone out before you can exert the pressure required to open the snaps on the wallet section. I suspect those who describe it positively, are just looking at it, and haven't tried to use it yet. On the one I received, the magnetic clasp was not centered properly on the flap. I have to twist it funny to get the two flaps to line up so it will snap shut, then it remains distorted. Maybe others don't have this problem. Unfortunately its just not worth the shipping to send it back. I think I'll wrap it up, and give it as a gift to someone I don't like. ;)",negative

"First off, this is a great phone for many reasons. Read the five-star reviews if you want a glowing perspective. I agree with aspects of all of them. If you are coming from the Treo 600/650 series, however, which allows you pretty much complete control over the phone's behavior, has fairly strong vibration, AND is a decent PDA, this phone will frustrate you to no end. Example: Let's say the only time you want this phone to make a (speaker-based) noise is when a call is coming in. Sorry - not possible. If you have your phone set to make an audible ring, and you DON'T want it to give you an error beep (which is incredibly loud) when you make a trivial ""mistake"" in the complex user interface, you are out of luck. I tried turning EVERYTHING off but the ring in the ""Normal"" profile, and I still get the error beep. It's louder than the ring, by the way - and does not seem affected by any volume control. The frustrating thing is that there are actually phone settings for turning off various alerts. E.g., ""Warnings,"" ""Questions,"" ""Exclamations."" All of these are set to off (you'd think an ""error"" would fall into one of those categories), and still I get thunderous error beeps. Note there is a vibrate-only mode (called Meeting) that doesn't beep for errors, but then you're stuck with its wimpy vibration. I can't feel the Q vibrate in any pocket. Maybe if I carry it between my teeth I'll be okay. Note that you don't actually have to make an error to get an error beep. Example: Enter an address in the browser, and press the RETURN key instead of the ""Go"" soft key. Both navigate you appropriately, but hitting RETURN gives you an error beep. It's like your phone is saying to you, ""You hit the wrong (yet completely intuitive and fully operational) key! BEEEEEP!!!"" Also, when you insert or remove the power cord: ""BEEEEP!!!"" Plus, in typical Microsoft style, you actually get a full-screen dialog when you pull out the cord. ""Charging is complete!"" it tells you, with a button to dismiss the message. ""Um, yes - I KNOW it's complete. I just freaking got out of bed and unplugged it. But thanks for scaring the life out of me."" If a calendar is important to you (as it is for most PDA users - probably the sole reason to cary one), I'd steer way clear of this phone. The interface for accessing, viewing, and creating appointments is cumbersome at best. Also, it's missing key functionality: E.g: I get my hair cut every other week; my cleaning service comes every other week; There is no way to set a recurring appointment for every other week! If you want a phone that's a real PDA, get the treo 650 or 700, even though it's heavier and fatter. I can only speak for the Palm OS version, which is excellent, usability-wise. After using this phone, I'm now nervous about the 700w - considering that phone and the Q both run on the same company's software. Needless to say, I'm returning mine.",neutral
"Hmmm? What can I say about the phone that everyone seems to want? The Motorola PEBL phone itself, is indubitably eye-catching. It offers exceptional operation & premium features. The PEBL is one of the most charming phones. Shaped like a river stone, it's attired in basic black & is nicely accessorized by a shiny metal hinge. I especially liked the oval shape, the rounded edges, and the rubbery textured feel of the casing is pretty nifty. It's very compact (3.4"" x 1.9"" x 0.8""; 3.8 ounces), and it has weight when it's in your hand. As for features... The phone book holds 1,000 contacts, each of which can take six phone numbers, an e-mail address, a postal address, and a birth date. I like that you can place photos with contacts for caller ID that are viewed on the internal screen. Contacts can be assigned one of 12 polyphonic or MP3's. I also appreciate the camera, vibrate mode, a one-minute voice recorder, voice dialing, calculator, calendar, alarm clock, text & multimedia messaging, PC syncing (my favorite!!), instant messaging ( with Yahoo, AOL, and/or ICQ), and a Web browser. You can personalize the PEBL with a variety of wallpapers, themes, menu styles, color skins, screensavers, and message tones. You can always download more depending on your service provider. Ok, now the bad. The PEBL has a low-resolution camera (whaaa), and a strange magnetic flip that is awkward to open with your thumb. The flip opens when dropped and can demagnetize credit cards. Would I buy the PEBL again? Yes. Would I recommend it to others? Sure. Who couldn't say 'yes' to such a looker?!!?!",positive

"I use this with my BlackBerry 7290. My primary motivation for buying the Motorola HF820 was that it would serve both as a car handsfree device while I was driving, and as a regular speakerphone for my blackberry 7290 at other times. Having used it for a couple of days, I would say it works satisfactorily but is not great. The voice quality could be better. You don't get a whole lot of controls other than basic volume and on/off buttons. One thing you might want to know: When your box arrives, you have to charge the device for 2 hours before you can start using it. Okay, you say. No big deal. Well, the annoying part is there's no wall charger included. I ended up buying an iGo charger ($29) from Radio Shack. It only ships with a car charger, perhaps because they expect you to use it in the car all the time.

Plantronics has been great about replacing each failed headset but it can get expensive when you start adding up the cost to ship each failed headset back to Plantronics. I'm now looking for a different headset...three strikes and you are out.,neutral
"Poor pairing signal. Sometimes I can make/receive calls, sometimes I get the ""two beeps,"" which means my device is having trouble connecting to my phone. Pretty frustrating. I've tried re-setting/ connecting the two devices multiple times, even to the point where I take the battery out of my cell phone --that sort of thing but nothing seems to make it work properly. But I shouldn't complain too much as I only paid $40 for it and it already seems way outdated. I only purchased it because I like the ear design. Buy something else.",negative

Pro: Good cover for the price I paid. con: The screen protectors was bent when I received the package and could not use it. Amazon was quick to refund 30% of cost of the product. I do not like the data cable socket being covered with silicon. It is bit of hassle to pull it out to access the socket every time you need to charge the phone. Outer plastic cover feels cheap.,neutral
"The sound is good, but the darn thing works its way out of my ear. If you touch it to push it back in, of course you end up hanging up the phone. Same thing if you are not wearing it and get a call. You'll grab it and end up hanging up on the person while you put it in your ear. So that's pretty frustrating.",neutral
This device is made if decent materials. The directions are poorly written and the diagrams are are almost impossible to understand. But keep working and you will eventually get this unit together and it should do just fine. You will almost certainly want some bungee cords to attach it to the seat rests.,neutral
My IPhone kept weighing down the mount which ultimately made the phone drop from the vent holder. Perhaps it is the clips which were not durable or perhaps it was the iphone which may be too heavy for the vents.,negative

"I purchased this Jabra stereo because a mono bluetooth would not work for my music and mobile tv with my VZW Voyager. It has great sound quality but as far as the 'mouthpiece' - it doesn't work so well. I also have to use the phone to make calls, although you can answer from the mouthpiece. Overall, great stereo quality but poor phone quality.",neutral
"This is a good shower head but it has a few design flaws. Firstly, it has a quarter inch lip before the threads start. That means using this shower head with a diverter is impossible as only 2 or 3 threads engage before it hits the body. I had to cut the lip off in order to get enough threads onto the diverter. Secondly, the threads are coarser than they should be and it doesnt have a seal at the base of the threads. That means you need to use a lot of plumber tape and put more torque than should be necessary on the threads to have the shower head seal properly and not leak. If you plan to use this head without a diverter then it will work for your, just use a lot of plumber tape on the pipe coming out of the wall. Otherwise, its big and delivers a good volume of water, feels like its well put together. Personally, I think it looks a little ugly for the price but that's my opinion.",neutral
"This thing is a piece of garbage. Got it hardwired, and mounted...only to find out that the two 12V ports work, but the USB ports had no power. Since I had already hardwired it, I knew they'd never take it as a return. Don't waste your money.",negative
"Just find out my location is too remote to have good and stable signal to be boosted. This testing signal strenght way should be posted on amazon, so that people will make less error in purchasing.

After failing to install the product, call technech support, and they ask me to test the strenght of signal by entering *3001#12345#* call and read the number on upper left of my iphone. My reading is -103, -107, and then searching. They told me, -50 is under the cellphone tower, -108 will lost the connection. Hope this information is useful for others.",neutral

"I bought the Plantronics 510SL kit a few months ago to use a single headset while in the office and with my Sprint 6700 (Windows Mobile 5) and love it. The comfort on this headset is really great. I've used other Bluetooth headsets from Motorola and this is much more comfortable. It is also very clear even in the wind; the Motorola wasn't. I think this has to do with the arm and the wind phone protection. Very clear and easy to pair. In the office, I use this with an ancient AT&T 7406 phone on a PBX system. After a few hookups and adjustments, it works great. I have a co-worker who has an ancient monitor that was leaking electrical interference so I had to play with the position a little. But it works great now. The H10 lifter is great... I can use the button on the headset to answer calls in the bathroom if I want! I also use this headset with both a PC and a Mac to call people over Skype. Calls are very clear and people tell me that they cannot hear the difference from a regular phone.",positive

"My last Motorola phone was a Dynatac 8000G, and it worked great for years. A few months ago, I bought a Z6m and now hate not just the phone, but Motorola. (The Z6m is the CDMA variant; I've observed that all sorts of GSM phones regularly cause interference, violating US FCC rules part 15, and therefore unlawful to operate.) The first thing that infuriated me was the speakerphone. It isn't loud enough to use in a moving car, even when holding it near my head. (Under the same conditions, my old Nokia worked just fine, allowing me to keep both hands on the steering wheel.) The MP3 player can play plenty loud through the same speaker, indicating to me that it's not the fault of the speaker, but an intentional shortcoming designed to sell Motorola's hands-free car kit. Even while using all the power-saving options, I still can't get a second day's use out of the phone before recharging, and that's with a brand-new battery. My Nokia gave me a week. The phone supports adding a memory card only up to 2GiB because it uses FAT16 and not FAT32. It would be nice to offer a non-Microsoft file system, if only Motorola could get the disk interface right. Plug in a USB cable to a computer and it charges the phone, and allows access to the memory (card if installed or main if not) or the modem. See something you want to take a picture of? Hold down the button and wait. It launches the camera application, so wait some more. The moment is long gone. I went somewhere with no service and quickly learned that I couldn't even set the clock to the right time. Want to browse the Web? Forget it. The designs of many parts of this thing were outsourced and clearly not managed competently. This is the last Motorola product I buy. I feel ripped off, and hope to soon replace the phone and punch any of its designers in the nose.",negative

"Griffin's new case for the iPhone is supposed to be a twofer; a hard plastic case and an internal antenna that improves cell phone reception. How does it perform? The ClearBoost case is a two-piece (top and bottom) case that snaps together, encasing the iPhone snugly within. There's never a worry about the iPhone sliding out of the case, as can happen with slot-loading cases, as the two halves snap tightly together. In fact, you need a small screwdriver or a quarter to pop the two halves apart. However, the hard plastic case material, while tough, is slippery. I was immediately struck by how smooth the case was; there was no sense of tackiness or grippiness to the material. I used the ClearBoost for a couple of days, and had it accidentally slip out of my hands more than once. Also, there is no belt clip, so the iPhone will have to live in your pocket or purse. The main selling point of the ClearBoost case is improved cell phone reception. That's the ""boost"" in ClearBoost. Inside the bottom case is an unpowered antenna that sits firmly against the back of the iPhone outer shell when closed. I'm not enough of an electrical engineer to know how the induction works to transfer the signal from the ClearBoost's antenna to the iPhone, but Griffin says there is a marked improvement. Part of the review package is a white paper telling reviewers how to access the iPhone's Field Test Mode to measure the cell tower signal strength. I tapped in the code (*3001#12345#*) and went to Cell Information. I live a bowl-like depression in the foothills of the Catalina Mountains, in the northern part of Tucson, AZ. ATT's cell phone coverage is usable, but just barely. The reported signal strength without the case was barely within what Griffin calls ""usable."" Oddly, the audio quality is fairly good, and ATT coverage is better than Sprint, my previous carrier. I first noted the signal strengths without the ClearBoost from the five towers (uniformly poor), and then strapped the iPhone into the 'Boost. Hmmm, the signal strengths were almost identical, and the apparent call quality was unchanged. I went back to the reviewers guide, and found that other data from the towers showed that, in my location, ATT was using the 1900 mHz band. Unfortunately, the ClearBoost antenna is designed to work best with the 850 mHz band. It may have some small improvements for 1900 mHz signal, but not much compared to 850 mHz signals. Griffin says that ATT uses the 850 mHz band in most parts of the US. But Tucson appears to be all 1900 mHz. I tried the ClearBoost at Nemo's house, about five miles due west of my location, only to find that his area uses the 1900 mHz band, as well. I spent twenty minutes on the ATT web site, trying to discover what parts of the US use 850 or 1900 mHz, and could not find any information. I suspect it's there, but I couldn't dig it up. Is the ClearBoost right for you? I'm not really able to comment on how well the antenna works in the 850 mHz band, so I can't say yea or nay. Antenna performance aside, the case is too slippery, and needs a belt clip. MyMac.rating 2.5 based mostly on the case's slipperiness.",negative
"The Bluetooth itself works very well. Clear loud and easy to use. Everything you could want in a Bluetooth device. However, just like the other Blue Ant Bluetooth devices. They refuse to manufacture the ""small"" ear buds. They do not carry them for separate order either. This eliminates MANY people from using this quality device. I know at least five people who have purchased Blue Ant devise and two of them returned them and one just plain and simply doesn't use it, and it is all for the same reason. They don't fit in their ear properly, not quality of the product. 3 out of 5 is a pretty bad ratio! If it was not for the ear buds I would have given this Bluetooth 5 out of 5 stars. Quality wise it is the best Bluetooth I have ever owned or used and I have owned 2 different Jawbone, 2 different Motorola, and one Samsung. The Blue Ant beats them all in call clarity (on both the sending and receiving ends), noise cancellation (which surprised me because everyone I talked to said I would never find anything better than the Jawbone's noise cancellation, and yes I do know how to properly use Jawbones noise cancellation!!) ease of use, and battery time. Too bad I guess.....",neutral
"This might not be as good a deal as it first appears, so watch out! While the phone is cheap, if you buy it from Cingular, you are locked in for 2 years and must have a minimum plan of $40 a month, plus $45 a month in Blackberry service charges. That's $85 a month! T-mobile offers what appears to me to be a far more competitive plan including voice and Blackberry data for $65. Admittedly, they don't sell or officially support the 8700c, but if you can get an unlocked one, it'll work. I'm not sure if Cingular offers a service superior enough to justify the additional price, but am currently using T-mobile and considering switching, so I'd appreciate any comments/advice!",neutral

"The technology couldn't be better. Bluetooth conecteivity is simple to establish. The overall physical design is excellent. Though it looks heavy, the unit is a featherweight and fits nicely around the ear. Long-term wearing is comfortable. Audio fidelity is excellent. Where the unit fails badly, though, is the controls. They do not provide enough tactile input. You cannot be certain of where the volume control is or which end of the rocker switch increases or decreases the volume. Since the volume defaults to moderately low setting, this means you are likely to miss the first words of whatever your caller is saying which in turn means a lot of asking ""what did you say?"". The Call Control button handles at least four different functions. On a phone equipped to handle all four functions, it is easy to mistakenly select a function. For example, on my phone, if I hold the Call Control button a fraction too long, the call is not answered, but the prompt to enter a Voice Speed Dial entry is actuated. No fun when you are trying to answer a call. Plantronics provides three earpiece inserts and it's unlikely that one of them won't provide a comfortable, snug fit. Overall, excellent technology marred by poor ergonomics. Jerry",neutral

"This is the third ""Motorola"" headseat carrying case I have bought... My husband used one till he wore it out, lost the second one (along with the headset) and the first two were actual Motorola branded products. This says it is Motorola in the title ""Malcom Distributors Headset EVA Carrying Pouch Case MD BLT-04 compatible with Motorola H500 H550 H670 H700 H710 H715 H721 H730 HS850 H350 H300 H3 HS820 HS810 Bluetooth Headset by Motorola"" (copied and pasted that directly from this page).... but instead of the signature M like in the photo (and I believed I was getting that because of the ""by Motorola""), the actual case I received has ""MD"" on it and is much cheaper made than the previous cases. If it says ""by Motorola"", you would logically conclude that Malcom Distributors are a Motorola distributor, and the ""compatible with Motorola H500 H550 ..."" etc., is just telling you which Motorola headsets will fit this case. When I clicked on ""Review this product"" and started typing, the photo next to the product name is the photo of the actual case I received, with the MD on it. This is the kind of business practice that leads me to question whether the company can be trusted. It could be an oversight, but I don't believe so, if the stock photo of a Motorola case was all that was used, it would be easier to believe that the company is not trying to make customers believe they are getting a branded Motorola product. I wanted the actual Motorola case, because I have used that exact product before and knew it's quality, I have nothing against knock-off brands as long as they are well made enough to suit my needs, I don't believe this one will hold up well for very long. The security tab and velcro seem to be super flimsy. I am not happy with Malcolm Distributors.",negative
"I often put my iPhone in my back pocket. The expensive screen protectors from the AT&T store lasted for an average of about a month each. None of these stayed on more than a week.

"I had the Nextel i730 for 8 months then i just couldn't take it anymore. To be honest the phone is a easy phone to get attached to. But recently i upgrade to the i850 and iam very very happy i did. The i730 is a phone / radio. The color screen is on par with all other free phones that are usually FREE. So basicly the screen is not impressive at all. The phone comes with features, but to be honest it took me about 2 months to figure out how to use all of them on,( NOT USER FRIENDLY AT ALL) and by that time i had lost faith in the phone itself. It's heavy, very heavy, and thick. On the good side, it' sorta stylish and its very durable, this is what i loved about it. I dropped the phone so many times and it has very little exterior damage. I look at this phone like, a army tank, versus my newer i850 which i just upgraded to, and thats more like a convertable BMW. The i850 is a phone that you just have to have a leather case on it, because it looks so good, that you don't wanna risk it gettings scratched, this on the other hand, there's no need to case it, because the exterior is that solid. I'm a 23 year old male out of atlanta ga. As far as reception, the calls on the i730 are very clear, the speaker phone is awesome, you can almost set the phone in one room and talk at a leisure tone on the other side of the room and the caller will hear you fine, which is cool. But to be honest i can only say this phone would fit someone who is not looking for alot bells and whistles, Not a person between the ages of 16-21, bad idea. This phone is for people who want a phone that can handle just about anything, ie construction worker. Another good thing about this phone is it'is nearly impossible to lose, due to its weight. When you have the i730 on the hip swivle thing, it feels like you've got a gun on ur hip, or a flash light, its that heavy. Plus with it being 2006 and all, this phone is getting very dated, by the end of the year this phone is going to be classified as a dinosaur. If you can get it for free, go for it, but if your paying money, trust me, dish out a few extra bucks and go with the i850, the i850 is the honest to god best cell phone ive ever owned, and ive had 15+ cells.",neutral

The people on the other end of the calls couldn't even hear the wind blowing when I was driving with the windows down!

"I purchased my first Razr in September 2005. December 2005 a black screen with a lot of numbers and codes appeared. I could not use the phone at all. Two or three weeks later Motorola sent the repaired phone back. Last week, June 2006, my ""new"" phone started with the black screen, numbers and codes. I contacted Motorola and Cingular about the problem. I received another phone in 2 days (I paid for the speedy delivery). The bottom line is even though the phone is less than a year old, if I have problems with the new phone, I will get a replacement phone that has been refurbished. The Cingular service rep said that I could not get another phone at this time. They know that the phone is a lemon. I absolutely hate Cingular service and policies. I wish they had some serious competition down here. The other companies are a joke in this area. They are worse than Cingular. I like the size and weight of the Razr, but it would be a bonus if it actually worked.",negative
"I was able to get this to work out of the box with my Blackberry 8703e from Sprint, but soon I had the dreaded dropped calls or no audio. Since then it has not worked at all with the 8703e and I've had to return it. The sound when it did work was incredible compared to the Motorola HS850 and the Jabra BT250.

The issue is evidently with the phone and not the headset, but I have to put in my 2 cents for those looking at this for the 8703e.",neutral
"I would agree with reviewers that rate this speaker phone 1 or 2 stars. You can buy a much cheaper speaker phone that works just as well, which I would say is Mediocre. It works fine if there's no road noise, but as soon as you hit the freeway your callers are all saying what, what! and for some reason I also found the volume on my end going up and down to the point that I was saying what all the time too. I called my home phone several times and left test messages and what I herd when I got home and listened to the test was the audio had a distortion and a quivering quality to it like you would hear with a real cheep digital voice recorder.

Pros: Motorola H 98689 T820 Bluetooth Stereo Headset is an excellent Bluetooth Stereo Headset I have used. The Audio quality is superb both while hearing Music and talking over phone. The back of the head and over the ear design is very comfortable and sits in its place even during a workout in Gym or while running or Walking.

I've read through many descriptions of fake ones in the internet, and the one they shipped me (1)came with an ear holder. The real Samsung ones do NOT come with an ear holder, (2) has a charger with no label at all (if you check out the one the guy shows on the video review, his says Samsung on the top of the charging box), (3)did not come with a user manual.

"So I have had a V3i noir for a long time. It was quite the fashion statement when it first came out in mid 2000s. Unfortunately my phone finally gave up and died last month. Despite already having an iPhone, I realized I can not really live without my V3i, so I ordered another one from this seller. Bottom line, this is NOT the original phone released by Motorola. Everything about is off and feels cheaply made and they haven't even made any efforts to make it look legit. For example the user manual is quite clearly made by stapling a bunch of black and white photocopied sheets! And as another reviewer mentioned, the battery looks completely random, perhaps recycled with a sticker glued on it. I have contacted the seller for a refund and I will update this review to tell you about the customer service.",negative

"I love the PDA, I love the internet access and email. Typing is easy using their suretype concept. Two warnings -- Blackberry and Gmail don't always work together (blackberry says they can't fix it - it's cause Gmail is beta). Also, big issue is that the microphone quality on the phone is real below average -- I've had many many people complain that they cannot understand my words (moving mouth back kinda helps). Use of 2 different headsets and two different phones does not really fix this. Sum is I find I use the whole phone less, which is ultimately a hassle. Tmobile support says I'm not the only one who's noted this problem. I wish I could give them the extra $5 it probably costs RIM to put a average quality mic in the unit, but alas.....",neutral

"I have a first-run Jawbone, and I like it very much: lightweight, compact, handsome, etc. But what is the story with the metal they used to make the earloops? They fit quite well, once you've (carefully) nudged the metal into the shape that works best, staying away from the connection to the unit. But the metal is not very malleable, and thin at the connection to the unit: sooner or later the stem breaks right at the connection to the set. I am very careful with my stuff: no tight pockets, no bottom of the briefcase, but I have now gone through 8 earloops. And now they are no longer making the loops for the 1st edition Jawbones.

"After reading all the reviews I ordered the BlueAnt Supertooth 3 for my daughter. First pairing went well with an LG Vu, only wouldn't download the contacts, nor would it announce that it was not able to do so. Call clarity was fantastic on my end but the caller complained about feed back and a gargling noise. So I decided to pair it with my HTC Pure thinking it was just the phone. After struggling to pair it with the second device, the call clarity on the other end only improved slightly. Incomming calls fought with the HTC Pure on whether to use my contacts on BlueAnt S3 or the phone to announce it's own contact.

You have to push ""OK"" and select the number from the called list; -The belt clip needs a stronger spring to prevent accidental dropping; -Awkward delay on push button; It is still a good phone because: -The construction is tough. I've dropped it many times and it is still going strong; -It comes with a standard earphone receptacle so you do not have to rely on the Bluetooth ear phone; -The speaker phone function works well and is very useful; -The main battery on the phone last more than a day of heavy usage; I hope they pay attention to the details in the next version.

"I've been impressed by the windshield lock-grip of Garmin Nuvi units and even by the effectiveness of a 9-dollar silly-looking gooseneck that not only held my iPod in place but charged it and served as reliable FM transmitter to boot. This latter item item didn't score well with other Amazon customers--proof that you can't always trust the ratings. In the case of this ""Universal Car Vent or Dash Mount Holder,"" you can trust the consumer ratings--in fact, they may even be a bit high. The device is branded as a ""Cellet"" universal mount in the title, but in the description it's referred to as a ""Luxmo"" universal mount. No matter. A poorly designed piece of plastic is--by any name--a potentially useless piece of plastic. The idea here is that you can, if you choose, unscrew the base and toss it so that it's not in the way of the bracket, which you then are supposed to insert in any convenient ""vent."" Unfortunately, my air vents were either too narrow or too wide to accept the bracket, or ""Vent Mount (non)solution."" So it was on to Plan B, the ""Dash Mount"" solution (at least it's a versatile little fellow). But the base for this kitschy piece of curious clutter is no more than a single square inch. Moreover, I had kept the unit for over a year before deciding to give it a try. So not only was the sticky substance spread over too small a foundation: it was no longer sufficiently sticky to hold in place my iPod Touch even if the surface area were a whole foot! Here's where I was spared the worst nemesis of every neophyte--i.e. making a bad thing worse by trying to make it better. In other words, I was about to get out the Crazy Glue and muck up my otherwise clean dashboard when it struck me that maybe I ought to see if this ""adjustable"" guy actually would clasp my iPod as advertised. Upon pressing the button for releasing the spring and extending the gizmo's right arm, nothing happened. His right arm was jammed (and the left is clearly non-adjustable). Since he obviously needed a helping hand, I gave him one. Unfortunately, my gentle tugging pressure was enough to snap off that piece of plastic on the right side of this holder with the (non) ""Adjustable Grip."" Mercifully, the experience came to an end before I'd given this low-(but over)priced imposter a chance to show its stuff. But even more fortunately, I can now put this review to rest.

"I've had this up and running for about a month. It works somewhat as advertized - it seems to work really well at giving your phone a ton of bars (1 to 2 prior and now 4 to 5), but the call quality doesn't seem to match the signal strength. There are spots in my apartment that used to be completely dead, but now I'm able to at least place calls. The call quality seems to be only as good as where the antenna is place - not necessarly ""boosting"" the signal. Everything you need is in the box, which is a plus, but should be expected if your dishing out $300/$400 for something like this. If it wasn't so expensive, I'd probably sing a different song about it, but for the money, it's only OK. Good if you're desperate to get a signal in your house/apt. -n-",neutral
"First of all make sure you understand that this is the bean bag only and the mount arm that comes with the Garmin gps will not work with it and you cannot buy the mount arm seperately. The bag works ok, I have a Chevy Silvarado pickup and the dash is sloped. The bag does slide forward once in a while and will definately slide forward if you slam on the brakes. It would be nice if Garmin included some sort of adjustable hook that would fit over the front of the dash that would keep it from sliding forward.",neutral
I purchased this with hopes of using it to listen to my music on my Blackberry Pearl - I guess I should have done more research. According to Samsung - this particular unit is basically just for sending/recving phone calls. In that aspect - it works well. I haven't had any complaints from people regarding sound and I can hear everything just fine. The fit is a bit of a concern - don't move your head around too much or it's gone.,neutral
"Ive had this phone for a couple of years and it's great, I get service almost everywhere.. The only things I don't like about it is that when I get a call I have to open it to see who it is, I wish it had a display screen on the outside, thats one thing I don't like. Also I don't like that I cant get any ringtones I like... you can only pick out of what is already there(and to me they all aren't good.). Texting is also great its fast and easy, but still the cost gets you... To buy the Minutes for it is a hassel, they are hard to find, not very many stores carry Net10 products, for how many minutes you get for the price its ok. Like, usually I'll buy 300 minutes - $30.00, which isn't bad, but its still not alot of minutes for that much money. And they go very fast especially if you talk alot like me. But as for service, it is great! Honestly I wouldnt recommend this phone, unless you like very simple things. I hope this helps!! :)",neutral
"This product is not made very well. The top cover that protects the screen has a side piece which is supposed to clip on to the phone. It clips on but it is so thin that the piece breaks off which leaves you with the back piece only. I ordered 3, one came in defective, I called the number on the receipt to Bargain Cell, they did send me a new one but it was also defective. I called again and no response. Now I have 2 cases that only the back piece clips on. I am would not purchase this product again.",negative
"I just bought this to replace the BT800 I have. I was after something that fits more securely and is not as heavy (the 800 is like trying to hang a brick from your ear with a rubber band). The 250V is definitely more comfortable, but that's all. It is far inferior in all other aspects. The range is claimed to be 30 feet. I get maybe 1 foot before static is unbearable. I might as well use the headset if I have to hold it next to my ear anyway! Also, this may be a quirk of the phone that I use (motorola v330), but when this headset is turned on, it immediately triggers the voice name function which I have to kill. I could live with that if the range was better... Tomorrow I am returning it. I am going to try the motorola models next.",negative
"GOOD: Very comfortable to wear for long periods (I never once needed the over-the-ear loop thing), sound clarity is fantastic even in loud places, looks very sleek. BAD: 1) Because of the lack of visible buttons, it's difficult to tell at a glance if it's on, linked to your phone, and if the battery needs a charge. You have to wait until it blinks next (or doesn't), and that's a long few seconds if you're in a hurry. I was constantly guessing wrong. 2) The part that's supposed to touch your cheek would often slip off mine as my jaw moved in conversation, and the person I was talking to would lose me, and I'd have to move it back; 3) After about six months of moderate use, it first got stuck in the ""on"" position (which screwed up the pairing and un-pairing after every charge) and then broke entirely. OVERALL: Worked great when it worked, but ultimately didn't justify its buzz and price tag, and I won't be buying it again.",neutral
works as promised,neutral
"I have only used for a couple of days. My application is with a Samsung A640 phone. In the car, I simply had to turn the volume up two steps to overcome the ambient noise. The audio quality seemed equivalent to my phone. With the headset in my right ear, I tried positioning the phone in my left pants pocket, my shirt pocket, and the center console. There was no perceived degradation in the quality of the signal. At home, I pushed the distance limits a bit more. While charging my phone, I walked to different parts of the house. Sound quality was acceptable until I was about 20 feet away with a wall in-between. I never lost the signal, but it crackled a bit. My previous headset was a wired Jabra with the ear gels. While Jabra does not advertise such, I found that the ear gel fits reasonably well onto the BT2010 earpiece. I liked using the ear gel better than the over-the-ear clip. Your head may vary. I wore the headset this way for over 6 hours, which is probably the limit for my comfort. This a very light-weight, simple, inexpensive, and effective solution for somebody that just wants to turn it on and go. A single charge lasted for over 6 hours of talk time, plus some standby time, before indicating that it was low. The charger connector has the shape of a USB ""B"" (smaller) connector. I have not confirmed if it would take a charge by connecting to a PC, though.",positive

"I shopped around for the perfect Pet Barrier for about a month. I narrowed my search down to this one and another Mesh Barrier. I ordered the other barrier and it never came in stock. That was a blessing in disguise as this barrier was less expensive and has exceeded my expectations. I have a 2001 Subaru Forester and this barrier is a perfect fit in the hatch compartment. I did not have any trouble assembling and installing the barrier. So far, it does not rattle and is serving its purpose very well. It gets warm in the hatch compartment as there are no air vents and my hatch door window doesn't roll down. I purchased a stainless steel crate bowl to attach to the mesh as well as two large battery operated crate fans. A plush SUV cargo pad was a great finishing touch for my dog's new hangout.",positive
"Working in remote areas in the oil field we run into a lot of areas without service. Not only is it inconvenient to not be able to call out, but it isn't safe.

The thing seemed to work fine in one room of my home, but when I walked to the next room (about 15 feet) the static was unbelievable. The hand set is miserably small and awkward to use. The headset is uncomfortable and provides no possibility of adjustment to make it more comfortable. A bad, bad, bad design of both components.

"First let me state that I was more than pleasantly surprised by the honesty and integrity of Zena Mobile and their staff. Unfortunately the original cell-phone I received had a back cover which would not stay latched and fell off at inopportune moments.

I would definitely not hesitate to recommend this company and I will most certainly do business with them in the future. I owned a Motorola RAZR that unfortunately was accidentally broken. I was more that happy with my old RAZR and still under contract with my service provider. Since I could not find one locally, I purchased this one through Amazon and in doing so found another great company, Zena Mobile, to do business with.",positive

"Dear Amazon, I used to be able to jump all over the car whenever my dad took me for a ride. But then one day I accidentally bonked the baby and my dad said he was getting a ""barrier"" so I wouldn't do that anymore. I didn't know what a ""barrier"" was, so I just assumed it was food. Not only did your shipment arrive a day earlier, but it was definitely not food, even more to my disappointment. I had some entertainment as my dad puzzled over the directions. He said something about poorly-illustrated diagrams and used a few uh-oh words, but when he was done, I didn't like the way this looked. He went out to our Jeep Patriot, and after about 5 minutes came inside and put my leash on and told me we were going bye-bye in the car. I LOVE THE CAR!!! MY FAVORITE THING!!! He loaded me in the cargo area... Ha! Like I'm going to stay THERE! -Except now this ""barrier"" thing was sitting right against the backseat. Dad stopped the car and hopped out to pump gas. Much to my dismay, I could no longer hop over the seats to scrounge for any cereal or crackers the baby had dropped. Nor could I sit in Dad's seat and pant and drool all over his steering wheel. I'm not an overly-active dog, but it's pretty solidly in place; I don't think I could get past this without weighing an extra 50 pounds and making a serious effort. *sigh* all those crackers are just going to go to waste when Dad vacuums out the car now. I hate this barrier, but for what it's worth, my dad likes it... although he said the instructions could have been better. Because they made him say a few uh-oh words, I decided to give this 4 stars instead of 5. -Max the dog PS: Is it possible for me to exchange this for ham?",positive

"This has been my longest lasting holster for a Blackberry, so far. Over 2 years and counting. To me, 'wearing' a Blackberry is second-nature, having had one attached to may waist for more than 10 years now, so I may be as good as getting my Blackberry in an out if its holster as a gunslinger is with his gun. There's a lot I like about this holster and here I'm putting it down in a list: - makes it easy to get the Blackberry out or lock it in quickly - professional-looking black leather - the rubberized sides make it hold the BB tight - strong magnetic locking - VERY strong, really - swivel is okay, makes it easier to clip/unclip the holster - solid, strong build - like I said, I've been wearing this one almost daily for more than 2 years and it doesn't show signs of breaking or cracking yet Two so-so or interesting remarks. First, I agree with another reviewer that it's not so friendly to love handles. I can't say that I have them but, in the summer, when my employer (thank you employer) allows me to dress very casually, the clip sometimes presses into my skin. This is not a problem at all during other seasons because I have something tucked in my pants then so the clip does not touch the skin directly. Secondly, it's the magnetic lock. It's so strong, it will pick up small metallic objects such as paperclips and even larger ones if they happen to be near. Overall, I am happy with this holster and I'm likely to be using it for a while longer. It's a 5-star.",positive
"The speaker on this phone is too quiet, you can't open it with one hand, and it doesn't have a lot of bells and whistles. The only thing I like about it is that it is fairly sturdy.

Surfing around, these Li-Ion batteries are a fortune...as much as I paid for the entire functioning machine, with a power supply and dock. Amazon to the rescue! It looks OEM, and while it did not have a charge when I received it, which I did not expect, it was full after about 90 minutes on the dock. The fit is perfect, and I've extended this laptop's life by several years. Shipping was rather quick, too...and free. Tough to beat that.",positive

"If you are going to need a cell phone while traveling in Europe for emergencies, you will not find a better service.

If you want a US based number, incoming texts are only .15 and incoming calls are .30 cents a minute which is still a good deal for a international pre-paid plan. Outgoing calls start at .99 cents a minute and outgoing texts are .75 cents, but this phone is not made for people who will be making a lot of outgoing calls while traveling.

"I have tried many bluetooth Earphones to use while jogging or driving in autos without dedicated bluetooth A2DP connection capability, and found all of them lacking is something. The Jabra BT-3030 is the best of the lot that I have looked at. Initially I had a little bit of fading in/out while jogging, but that now seems to be solved by keeping the unit well charged and proper positioning of the cell phone and the BT-3030. My primary use has been listening to audio books. The controls are easy to understand and fully functional. It is easy to pause the book when outside (traffic) noise gets too loud and restart after the trucks pass. The volume controls are easy to use to compensate for background noise level changes. The one time that I have received a phone call while listening to the books functioned flawlessly. The book was automatically paused, the call was easy to pick up, caller reported reasonable audio level, and the book automatically restarted when the call was terminated. The included headphones are adequate and the design is perfect for use in a single ear while driving or jogging in a congested area and easily adapts to two ears when you want to immerse yourself in the book. Overall, I highly recommend this system, especially for those who do not like the look of a stick (or ???) stuck to their ear.",positive

"Comfort: My main problem with this headset was that it is not very comfortable on my ear. When I first got it, I couldn't wear it for more than 5-10 minutes. Now that my ear has become accustomed to it, I can wear it for an hour or so. It just takes getting used to. However, I wish I could rotate the headset without rotating the earhook like some bluetooth headsets. In order to have the headset have a tight grip on my ear (and not fall off), I have to rotate the headset so that it points upwards towards my eyebrows instead of downwards towards my mouth. It's not really an inconvenience per se, but it looks pretty uncool. Perhaps I have misshapen ears. Audio: The sound is fantastic. Only sometimes does it get staticky in my pocket, and not often enough to notice, at least on my end. Ease-of-Use: This headset was easy to pair with my Motorola KRZR and the main things I do (hanging up, answering calls, and adjusting volume) are simple and intuitive. Only problem is that if you don't hold buttons for the correct length of time, it can perform the wrong function. For example, pressing the call button once activates voice dialing, for 1 second redials your last call and 3 seconds turns it off. I've done my share of accidentally redialing. Battery: I was disappointed when I learned the battery wasn't rechargeable and it instead uses a AAA battery, but the lifetime is very long. It's supposedly 30 hours or so. I can't verify that, I just know I've been using it for two months now without replacing it, and it's just a regular Energizer battery. Durability: I carry this around in my jacket pocket most of the time and it holds up well. I do find myself accidentally turning it on when I lean against something, but I just need to be more careful.",positive

My Motorola E815 has this device on the list but for some reason keeps asking for the password. This is the only device out of 3 paired on my phone that does this. Because the mike is so close to the earpiece, feedback can be heard sometimes. This device is good when using it at home in QUIET surroundings. When I used it in a upscale restaurant, it picked up everything and the other person had trouble hearing me. Do yourself a favor and get a Logitech windstopper bluetooth for $40. It works much better.",negative
"I drive a diesel truck to jobs sites then grind metal with various grinding machines. This B 250 BlueParrott works flawlessly. No one knows I am using a blue tooth nor can they hear the back groung noise! I have tried 2 different Motorolas including the H12, and 2 different Jawbones. I have talked to other blue tooth users and I get the same opinion: They are just okay. I have to talk to important clients all day to maintain business dealings; with all other blue tooths I used, I had to stop what I was doing to talk, and 70% of the time I had to switch over to the phone because of bad sound quality. With this B 250 the sound quality is as good as when I am on a land line! Don't believe me, just try one! I couldn't believe it either. After I started using this blue tooth I quickly got tired of asking people how I sounded because the answer was always the same, perfect (even with alot of back ground noise). I own an LG 8600 phone and the voice commands work flawlessly also. I can go over two days of constant phone calls without a charge which is nice. I have walk approx. 30 feet from my phone during a call without any distortion (have not tested the claimed 66' yet; what more do you want). I just hope this product lasts a long time.

"My old RAZR V3 lost its screen (went black), and I was just not ready to be forced to pay AT&T for a data plan, nor did I want to yield to the pressure to get a smart phone. So, I tried to replace it with a new RAZR, but AT&T no longer offers it as an option. I ordered from a third-party reseller at Amazon, and I noticed that there was something different about the phone when it arrived. The keyboard-screen articulation was not as tight as my old one, and the keys on the side of the screen jiggled. It just felt like it was more shoddy manufacture. Something to do with the fact that the logo on the back says ""China Mobile"" instead of ""AT&T"" perhaps... As I have been using it, I noticed that the Bluetooth connection is not as robust (the headset sporadically disconnects), and I can no longer use Bluetooth to sync with my Mac (it says ""Connection with device lost""). The firmware is a bit different, but I'm getting used to it. The mini screen on the outside went black for about 2 days, but is now back--does not bode well. Overall, I'm glad to have a RAZR again, but I feel tentative about the quality of this one.

"I purchased this product for my sister for her birthday because she travels a lot and needs to be handsfree. Unfortunately, the product didn't work as she needed it to. She couldn't hear anyone she called when she was driving on the highway. They could hear her, but she couldn't hear them. This could be attributed to the manufacturing of her car and too much interior noise due to leaking air through windows or doors, but still there should be some way to turn the device up to account for that. She was disappointed.",neutral
"The workmanship is a bit sloppy. a) I can see the hot glue in the crack between plastic and wood, b) the plastic itself is a bit chipped on the sides (tiny but nevertheless noticeable), c)sloppy job on carving and polishing the plastic itself. I've got the white plastic with the bamboo wood. Bamboo is raw, not laminate it. I don't really mind but I'm afraid to think what will happen to it if some water gets on the case. After all, we buy cases to protect the phones, not cases themselves. If it was $5, I wouldn't mind it but since it's about $17 and change + non-prime shipping fee, I don't think it's worth it.",negative

Ear pieces shorted out after a year of use. Not sure what the life of these is supposed to be. But I figured I would try them again as I liked the headset and the range was good.

I got a great deal on this 9.99 for my PS3 and it has issues with volume with me not being able to hear the other players. I think I was a little muffled to them too. Also a little buzz in the ear. It is a ok set to game with but was not comfortable for me at all. I went to a Plantronics.,neutral
"The 1st time I used Our Signal Booster it worked great. Cell phone went from 2 bars to 4 bars for both voice and 3G data (Verizon). Laptop Verizon AirCard went from about 500 Kbps to 1000 kbps download speeds. Very nice! However, the second time I used it, I tried pointing the high power antenna out a window on the opposite side of the house to see if there was a closer cell site. I followed the directions, including making sure the low power antenna was greater than 20 feet away and pointed towards the high power antenna before turning on. This time, it initially showed a green light, then a red light and the light faded. I moved the low power antenna further away from the high power antenna and tried again. This time the light didn't come on anymore. I tried moving things to the way everything worked the very 1st time, but no light would come on. It was using power, because the low power unit was getting warm. The coax connection point was also getting really warm. But, it was no longer boosting the signal (no change in cell phone bars). It seems to have gone dead! We contacted the company (who seems very nice)and they said they will do a warranty replacement of the amplifier. We will update with details!

I would love my case and give it five stars if only you could attached it on the right side so it opens up the opposite way. I am a lefty and it would be nice if someone thought of us for a change. Making the case reversible would be easy enough. If you try to reverse it, the cover does not close all the way.",negative

"I've had this phone for a couple of weeks now & I've found it has a lot of good points, but coming from someone who's used to Motorolas, I've been missing quite a few things with this phone. First, it does have the 3G network which is amazing for super fast web browsing. I can't imagine going back to the old way. Everything loads within seconds. I love that you can rotate the camera, but that can be a nuisance if it was pointing one way & then you need to reverse the image to change it for later pictures. I was disppointed with the quality of the pictures though. I had better pics w/the Razr. I took a few pictures & sent them to a friend & he was only able to see 1. This phone has a lot of great options, but you have to pay for nearly all of them. For example, to watch tv clips from channels like TLC & Animal Planet, you need to pay $10/month; for HBO it's $5/mo. And those are only few minute clips-- not a whole show. For the radio it's another montly charge. You could easily rack up a bill for hundreds of dollars a month just to utilize all of these features on top of paying a regular phone bill. The ringtones were a big disappointment. Unlike the Razr where you can apply different rings to different things (i.e. vibrate for texts, ring for calls, etc), there is no way to have vibrate only. You can only do it before ringing or while ringing (or just plain silent) & if you have it silent, it's silent for everything--calls, texts, etc. The ringtones provided were awful. Before I got it, I checked out the other reviews & saw people wrote this too. I figured how bad could they really be?? They're bad. Bad! There's only one that actually sounds like a phone (it's called old ring) but even that's just ok. THe others are like weird, annoying songs. Very odd. I noticed the battery life is so so. I charge it about every other day & I don't even use the phone that much. If I were to make calls or use the internet, I'd have to charge it every night. I haven't gotten any dropped calls or weird variances in volume although I have found myself often straining to hear what the other person is saying. However, I've not found the calls to start out loud & gradually get lower as someone else mentioned. It's nice to be able to change the internal & external displays. You can have one image for the inside screen & another for the outside. They only provide you with 3 or so wallpapers (no screensavers) but you can use your own anyway. The screen goes black pretty quickly if you're not doing something every second. First the key lights go off & then the screen dims then goes black pretty quickly. I find that a little annoying. Storing numbers was a hassle as well. I liked the way the Razr worked in terms of this a lot better. It would show you distinguishable icons next to the person's name so you could just see what device you wanted right away. This one works a little differently & it's not as easily noticeable. All in all I think this isn't such a bad phone. I'm most likely going to get the Apple iphone when it comes out in June so just to use this phone for 3-4 months is fine. I'm sure I'll be over it by then anyway. If you don't need a ton of bells & whistles, then I'm sure you'll be happy with this phone.",neutral

This purchase was a total waste of money. Can't tell any difference at all in phone reception. Unfortunately I threw the box away that it came in so I own it now. Would never recommend this to anyone.,negative
I am very impressed with this device. I spend 5-6 hours a day on the road. Initially purchased it for mobile email which it does a great job of delivering. With ClearVue I've been able to handle doc review on the road which has been a great time saver. I just started using the phone for wmv playback since my iPod broke. Highly recommend this phone.,positive
I waited until using this a few months to make a review. I am overall very pleased. It has increased our signal significantly. Although We do not have a lot of trees and probably have a pretty clear shot to the tower. I don't know how much of a difference that makes. We also bought the cheaper version of this because we where not sure it if would work and are very happy. but if the weather is bad or it is real windy it does not work well.,positive

I regret purchasing it, becasue now im out 20 bucks, which i could have put towards a headset of better quality. i would suggest reading the reviews and take your time in choosing a headset. it worth the extra 30-50 dollars for a quality headset",negative
The case was shipped earlier than I expected considering it was shipped from Hong Kong. When I received the item it was slightly cracked in two places.

"POSITIVE: I have owned and used the BT 250 & BT 250v for almost 6 months each. I purchased the BT 500 10 days ago due to its size. The headset is much smaller than the 250 models. In addition, it has more functional answer/connect/volume buttons than the 250 models. I had pairing issues with the 250 models but not with the 500. So far, it always connects immediately, something that did not happen with the 250. The charger is a normal charger, and JABRA also offers an extra cable that fits into the USB mount of your computer/laptop, in case you want to charge it on the go...I don't understand the negative comments about the chargers by some other reviewers (unless they have an older package). NEGATIVE: The headset does not come with extra gel replacements, something that the 250 versions had as standard, in 3 different lengths. Therfore, in case the eargel does not fit in your ear, you have to purchase extra gel replacements. The volume of the headset is much lower than the 250 versions, (always comparing the maximum volume setting both on the headset and the cellphone)...this means that in a noisy environment, you won't be able to hear very clearly. The 250 versions had very high volume, even in the smallest scale. I used the 250 at the second lowest setting, while now, I use the 500 at the highest setting; at these settings, the 250's volume was much higher, making conversations easy to listen. All the above headsets, were used with a Nokia 6610, so they are directly comparable. You can draw your own conclusions, taking into consideration the much higher price...hope this helps.",neutral
When I saw the demo video of how the Jawbone blocked out all of the outside noise I was impressed but skeptical. I along with 2 other in the office figured we would give it try. Good reason to be skeptical because none of the three perform anything like the video. It is a decent ear piece with good range but callers could still hear all outside noise. My opinion is you could buy a smaller more comfortable device for a lot less and get the same performance. It fails does it work my test.,negative
"The box arrived and looks exactly like the image provided. Quite handsome in its pleather glory. However, this is the part I don't ""get."" You have four items to plug in. Some are grounded (3 prong). The box isn't wide enough to accommodate nor hide a power strip. An extension cord run to it won't accommodate four plugs (fire hazard!). So, am running 4 cords through the box, down the back of the table to an extended outlet plug (you know, plug in a 3-outlet bar, plus the other outlet). Not as aesthetically pleasing as I had hoped (used to charge items in two different places). Now the table top is pretty, and the back and plug area look like a rat's nest.

I used it with a Motorola phone, and now with my TILT, and it works well enough to get the job done. It does not impress me however. The main issue I have is the lack of volume. It just won't put out enough sound to use in a car, mall, or other place with back-ground noise. I added a couple more holes for sound to come through from the speaker, but it is not enough. Now, it has lost the ability to hold a charge, so I will need to find a new battery, or a new BT device. For the money, I really expected it to kick a little more but-t. A such, I give it a middle-of-the-road rating.",neutral

"!!!THIS REVIEW ONLY APPLIES TO THE VERIZON WIRELESS MODELS!!! As a former owner of this phone, and several others, I know that this phone is terrible! In fact, all Verizon Wireless Phones today are terrible; and I am waiting for my contract to run out to switch. I am currently using an old used phone I bought off E-bay to hold me over. 1. This phone is very fragile; my old phones I could accidentally drop many times before they became un-usable; this one fell once (from no more than 3 feet) and that ""beautiful face"" was cracked from side to side; thank god I had insurance. 2. All Verizon Wireless phones have the same operating system/interface now that is terrible! You can barely customize anything; some of the worst things: a. You can only customize one or two of the 4 shortcut keys on the front page; the other two are ""locked"" by Verizon to use features that cost money! b. The two soft keys on the front page are not customizable anymore c. There are only 3 or 4 alarm clocks and none are renameable (for reminders) d. Using the calendar; if you need to reschedule an appointment for the next day you'll have to create a whole new event and delete the old one as you cannot just roll over the date of the current day to ""tomorrow."" e. For text entry the iTap (predictive text) is not the default and most importantly cannot be made the default. This means, that if you need to type out a text message or a calendar appointment you'll have to switch each time to the iTap entry mode. f. You cannot change the color of menus; you're stuck with the ugly red and black theme everywhere g. Basically, if you are used to and like the Motorola OS/Interface you're SOL. This Verizon OS really is just a small step above those phones with 3 or 4 buttons that your grandpa or child would use in emergencies; it is dumbed down and handcuffs you. On purpose I'm sure; read about the class action lawsuit regarding the Motorola v710 (a phone that I also owned and was very familiar with); this Verizon OS makes that v710 seem like a super computer. 3. I went through 4 phones before I went to an old one. Every single one would work for a few days and then the ringer would not ring or the earpiece volume would drop to near in-audible. I suspect this is thanks to the shabby Verizon Wireless OS/Interface About the only thing this phone is good for is for teenagers (and those who refuse to grow up) who waste their time and money using this phone as a crappy MP3 and video player or poor quality camera. Oh and I believe even the typical Motorola options for the camera are crippled by the Verizon OS. Oh, and did I mention that if you DID want to use this phone as a crappy MP3 player you'd have to plug in an earphone adapter that takes up the phone charging port? I wonder how many songs you can crank out of it before your phone needs charging; especially if you use Bluetooth like I do. This phone and every other Verizon Wireless Phone (with the exception of Smart Phones) are worthless! They are crippled by the Verizon Wireless OS and I do not recommend them to anyone. It is a shame because Verizon has very good coverage; at least in my area.",negative

"I got the C650 as a replacement for the T610 - I liked the menus/display on the t610 better but was having major reception issues (signal strength jumped all over the place, missed/dropped calls) in major cities all along the west coast. I had this problem with three different t610 phones (how many I had to try before they'd let me switch brands) and know other people who've had this problem too. The c650 gets much more reliable reception. And to respond to other's comments: I find it's relatively easy to pop off the back if you put two nails of one hand in the two slots and one nail on the other hand where the silver inlay is on the top of the phone. I personally like that it's not easily removed - so your battery doesn't just pop off randomly (my old sprint phone would do this). Also, if you set one of the soft keys to ""recent"" you can easily access missed or received calls. You only have to hit the call button to see previously dialed calls. You don't need phonebook as a soft key since pushing the up/down button will get it for you. Finally, use the menu-* key lock! I've had the phone go through menus in my pocket and order wallpapers/ringtones without me even knowing it! Respectable phone, not perfect, but reliable.",positive
I just lost my synch adapter and it is on back order everywhere. Unfortunately this is necessary to connect to computer and to charge the player. Earliest date I can find one is 10/23 due to some shipping problem with creative labs. I'm at a loss now that the battery is dead. This is the dumbest idea ever. Why didn't they design the player so that the cords attached directly to the player? I agree that you should order a back-up as this thing is so easy to lose and so important.,negative
"I took awhile to receive my order. Once I had the phones I found that they were not the same quality as the original Razor. That was disappointing, as I have had a few Razors over the years.

The second held the charge for a half day only. The charge on my cell phone with no apps lasts a week. I did get this battery from another vendor at Amazon and lo and behold, it is working just fine.

The sound quality on my end is very good, but some people I have called complain of an echo on their end and it picks up a lot of ambient noise. I have not tried pairing with multiple phones, using it in a windy environment, or using the feature to find it when it is lost. I did try the voice command dialing, and it works intermittently. I cannot say that I am very impressed with this headset, although it is convenient, I would definitely not buy another one.",neutral

"Nothing in the product description prepared me for the surprise of finding that this product is a ""Communication Set for Her.""

I guess the little design highlight curlicues on the silver body may have been a clue, but they are much more prominent on the actual unit than in the picture. The unit itself is also curious. It comes with a ridiculous charging case so that is an extra thing that you are going to have to take with you when you travel, and the charger itself is gigantuan. So to be clear, there is no way to charge this thing without the superfluous case. One more thing to carry, break, or lose. Too much junk to keep track of. It also comes with a bunch of adapters for foreign power supplies. How strange. And a nice silver cloth pouch with matching design curlicues. And a great big full booklet manual with super tiny print. The unit works passably well for one without noise reduction. On a test call my wife was able to understand me over the stereo playing at comfortable listening volume, however she could clearly hear the music in the background. I could hear her fine. About par for the course for an inexpensive unit. It paired easily with my smartphone and has intuitive controls.",neutral

The second one broke within the warranty period and it was replaced but that one broke too after several months of use. When I say ""broke"", I mean the noise canceling stopped working. The headset works but it's useless to me when there is no noise canceling. I bought a second gen Jawbone which is my fourth Jawbone and I am hoping it will last longer than my first gen ones. The only reason I keep buying Jawbone is because I have not found a better noise canceling headset.",neutral

I am very pleased with the bluetooth portion of the Plantronics Voyager 855 that I ordered. It works really well and seems to have good clarity and volume on both ends of the calls. I am very frustrated with the wireless stereo headset/bluetooth option. The connector piece for this option was cracked/defective upon receipt and when I tried to install it the piece broke. Now I cannot use the wireless headphones to listen to music while working out. I contacted the company that sent me the devise and they still have not responded; it has been several weeks and nothing.

However, the Cingular service has been horrible! I have 2-3 bars on my cell phone when I am home, but you cant not hear anything. It constantly droppes calls, the receiption is pretty bad almost anywhere compared to T-Mobile. My friend lives about 15 minutes away from me and he has the same problems with Cingular. Whenever I have to make an important call I have to use someone else's cell phone (as long as it is not on Cingular). The phone was activated about a week earlier before I actually received it from Amazon and Cingular charged for an extra week of service. That wasn't very nice of them. I am returning this phone and switching back to T-Mobile before the 30 day period is not over yet (23 day period in my case).

Bottom line, if you don't use your phone for business emails, calls, and constant use all day, it will last but it doesn't hold the charge as well as the Anker. I will try the Limefuel next. Ideally, I want a battery pack for about 8,000 to 10,000 mAh but with somewhat slim profile. I know it will still be thick but as longs as it's not as thick as a house brick.",neutral

"Recently had this installed in our truck. It works as advertised. I can hear people clearly and they can hear me with no problem. I had a habit of talking too loudly in the beginning, but have sinced changed my ways. I opted for the the HF850 as opposed to the 1000 because my phone had all of the missing features built in, so I didn't really need to spend the extra cash. I have a Motorola E815 phone which I'm also happy with. I had to remember what buttons did what at first but have sinced gotten everything down (using it for 5 weeks now). System comes on when I start the truck (gives a beep to let me know its on) and all of my calls are only a press of a button away. System will disconnect when the call ends automatically. Don't know how I ever lived without it. Only problem I had was placement--couldnt find a decent spot in my truck to mount it (uses doubled sided tape). It's ok in its current location, but its kinda a stretch to reach it. Not a problem on the HF850, just with the design of my truck",positive

"I've had this headset for about a year now; I use it with a Razr. It's a fine headset from a technical perspective: the sound is fine, it's easy to pair and use, etc. I haven't run into any problems using it in a car, or out of doors. However, it's really not very comfortable: the hook that goes over the ear is just a bit too stiff and edgy, I wouldn't want to wear it for a long call (more than 15-20min say). For comfort and performance, consider the Plantronics Voyager 510 (around $50 at Amazon); I've had one of those (now used by my son), and it is excellent.

"The Jawbone 2 has a great aesthetic design and received good reviews from one of the electronics review sites, so I thought I would give it a try. My experience using it for four months: - The volume control is awkward to use - you are never really sure if you are increasing or decreasing the volume. Plus, unless you are careful, it is easy to cut off a call without meaning to. - The sound quality is variable - sometimes good, sometimes frustratingly bad.

Camera has worked well, including the video recorder. Unfortunately, I just learned that it does not have a voice dialing feature. That one missing feature means I would not purchase it today due to the new law in Washington (California too) requiring headsets while driving.

"Yes, this item works well. But yes, it takes some RF and electronics knowledge to make it work right. For me, I have verizon cell phones operating in the 800MHZ cell band in my area. In my house we had zero to 1 bar and could make calls but they were frequently dropped or cut in and out. We could walk down the block and the signal was better. Our house sits in a depression and most of the cell signal was going over the top of our house. To really make this thing work well I would recommend the following tips: 1) Get cell phone for which you know how to enable DEBUG mode and get an actual NUMBER for the signal strength it is receiving. 2) Go ahead and purchase the optional YAGI directional antenna for this unit. 3) Buy an approximately 4 x 8 ft. piece of radiant barrier ( a type of insulation available at home depot made of aluminum). 4) Mount YAGI antenna in rafters of house or outside on roof. 5) Mount cell extender about 3 feet from the floor in the top living level of your house in a center location of the house. 6) Place radiant barrier in attick directly between the 2 antennas. This will help improve the signal separation a lot and will make this thing work. 7) Power up cell extender. If when you power it up you get ANY flashing amber lights, then your signal isolation between the two antennas isn't good enough and you must do something about it (move antennas, get YAGI with higher gain, etc.) If you get no amber lights on startup then the device is operating at max or almost max amplification and power output (only 1/2 watt but plenty for a single house). We now have 3-5 bars all over our house, deck, porch, and even garage! Calls are clear and there is no breaking up or dropping of calls. We have 2700 sq ft. house with 2 stories plus a basement. I am using a 10dbi antenna from some guys out of New York I found on the internet. I paid $99 for this antenna because they told me it was a 17dbi antenna, but they lied. However, it works and I am happy with what works... Running continously for 2 months now without a single glitch. Zero maintenance when installed correctly. There are 2 different models for the 800MHZ and 1900MHZ cell bands. BE SURE TO BUY THE CORRECT ONE FOR THE PHONE CARRIER YOU HAVE.",positive
"I recently made the upgrade from the i730 to this phone. I got tired of the i730 because almost every Nextel customer has this phone and it was hurting my eyes looking at it. For me, the i860 was not hard to get used to because it has almost every single freature as the i730, with the exception of the camera. I like the new feature where you no longer have to go on the internet to send and receive text messages. What I like most about the phone is its internal screen. The internal screen is the only reason why I did not return the device. I am was not that intrigued with the open flip button, because I get the feeling it is going to wear out with age of the phone. The battery life is about the same as any other Nextel phone (It all depends on your cellphone usage).

"This bluetooth is just okay for me but not worth the money paid. It's a little staticky when you are only just a few feet away from the phone and you hear a popping sound as if you are about to be electrocuted. The fit is definately off. You cannot fit the earpiece around your ear and the other one in your ear at the same time unless you bend the one that goes around your ear. If you bend the one that goes around your ear, you risk the chance of bending it to the point where it hurts when it's on your ear and then you can't wear it for a long period of time.

It is tricky to turn it on and connect to phone. Pressing power button a sec more and you enter pairing mode. Equally tricky to disconnect it. The volume buttons are hard. The ear gel pads (comes in three sizes) are flacky and with no instructions to install metallic earhook. The only good thing about it is the mini USB charger which is cute, looks like a pen and fits in your pocket, clip included. If that's what you are after, go for it. Except, it won't work for any other device. Just to double check that problem is with the headset and not phone, I used 3 yrs old Motorola HS850 headset. Perfect!

The reception is slightly better than my previous nokia, but still missed a lot of calls especially in buildings. The camera is a lamb, and the menu is not as clear as Nokia's. One thing I hate is the mode set button at the side. Whenever you happen to touch it, the phone will let you change the ring tone mode with another side button. Since I carry the phone in my jeans, the ring mode is always accidentally changed to vibrate or even silent. But my impression to this phone began to turn to the bright side after I mindlessly carried this phone in my swimsuit and jumped into the Michigan lake. Of course, the phone refused to work right out of the water. But after I dried the phone with a electronic fan for two afternoons, the phone come back alive like a miracle! If you are a careless person like me, you may found this feature very useful since you could put the phone into the washer or something. Basically, that's why I give it a four star. Without the story above, I would have given it a one star.",positive
I'm actually trying to resell this item because it just isn't worth the hassle of setting up and getting it all to be right. I end up having to reset it more often then it helps my signal. Also I didn't even notice a different in my AT&T iPhone 3GS signal... I suppose this would a be great product if you had a phone it worked perfectly with.,neutral
"I had the Mobal card for a couple of years and was happy with their data rates but the incoming calls are what killed me. Like others here, my bill was nearly $200 for one trip with not-heavy usage, all talking to people in the same country (i.e., not calling back to the US or anything). We've been much happier with Roam Simple, which we've had for the past 2 years. Free incoming calls are a huge help. You can call your party in the local country for 45 cents, then just have them call you back if you're going to talk a while. With RS incoming texts are free and I've been very happy with the data rates. I really like having a SIM of my own attached to my credit card with always the same phone number because we go abroad nearly every year. When the plane lands I pop in the European SIM, let them know we've landed, and am on my way, with email, calendar, contacts all intact.",negative
"I thought Virgin Mobile would be great. I was wrong. It took forever on the phone to setup with customer service. They have this minute pack drama you have to add every month and convert. The phone charger runs hot even though the phone is nice, so don't keep the charger plugged in. When you cancel you need a pin. That is my fault, at least they texted it to me. Avoid Virgin Mobile if you don't want a high maintenance pre paid cellphone plan.",negative
"With the hands-free law coming soon in California, I started doing research on headsets, but found that there are also speakerphones. Marvelous idea. I was not particularly excited about sticking a headset to my head. I am just not that cool. I looked all over at the different speakerphones. Some have very good reviews, but their design, in my opinion, leaves much room for improvement, both functionally and aesthetically. Then I saw the Jabra SP5050. Perfecto! Not only does it do everything the other speakerphones that I was looking at do, but it does it in a form factor that is both pleasing to the eye and very functional. Because it is so thin, I don't even notice it on my sun visor. The interior of my car is black, so it also blends in very well. Call it a stealth speakerphone. Operating it could not be more simple. The area where the speaker is also doubles as a ""mouse"" if you will. Click and hold for a few seconds to turn it on/off. Click once to answer a call. Click once to hang up. Double click to redial the last number, etc. It pairs with my phone (Blackjack II) flawlessly. The sound level, which some have complained about, is very nice. Please note that the speaker level on your phone also affects the sound level on the speakerphone, so if your phone volume is turned down, you won't get much volume out of the speakerphone. Once I realized this I had all the sound level I needed, even at highway speeds, and my car is not the quietest in the cabin. I can hear callers very well. People on the other end have given me mixed comments. At highway speeds they say you can hear the background noise, but that it is not loud nor distracting from the call. On quieter roads and a slower speeds, when my car is more quiet, I have been told they could not tell I was on a speakerphone and thought I was just talking on my phone normally. Overall a very good review, in my opinion. The full-duplexing has worked flawlessly. Both people can talk at the same time. No one is cut out while the other talks. Some speakerphones claim to have full-duplex, but I have read complaints that it does not always work. On this speakerphone it has always worked. There are only two things I would change about this speakerphone: 1) I would include a wall charger. Currently you can only charge the device in the car. I am rarely in my car long enough to get a full charge, so being able to charge it in my apartment would be nice. 2) I would change the visor clip so that you can easily remove it from the speakerphone for easy transport, like with some type of quick-release mechanism. This thing is so thin and sleek that I think it would be great to carry around with you to business meetings. It will easily fit in the pocket of your business suit. You could pull it out, connect it, and have a productive meeting with a room full of people. It could also easily be used at home so you could have a hands-free conversation, like when you are cooking dinner, for example. Overall a very nice product and I would highly recommend it to anyone. After seeing it, my girlfriend is thinking about getting one for herself. PS: One thought I have is to attach some velcro to the back of the unit and attach it somewhere in my car other than the visor. You could also do this in your home so you could simply attach the speakerphone to a designated spot in your kitchen, or whatever room you plan to use it. That would make it very quick and ease to move from location to location without having to worry about the visor clip.",positive

Also when I am using the zero to 100 scale I sometimes get a reading of 6, but on the 0 to 3 scale a reading of 3 in the same spot.

"I think I spent a good 10-12 hours researching which ""voice isolation"" bluetooth I'd buy. I've tried many different brands and my last one, Plantronics Voyager 510, just wasn't cutting it though it was comfortable. The final decision came down to Blueant Z9 or Aliph Jawbone. After countless reading of user reviews, it seemed that many people complained that the Jawbone was uncomfortable (though a modification was available) and some complained of poor voice isolation. The BlueAnt Z9 seemed to have mostly excellent reviews except for ""customer service"" reviews (poor). Anyhow, after barely two days of owning it I've come to realize that it just doesn't perform as expected. The good: 1) It's comfortable if you have a small to medium thin ear. 2) You can hear the other person fairly clearly 3) The engineering and craftmanship is outstanding 4) The packaging is impressive though a bit tedious to open! The bad: 1) Voice isolation doesn't work even with the latest upgrade (v4.3). I've tried it INSIDE my car with the windows UP and no radio, and the receiver actually told me that it was picking up A LOT of background noise. In fact, the receiver wanted to hang up because it was THAT BAD. Even at voice isolation MAX, it would pick up a lot of interior noise when it was DEAD quiet in my car, could this have been a defective unit? MAYBE. 2) Upgrading the firmware is tricky. First you have to load a driver (and fiddle in Device Manager), restart your PC, then hold the VOL+ button, and then while holding connect your bluetooth. Not exactly ""plug and play"" that an average person would have the patience for. 3) The charging connector looks sensitive. It's a USB style (similar to a Blackberry style) home-charger that may become ""loose"" after many charges. Just a minor nuisance, but probably not a flaw in engineering. Bottom line: I would recommend this bluetooth if you have the patience to try it out. Perhaps mine was indeed defective, but the voice isolation certaintly wasn't as ""great"" as other users and professional reviews suggested.",negative

"This product has been discontinued by the manufacturer and after using it its obvious to see why. As with any vocal reducing product, it all depends on the song you choose as to whether it will work or not. Also, I did not find it as simple to use as the ad sounds, and basically had to start from scratch at the beginning of each song. I have a newer, 160G model ipod, and it would not work with it, which I found surprising since I have never had any compatibility issues before. Everything that has worked with my older, 60G model has worked, except this. Luckily I still have the old one. The reverb function is an absurdly high echo when set to high so I suggest keeping it to low, and for whatever reason the best sound came through the FM radio function. What I really needed however was a microphone with a recorder function, and this does not allow for that. The price (about $10 plus shipping) was really good so I still didn't get a bad deal for a ""toy"", but I would never consider it to be a serious or professional piece of equipment.",neutral

My torch is easy to use and it holds the charge for a long time so when I'm ready to recharge my phone, I have the confidence that I am covered. Because the Torch is so versatile (thank god for the USB), I can also recharge my speakers as well but so far that has not been the case.

"I use a lot of AA batteries for photography and camping. I got tired of slow cheap chargers and bought the Maha Powerex MH-C801D 2 years ago. I couldn't be happier. As many other write about it, it's doing its job, and fast. I personally always use soft charging to go easy on my batteries and it never takes more than a couple of hours to charge AA or AAA cells. I use sanyo enloops, duracel, energizer and all work fine. How great this unit is became more evident when I bought and started using the Ansmann 5207123 Energy 16 Charger a few weeks ago. I needed a D cell charger and read some scary reviews about the MAHA D-cell charger, so went with the ansmann. First of all, the Ansmann is HUGE. it does have a capacity of 12 AA/AAA or 6 D, and no exterior power supply, but it's big. not a unit for travel really. But my biggest issue is how slow it is. D-cells took over 24 hours to charge (probably closer to 30 hours). Tiny AAA cells that would take an hour in the Maha are charging for 8 hours now in the Ansmann and only 2 of the 4 are ready. My observation - if you are only looking for a AA/AAA charger, and have modern NiMH batteries that can handle serious charging current - go with the Maha.",neutral
I have had this headset for about 3 months now. The noise reduction is remarkable. I can be in a airport and no one even knows I am out of my office. Wind is a problem with this headset as with any other headset. The noise reduction does not reduce wind noise. If it's a windy day you are out of luck but I don't know of any headset that works that way. Sound - The sound is a little tinny but you get used to it pretty quickly. Comfort - I have owned at least a dozen Bluetooth headsets and this is by far the most comfortable. There are different clips and ear pieces that come with the headset. I have worn it for over 8 hours straight and don't even know it's there. Charging - Propriety USB charger that plugs into the back of the phone. They also supply a plug for an outlet so you can charge it without your computer. I bought 2 chargers one for home and one for my laptop bag. Battery - Very good battery life. I cannot remember exact times but I use it often every day and have not run out of charge yet. Storage - This is the one thing that is a pain. It does not come in a case and putting it in your pocket is a real pain. I know this is trivial but I wish there was a case for it when I am not wearing it. Overall I really like this headset and can honestly say this is the best one I have owned.,positive

I like that it hangs snugly around your ear, and nothing protrudes into your ear; it lays flush against your ear. I never have a problem hearing, and no one has a problem hearing me. It is very easy to operate, and the range is better than the phone range itself.

"OK, this thing is the highest rated bluetooth handsfree and cell phone accessory on Amazon for good reasons. I've owned mine now for about six months and have loved every minute of it. I was going to buy a Jabra bt250 for my Motorola v360 (I bought one of those for my wife) but read these reviews and I'm glad I did. I talked to a friend of mine after I placed the order and he said that his wife has one and that she loved it. Alright, I really like the whole pros and cons review format that people use so I'll use it here too. Pros: -It is very comfortable. My first bluetooth was a Jabra bt130 and was very uncomfortable; this was a welcome relief! -Different fitting options. It comes with a few different ear pieces so you can choose the best fit. I was able to find one that fits quite well. I was wishing that it would have come with some of the gel ear pieces like my wifes has but it does the job well enough without them. -The sound quality (on both ends) is very good. One problem I had with my Jabra was I could never quite ear what people were saying. No problems with this one! Actually, I have to turn down the volume sometimes because I can hear my screaming daughter a little too well! :) I never have any problems about people hearing me either. -Fits quite securely against your head. This headset proves that comfort and fit are NOT mutually exclusive. So why did I rate this a four? Read on... Cons: -The power button is a bit small. The work around that I do with this is I turn the thing on and off while I am not wearing (a common work around for this thing, so I've read). -It drops the connection every once in a while. This gets a bit annoying at times but fortunately doesn't happen very often. -Doesn't support bluetooth version 2.0 or a2dp (stereo bluetooth). This really isn't an issue for me, though, as my phone doesn't support either of those standards anyway. -Talk time is a bit low compared to some other headsets but it still isn't bad. -It acts like it's not connected sometimes even though it is. Let me explain; I pick up the handsfree and dial a number. My phone says that I've connected to the person BUT I can't hear them and they can't hear me! Also annoying; thankfully, again, this doesn't happen very often and seems only to happen when it's been connected for a while. All of that being said; I love it! I don't regret buying it and my wife wants one now! It will definitely be worth the money you pay for it.",positive

"After reading so many different reviews about so many different headsets, I decided to go with the Plantronics Voyager 510. My only hesitations were it's age and it's design. But, in the end I told myself that this one has gotten thousands of reviews and its average is still waaayyy up there. Let me tell you, this particular model works as advertised. Pros: Distance - It gets staticky around 25+ feet. Awesome! Clarity - I can hear the calls clearly because of the in ear style. Plus, people on the other end can hear me even when it's windy. Comfort - My girlfriend is constantly taking it off my ear because I forget that it's there. Versatility - I use both ears. My right side is preferred, but I use my left when I'm driving other people. Neutral: Battery - I really haven't gauged the timing of the battery life, but I'm not complaining about it. Cons: Design - It looks too funky, but for all of the function-over-form people, the 510 works great! Mic Boom - Because I have a wide face, the boom sometimes swivels in and touches my cheek (I hate anything touching my face unknowingly) Since purchasing this headset, I've tried 2 others, the Samsung Wep200 and the upgraded Plantronics Voyager 520. The Samsung was purchased for the girlfriend because its tiny structure was appealing. She complained that it wouldn't stay on her ear. I tried it and agreed. Also, it's clarity and distance was subpar relative to the 510. I ended up giving it to my brother. The Plantronics Voyager 520 was also purchased for the girlfriend because the Samsung didn't work out too well. She's making me go broke! I was honestly excited about the 520. After all, it was the latest and greatest. Latest it is, but greatest it isn't. It doesn't have different size ear buds like the 510, but luckily it fit her ear. (phew!) Distance is horrible. I can't go more than 10 feet without getting static. The size of this thing is a little on the HUGE side, but I still think it looks better than the 510. It's noise cancellation works like the 510, which is one good thing. Bottom line, if it wasn't for its poor performance with distance, my girlfriend would have loved it AND I wouldn't have to return it and find her a new one. The things I do for that woman! If you're reading this, I still love you hunni! :) Conclusion: If it wasn't for the 2 Cons factors, this headset would be perfect for me! But relative to its replacement the 520 and the Samsung, this model is hands down THE headset to get.",positive

"Unfortunately I bought this product in a store before reading the on-line reviews. I experienced the same audio-problems reported by many other people: a loud buzzing background noise in the outgoing audio when using Skype. This rendered the product useless for me since I purchased it for making Skype calls (there is a big ""Skype certified"" logo on the box). I also think it's quite complicated to use. Although I got it to work by following the instructions step-by-step I think it's too easy to make a mistake in the sequence of ""click here, then press the button on the headset for a specific amount of time, then press it again after the unit beeps, then click that button in the Bluetooth window, ..."" etc. that one is supposed to go through before the device is ready to use. Perhaps after a while one gets used to it. The main flaw of this bluetooth combo is the sound quality.",negative

"The Motorola H350 bluetooth headset is one of the cheaper models out there, and it shows. PAIRING The H350 pairs like most bluetooth headsets. Tell your phone to search for headsets, then hold down the H350 main button for about 10 seconds. Your phone finds the H350 and you hit ""ok."" This works as expected and is no different from any other bluetooth headset. I've used this headset with my Motorola RAZR and Uniden landline bluetooth-capable phone. COMFORT/DESIGN The H350 has an earclip that easily pops off so that you can fit the headset onto either ear. The clip itself is flexible rubber and while it seems moderately comfortable at first, I find my ear starts to hurt after about 30 minutes. Ideally, I do not want to notice or feel that I'm wearing a headset. I definitely cannot say that about the H350. The speaker lightly rests over your ear canal. There are two volume buttons on the top and bottom of the headset to increase, decrease, or mute the speaker. SOUND QUALITY I've tried quite a few headsets out there from Plantronics, Motorola and Jabra to compare. Most of them have some deficiencies, and the H350 is no different. People on the other end of my conversations state that while my voice is clear, it sounds a little ""far-away."" I also think that the highest volume ability of the H350 speaker on my end is still too weak (yes, I have perfectly normal hearing). When you max out the speaker volume the sound becomes a bit distorted and it's still not loud enough to clearly hear the other caller while driving in a car, even with the windows all the way up. This is in stark contrast to the Plantronics 640-665 series which have jelly earpieces that comfortably squish into your ear canal for optimal volume and clarity. As a result, I can only recommend the H350 for home use where there isn't alot of background noise present. OVERALL At it's basic level, the Motorola H350 bluetooth headset works. You maintain a good connection between it and your phone within 10-12 feet (like any other functional headset). However, it's shortcomings in volume and mic quality cannot be overlooked. I only recommend this headset if you plan on using it at home or in the office, and only if you got it for a great price. If you need higher quality, you may want to open your wallet a little more and look into that Plantronics 640-665 line.",neutral
"I have been looking for a quality, high-audio quality set of headphones for use with a wide variety of bluetooth sources, including my T-Mobile Dash, Windows XP, and MAC OS X based systems. Unfortunately, my S805 units didn't rise up the challenge. At first, I considered the source material and/or the source BT transmitter was to blame. However, exhaustive further testing showed that the upper-frequency response of these units just left a lot to be desired. The distortion sounded like digital noise, or the result of clipping of the dynamic range. However, even at low source volumes and amplitudes and headphone volumes and amplitudes the high frequencies just sound awful.",negative

"With a dozen digital cameras and loads of kids toys to power, we have hundreds of rechargeable batteries. These perform as good as Japanese 2650mah Duracells. Even in cameras that don't like rechargeable batteries, these read full power and last 2X longer than a quality alkaline. The batteries I received were Japanese AA 2000mah dated 2009 and AAA 800mah dated 2008. They arrived charged and ready to go! They appear to be the exact same battery as the Duracell. The charger requires you charge them in pairs. This is a generic Chinese charger sold under several brand names. The contacts are a bit flimsy, but I never had one break. Charge time is roughly 7 hours, and they read about 1.4VDC when fully charged and 1.1VDC when exhausted. They have no problem with my 1 hour fast chargers from Duracell, Energizer and Kodak. The C & D cell adapters work fine. Of course, a AA just can't deliver the power of the larger battery and they die about 3X faster than the appropriate alkaline. Still, they come in very handy! You get 8 AA and 2 AAA batteries... no C & D batteries at this low price! The batteries and adapters are a smidge bigger than alkaline batteries, so you may have trouble inserting them in some products (Mini Maglite for instance).",positive

"I ordered this phone a month back and just received it a few days ago. I bought it mainly for the 3G connection and the fact that it's an Nseries phone. I came from a Nokia 6230 which is a fairly small candy bar style phone so going to a bigger flip phone like the N75 is a big step. I did use a 6102i or whichever free phone cingy had at the time and my gripes are basically compared to those two phones. HATE: - Sim card access. I don't know if there's another way to do this but once you insert that SIM card, you have to have a child take it out. Almost impossible for me to grab and pull out. - Speakerphone is really low and almost inaudible even with the volume cranked up - Vibrate on the phone is really... mild. If it's in your pocket, you probably won't feel it. Especially if you're on the train, for example. - Long boot up compared to the two non Symbian phones I had. - very annoying pop port .. i didn't think it would be an issue but if you have to hold the phone with two hands to insert your headset... annoying. - no emoticons on txt messages??!! - to reply to a txt you have to hit options->reply->via txt msg. Why can't i just hit reply and go straight to the txt box? - zoom on phone takes f o r e v e r. - where is the STOPWATCH and COUNTDOWN TIMER?! - fingerprints/face prints get xfrd to phone easily - my battery life : internet use only on/off = 4-6 hours with 2 10min calls and 6hours standby; MobiRadio on speaker, continuous = 1.5hours; mixed internet, mobiradio, regular radio, phone calls, text messaging, tinkering with phone= 6 hours or so. All hours est from full charge to when the batt just dies. Includes intermittent standbys and where I just look through the phone. The charger is now tethered to my hip. Like: - really soft and big keys - ability to move around the files/ folders - Nice big screen - Video (choppy and pixelated but it will do) will con't as the months pass..... ** UPDATE: -battery life has improved significantly. I still use it 13hrs a day but I now charge just once a day. And i use it more. -I also bought this primarily as an MP3 player and I'm having the same problem that I had with the 6230. The shuffle is not really a shuffle. I have about 200 songs in there and it insists on playing the same songs over and over every 10th-15th song... it seems to loop to songs I've heard already every single time. -I use the HS-31 headset that I had before and the volume is just really low. I have to roll the windows up in my car in order to carry a conversation. I thought it was just the speakerphone that had a low volume. The bluetooth earpiece was loud, though. -And finally, 3G. I found no discernable difference between EDGE and the 3G networks while downloading video or viewing webpages. Maybe it loaded up a page a few seconds faster but that was about it. Mobiradio still buffered every now and then in 3G networks so that was surprising as well. I'm still going to keep the phone, though.",neutral

"I purchased this unit to use with my motorola V3 Razr cell phone so that I could talk hands-free with people while I did things around the house. It replaced my previous headset, a motorola HS810, which I let get exposed to water (whoops). Despite the higher price tag on the HS810, I feel this is a better headset. It's very sturdy-I've dropped it on my hardwood floor and it still works just fine. There is no unfolding boom mike with a hinge that wears out. The controls are simple-hold down the call button to turn it on or off, tap it to answer or hang up. Mating the device to my phone was simple and took seconds, and I haven't had it drop a call yet. The microphone seems to work very well-I've never had anyone complain that they couldn't hear me, and I've used the unit outside in windy conditions. Of course, there are some negatives. I wish the volume was louder-I have it turned up all the way and it still sounds a little faint. The earpeice is tight and secure but it also pinches, so long calls are going to be uncomfortable. It's also not as eye-catching as some other bluetooth headsets. If you want a workhorse headset that's dependble, reliable, and sturdy, this is the unit for you.

"I recently recieved my Wilson signal booster amp and antenna. No problems installing, but was suprised at the outside antenna(Wondering if it will hold up). Installation took about 2 hrs. (As I mounted it on my roof 15-20 feet up). I anxiously made all of the connections. Before I activated the amp, I took a reading of my signal strength from my 2 Samsung phones and my Verizon USB 760 modem. I had 2 bars. Then came the moment of truth. I fired up the amp and really didn't notice all that much difference, untill I was 6-8 feet from the desktop antenna. I did gain 2 bars when within 6-8 foot of the antenna, BUT when you move farther away than 10 feet, back to same old 2 bar signal strength. Next was the modem test. Computer is 20 foot from desktop antenna..NO DIFFERENCE.....So I pulled my cords/cables (glad I left 15 feet extra)so I could put the antenna within 5 feet of my modem..Went to full blown 4 bars and 4 bars on EV as well..It did speed up the data transfer/web surfing. I guess the main point here is... If you're within 10 feet of the desktop antenna..You will notice a difference. anymore than that FORGET IT !! THIS IS NOT A WHOLE HOME SOLUTION !! Within 10 feet=Golden... Farther=Good Luck Chuck The jury is still out to me if its worth 230 Bucks..Ill keep evaluating... Hope this helps..

"I originally ordered this for work, I work in a factory and did not want to bump into something and smash my phone's screen (samsung moment). It fits the Samsung Moment, but have to watch the talk and end buttons, make sure to slide the phone up to the top of the case or the foam inside will press down on them making your phone stay lit and draining your battery. The case is like a tank, and as big as one...lol, for real it protects great but is bulky. It cannot fit in your pocket good, I kept mine in my jacket pocket, people would laugh and say it looked like I was carrying around a display case, but hey my phone didn't get broke! I tried to use the clip on my jeans but it's so big and it bounces around when you walk!!! So if your looking to protect your phone this is the way to go, but if you just want a hard case to carry your phone this might not be what your looking for!",positive
"I have been a blackberry user since 2003 and this newest addition is a great upgrade to the lineup. Good size and feel. The screen is the most beautiful I have ever seen. Absolutely superb screen resolution and brightness. The Edge downloads are really fast and the email functionality is the gold standard which is what really seperates Blackberries from everyone else. They could not have made the email set-up any easier. Just enter your email address and password. That's it, the blackberry does the rest. I love how they also have set-up an individual folder for each email account besides the general message folder. People are amazed when I tell them how little I paid for it through Amazon. I ordered it with standard shipping on a Tuesday evening and had it in my hands fully operational on Friday. It took less than an hour for the battery to fully charge out of the box. This is my first time with T-Mobile but my experience has been stellar. They answer my emails promptly and when I asked a question that was beyond their capability they promptly transferred me to RIM's Blackberry support which has always been great. The tips they have given me over the phone for shortcuts and navigation tricks were awesome. This phone should satisfy any road warrior. I have read posts by others complaining about various functionality issues but these are people who either a) don't own one, b) never read the manual, or c) never called tech support to get an answer. For the record, you can delete messages en massse, type phone numbers memonically i.e. 1-800-you-idiot, view your calendar and address book while on the phone, etc.. As a phone, the reception is good and T-Mobile has great coverage. I couldn't imagine being on a call and not being able to look in my calendar or email inbox. The conference call feature works like a charm and is a great feature when you are on the go. Being able to dial a number someone sent me in a text message or email directly without having to exit message/email is fantastic. The addition of the exterior mute and extra function buttons are a welcome upgrade. What more can I can write about this great phone? It is hands down, the best smartphone on the market.",positive

"I have tried more than 12 different bluetooth headsets. The SBH-500 is the best ever. Outstanding call quality - never a complaint from the other party. Outstanding bass response, high frequency and stereo separation. It sometimes loses the bluetooth connection with my Iphone but I think the problem is the Iphone because it does that with most of the other headsets I tested. I will buy a second SBH-500 as a backup.",positive
"Well I just got mine today which is October 26th 2017, I haven't really seen any difference since I've been using it today I'm not sure if this thing is program for LTE or just 4G and 3G but from what I see on the box it says 4 Gs I haven't seen anywhere where it says LTE and I believe LTE and 4G or two different types of network.. But I do see a difference in my 3-g because I go to my settings and set my phone on 3-g mode and I do see the difference in 3-g when I put the phone in the Cradle but I have not seen anything for 4G LTE and I think my phone only runs on 3G or 4G LTE I don't think there's a 4G programmed in my phone I have the LG G5 I gave three stars because it did boost it on 3G but I'm an over-the-road driver so I'm going to test it out tomorrow morning when I hit to DC, and I have to drive over a lot of country roads in mountains because I'm coming out of Pennsylvania. If it doesn't impress me I'm sending it back... But I want the seller to let me know is this thing 4G LTE or just 4G?",neutral

"This is a great product. I recently purchased the LG Env 9000 phone and wanted a headset prior to the legal requirement for hands free phone while driving in July. My phone refuse to dial out when I spoke the words ""Call X"" as it was supposed to do according to the manual. When I tried it with the headset on it not only called out the contacts I had set up to call out, but it calls everybody in my contact list. The volume is fine and the earpiece is comfortable... the only reason I didn't give this unit 5 stars is the earpiece IS a little loose in my ears, fitting better in the right ear than the left. Would buy it again and have recommended it to several people. Still getting used to the whole wonderful concept of hands free phones..",positive

We have had the Virgin service for many years. They are the lowest cost of all the prepays as far as I can tell. In our area it the service is actually supplied by Sprint and coverage leaves a lot to be desired. Last year I bought the Flare for my wife. I have a similar model with Verizen but mine has no Bluetooth. I was exited to see the Flare had Bluetooth when we bought our new Kia Sorento with that feature built in. The only problem is the Flare will interface and call out but you can't answer a call with the Bluetooth. Kia has demonstrated this problem is with the phone and not the car. I also found another complaint of the same nature with a different vehicle. I contacted LG about the problem and they said sorry we were having trouble but they had no plans for an update or fix. In all the Virgin service is a decent value and the LG Flare has been reliable.,neutral

"Don't know what other reviewers are seeing. I opened the package, cleaned the iphone surface with a moist paper towel first, then with a dry napkin (my simple way of cleaning the surface), then cleaned with the cleaning cloth supplied (it all took less than a minute), and applied the screen protector. It went on cleanly with very little bubbles that I could remove with the supplied applicator (a small plastic tool to remove the bubbles). BargainCell promptly shipped them on ordering and I got it in 3 days. More than a week now and so far the screen is holding up well. Update: Two months later and it is still ok - no bubbles and it is sticking to the surface correctly. Great product for a very good price (even the high cost of shipping is worth it), compared to similar products being sold in Fry's for $10 or more.",positive

"I spent about 4 hours doing online research on which BT headset to get my wife for her cell phone (Motorola SLVR L7c) She wanted something cool looking and had already expressed interest in the H500, but I wanted to double check and make sure there wasn't anything better for around the same price. So after a few hours of reading reviews on a dozen or so different headsets, I finally decided just to settle for the H500, I was really interested in some of the Plantronics sets, but she didn't care for the design.. I was a little worried about the H500 because the reviews are kinda so-so.. They're either good reviews or bad reviews. I got it for her so she wouldn't have to fumble around in the car with a phone so how it performs in a vehicle was going to be the make or break point with it. I'm pleased to say that the headset performs way better than I expected it to. Getting started is a breeze. All you have to do is charge the headset for about 2 hours (the LED light will go off once the battery is charged) once it's done charging you have to pair it up with your phone. All you do is press and hold the call button until the LED light stops blinking and stays lit, then you have your phone set to hands free mode and follow the simple steps on the phone (For us it was as simple as the phone finding the H500 and entering the 4-digit pin of 0000) The phone saved the settings and we were all set. Using the headset is no brainer basically. There 3 buttons; Main call/multi button & Volume up & down buttons. Pressing these buttons in various combos will yield different results like mute, hold, transfer, 3-way, etc. The retail package comes with a handy fold out that has all the functions and how to access them. The build quality of the headset is great as well.. The headset is about 2 inches from earclip to mic. Its very small and very comfortable to wear. The ear clip is removable to you can use it on either ear as well. The buttons feel solid as well. Now to the actual sound quality. The headset has performed great in all the scenarios we've tried so far.. Which has been in the house while watching TV, In the car with the stereo & windows up & down & in an office environment. I was most impressed with how it performed while driving, There is no static or any background noise at all and even with the radio and window down, the user can clearly be heard both ways. Again very impressive. The only environment we haven't really tried yet was at the store. I will update once I've tested that as well. I can't really comment on the battery life yet, because we've only had the unit for a day or so, but so far the unit has yet needed to be charged. So to summarize, great headset overall, feels & looks great, sound quality is super, voices are loud and clear. Performance in the car, home & office was excellent and the price Amazon offers is great compared to retail. I'm very very satisfied (and relieved!) that this unit performs as well as it does.",positive
"I understand that if you have zero bars, a product like this is unlikely to make much of a difference. That being said, it really did very little, at least in my experience. I drive thru an area where my service is weak, but I still have some service most of the time, and I was looking for something to help my data transmission (only one or two bars makes data unbelievably slow). This made it so I had 5 bars (max of 5) whenever I already had 3 or 4. However, it didn't seem to do anything whenever I had just 1 or 2 bars, which is disappointing because that's when you need it. I used it for a bit and tried it in various places, and it didn't seem to do much for me. I can't definitively say for sure it wouldn't help it other's situation. The places I tried to use it (in the mountains and in canyon roads) could have been the issue.",negative

"Having owned the Snapper a few years, I was looking forward to upgrade to the Cyclops. This Kyocera phone seemed like an improvement over the older UT Starcom model because of it's slimmer casing, internal antenna, and a 1.3 MP camera. However, I ended up keeping my old phone because I can't get over the many flaws of the Cyclops. I'll briefly summarize: PROS: -small form factor -internal antenna -1.3 MP camera -colorful design -external display CONS: -audio interference (white noise) possibly caused by antenna -when opened, phone bends too far back and is uncomfortable to hold -large external red LED flashes continuously during calls -text messaging is a pain because of small buttons and software glitches -average quality internal LCD display with childish graphics -camera quality about the same as higher end 0.3 VGA MP cameras",neutral

"I like the idea of this phone but I'm questioning the execution. It works well...when it works. I recently bought a house and instead of installing a land line, I decided to give this a shot. The audio is decent, but the caller on the other end sounds ""distant"", even with local calls. The person on the other line was impressed on how well the call sounded from their end. Getting the cell phone to connect initially was easy. Not long after using the phone I started to notice that the connection would drop and reconnect a number of times throughout the day. The auto connect sometimes connect but most of the time it takes a long time before connecting. It would occasionally disconnect during a call. I've tried a number of different configurations (phone near base station, far away from the base, phone plugged in, phone not plugged in, all other bluetooth devices turned off, etc) to no avail. The cellphone I am using is VX5300. I will be contacting GE to discuss a resolution or get a list of compatible devices. As of writing this review, I would not recommend this device.",neutral

"I got my phone with Verizon's ""New every 2"" plan. I have over a year before I can ditch this phone and get something that is that is more useful. In the beginning I had to adjust to the touch pad and it took a few days. Now, it dials radomly. If I check my call log, it may dial the last call on the list. If I unlock the screen to check the time, it may radomly dial the last call (sent or received). Hearing voices, you're not crazy, those are the annoyed voices of the people you inadvertently called when you put the phone in your pocket/purse. Not to mention the frequent Web connections that I have yet to figure out but I guess I touched something somewhere. In order to disconnect you have to unlock the phone which conveniently locks after the call is dialed. I don't know how many minutes I have burned on the web while the phone was buried in my purse. If the phone gets too close to your face during a call you will be muted or on some random menu that you don't want. Then after about 8 months the touch screen will stop responding when you touch it, you have to touch it several times or start over. Or, better still, it will speed scroll and you will be unable to stop it with out opening and closing the phone. I enjoyed reading the reviews because I see that the majority of them are about the same problems I have had. Verizon charges too much for every downloadable feature and also the chargers and headphones needed to get full use of all the extra features. If you are a techy and can get around all of these problems, great. For the average cell phone user this is not the phone for you.",negative

"My last Bluetooth headset, a Cardo Scala 500 featured great sound, wonderful battery life but a poor, floppy fit and very crummy construction. The poor thing literally fell apart after three months. I replaced the Cardo today with a Plantronics Explorer 320 and I'm pretty satisfied. First, recognize that there is no such thing as a perfect all-around headset for all phones and all users. It's pretty important that you buy from a source, like Amazon, where you can try things and return them if not satisfied. EBay may have great prices on stuff, but unless you know you'll like something, I wouldn't suggest buying a BT Headset there... way too hard to return. The Plantronics 320 is a budget version of their upper end headsets, but it is hard to see where they scrimped. The fit and finish of the product is excellent. The power connector is solid and snapped in and charged the unit quickly. It paired up to my Treo 650 on the first try and was identified correctly by name. Using the 320, I made several calls to automated numbers. All connected quickly, except the one where my phone automatically follows a script to punch in passwords. In that call, there was a considerable delay before the 320 took the audio signal from my phone. My old Cardo had the same delay, so I think this is a function of the phone. The fit of the headset is great for me. The unit has a small portion that inserts gently in my ear, and the wrap-around portion holds the device closely to my ear without any pressure or discomfort. I've been wearing it all day and it is light and very comfortable. Your mileage may vary. So what's not perfect? The sound quality isn't quite there. I pick up some static between the device and my Treo and it gets worse when the phone is on the other side of my body or when I move more than five feet away. It's not horrible, but it's there in my setup. Again, your mileage may vary.",positive
This has boosted our signal from 1 bar to 4and 5 bars. I would defiantly recommend this product.,positive
"The item shipped and arrived very fast. Sound quality is good, very comfortable and easy to operate.

The OEM version was advertised on Newegg at a lower price and included a charger and carry bag. This retail version had no carry bag, which is not a big deal but did not included a charger. A USB cord was provided without the adapter required to plug it in. The chord was also very short, lacking in convenience.",neutral
"The last PCS cell phone I owned was the venerable SCP-8100 from Sanyo. It was a cute little phone that was the second cell phone from any U.S. carrier that could take pictures. (The first-ever model was the SCP-5300 also from Sanyo, released in July 2002.) The PM-8200 addressed two shortcoming of the 8100: 1) camera quality, and 2) speakerphone. The 8200 sports a higher-resolution built-in camera. Picture quality is also improved. The old 8100's pictures often had streaks and distorted colors. The 8200's pictures look much better. The speakerphone is definitely a great addition for those of us who like to multi-task yet dislike headsets. The volume and clarity could be a little better, but given the compact size of this phone, it's not bad. Reception on the 8200 is great, thanks to its external antenna. Battery life is good, unless you save a lot of things in memory, which depletes battery faster the more stuff it holds. The phone is attractive and can be customized in many ways, not to mention it comes in three colors. To Sanyo, I suggest you use the iPod Mini color scheme, because not many people like big red! In summary, the 8200 delivers lots of improvements over the already-excellent 8100. If you have Sprint or plan to get Sprint, this is the phone. If you want video recording, check out the Toshiba phone for Sprint.",positive

"Because of low reviews across the board for 2.5mm to 3.5mm adapters, I ordered two adapters ""just in case"". I'm glad I did because the first adapter worked with my Bose Noise Reduction headphones, but the second only provided sound through one ear of the headphones. Alternatively, I tried both adapters using my Blackberry to play BB mp3s into the aux input of my 2008 Ford Escape. Both adapters only provided audio to the left speakers. I tried several 3.5mm to 3.5mm male to male cables to see if it was the cable, but all cables had the same results. I also tried to wiggle the adapters and cables to find an intermittent connection, but this did not yield any new information. The problem with the adapter is one of the following: 1) My blackberry (it works fine with Bose headphones so I don't think it is my BB). 2) My Ford Escape audio input (this works great with my ipod so it should be okay). 3) The 2.5mm to 3.5mm adapters (likely). 4) The manufacturing tolerances of the 2.5mm adapter may not be good enough for consistent performance across several devices. I can't say what the root cause of my problem was, but the adapters did not perform as well as I had hoped.",negative

"Pros: lightweight, overall sound quality Cons: connectivity issues, limited range (not 10m), some echoing, quirks I bought a couple of these today. Great headset but has a few misgivings that should be noted. I didn't see these cons from the many reviews I've read prior to buying the Z9i. Perhaps I wasn't as diligent as I'd thought. My initial thoughts are as follows. First, I've experienced some connectivity issues with the Z9i being on the opposite side of where my phone is located (i.e. pocket, purse, etc.). My Razr kept disconnecting and reconnecting throughout the day whenever my phone was on the opposite side of the Z9i. I decided to hold my Razr in my right hand while walking and wearing the Z9i on my right ear. It still kept disconnecting and reconnecting but only a couple of times. These devices were only 3+ FEET apart with no obstruction. Occassionally, I experienced hearing feedbacks/echoes of my own voice through the earpiece after I'd spoken. On 2 separate outgoing calls, the phone connected and the minute counter on my phone showed such but the Z9i remained silent. I had to redial on those 2 calls and the other party said their phone connected but they could not hear me. I did not mute the phone (pressing and holding the - volume button for 3 seconds). Max isolation reaction was ""Wow"" from the person I called after informing them my window was halfway down while doing almost 70mph on the freeway. The 2nd Z9i was for my wife who was with me. She was experiencing connection quirks and issues but didn't want to blame the Z9i until she performs her own controlled evaluation of her unit. Needless to say, the incoming sound quality appears to be very good for both of us. Clarity a plus. I didn't feel the need to rehash 'Pros' & 'Cons' already mentioned in other reviews. I just wanted to share my own experience and hope that others may have another insight into this product to help them with their own purchasing decision. Perhaps I'm being a tad critical to only award the Z9i 3 stars instead of 4 but with many rave reviews to its credit, I didn't expect these shortcomings that I experienced. Maybe I got a bad unit? My assessment was made after 7 hours of usage (active and standby) and 37 incoming and outgoing calls in total from my Z9i only. UPDATE: July 4, 2008 Assessment after a few days of usage. The range appears limited as explained in my initial post. When my Razr is in the pant pocket on the opposite side of the ear wearing the Z9i, Bluetooth disconnects & reconnects about every 1-2 minutes. Very annoying because you hear beeps every time this happens. Additionally, my Razr has indicated weak Bluetooth signals and suggested using the handset at least 8 times in the last 3 days during calls. This occured a couple of times when I was driving my car and wearing the Z9i on my right ear with the Motorola Razr less than 2 feet away near the gear shifter. The problematic silent connection (as mentioned initially) still persists. I had to redial a couple of times because the other party could not hear me even though both parties' phones showed a connection. One of my friend is also mentioning these problems with their Z9i to me. Their phone is a Sony Ericsson Z610i. I will begin troubleshooting (i.e. checking for software updates/compatibility issues with my Razr, etc) and issue another update in a week, if not sooner. These problems are becoming a hindrance. UPDATE: July 14, 2008 After almost 2 weeks of daily use, I am still experiencing all the problems I've detailed above. However, the disconnect-reconnecting issue is not consistent. In some areas (outdoors & indoors) it is frequent while at other times it behaves normally. It still occurs when I wear the Z9i on the opposite side of the phone. I did not have access to any other phones to test other than our Razr & Samsung T629. My biggest issue is the 'Bluetooth signal is weak. Use handset?' prompt. It is very frustrating to be driving when all of a sudden, my bluetooth connection is lost and I have to pick up the phone and try to switch it over to speakerphone. Sometimes when I'm not quick enough, it will re-connect with the Z9i again and the party I was speaking to would ask what happened. This has occured all too frequently for me and is posing a safety risk while I'm driving. My wife is also experiencing similar problems with her Z9i/Samsung T629 combo and doesn't use it (Z9i) as much since she hates to deal with these issues. My friend who owns the Sony Ericsson Z610i only experienced similar problems but they were very limited and she is 'satisfied' with her Z9i. As for my and my wife's Z9i, I will repack them and auction them on ebay as soon as we find a better alternative. This is only our experience. It may be our phones, frequency interference, etc... any number of factors we may not know about. Apparently several users are very happy with their units. It would be nice if those who posted positive reviews would come back & provide updates so we could better assess this product. Good luck everyone! Drive safely.",neutral

"ordered two of these as we both needed new bluetooth headsets.....was intrigued by the idea that we could use these for both a phone call and to listen to music....keep in mind that neither of us are people that walk around with the headset on 24/7 and we generally use it for car commutes only.....the only real complaint is that the earbuds REALLY cancel out noise (this is my husbands complaint, not mine) and he can't hear what is going on around him.....in addition, the controls for volume are a little difficult to use as they are oddly placed (and we both apparently have caveman sized fingers?).....otherwise, they seem to be pretty nice, good sound quality and the seller shipped pretty quickly and item arrived as described.",positive

"Product is as advertised and there is nothing wrong with it, but I am not crazy about it. Not easy enough to get to ringing phone and get it out fast enough.

"My old Nokia almost never dropped a call, but my new Motorola V330 can drop from 1 to 4 calls per day, in the same area, with the same service provider.

It would be better if this button was protected, like the key pad is.",neutral

"Just got these this past weekend. The headphones are made well, and pretty comfortable. They paired up with my blackberry 8320 curve in a matter of seconds after the initial 2 hour charge of the headphones. The sound quality on music and calls is acceptable but not exceptional. The bluetooth does not transmit signal with 0 distortion. there is an underlying distortion (barely noticeable) when playing music even at a low volume. People understand me on phone calls but it is apparent to the other person that i am using some sort of device by the ""boominess"" of the call. I would not have kept these if they were still priced at the $80 - $100 they originally hit the martket at, but for $40, i'll hold on to them. If you are very picky about sound quality, and are looking for high performance, look elsewhere.",neutral
"This product rarely works properly. It needs to be powered off and back on between each call. Even power cycling the product it rarely actually works.

"I love Eneloop batteries because they last forever and hold a great charge, but this set doesn't come with C and D *batteries*, per se - it comes with these casing things that your AA battery fits into, which then fit into a C or D slot.

"This is a great phone for those on a budget (like me!) It's one step down from the v400. So if you can afford it, get the v400 instead! The v400 has a ton of included themes and photos, and more memory (5 MBs) compared to this phone, which is sort of ""bare bones"" (1.8mb). Both have the same quality camera and photos, although the v400 has a better screen. Both phones can have .mp3's playing as ringtones. The v220 has very clear sound quality, great screen and excellent battery life. My only problem with it is that there is NO SUPPORT from motorola for a data link cable. The V220 connects via a small USB plug, but you have to order the datalink software & drivers from motorola before you can use it (another fourty bucks! And Cingular didn't stock it, only Motorola does, on a very remote part of their site). I got my software on a file-sharing program because I've NEVER heard of a company charging money just for DRIVERS!! All-in-all I'm loving my new phone (I've had it for several weeks). I've been able to get rid of my palm pilot because it holds 1,250 contacts (with the Simm Card). One note - if you add your contacts to the phone's memory (as opposed to the Simm's) you will have to set the ringer for each contact or else it defaults to no ring). The motorola software also allows you to sync to your Microsoft Outlook contacts and calendar, and it was truly easy to use! This phone is a great way to feel like you've got tons of money, because it's basically just a ""baby"" version of the v400 (which retails for about $150 more usually). It's a good buy, and on Amazon right now with their rebate, you actually get money BACK for buying the phone! If you have any questions about the phone that I haven't answered here, feel free to AIM me at WinterGetsMe. If you like my review please vote for it! ~ Michele",positive

What they didn't include was they mean a call coming in on your paired CELL PHONE. I'm not happy and feel duped. It should be extremely clear that it wasn't designed to work with Skype on your computer -- it doesn't so don't bother if your a Skype user.",negative

"The product offered some improvement in reception . Prior to installation we were getting 1 to 2 bars inside the house with very limited to no reception on AT&T iPad data plan and net10 cell phone service. After the relatively easy install we are getting consistent reception from both networks (3+ bars) from approximately 15 -20 feet away from the amplifier. Moving within 2-5 feet of the amplifier generally results in a 1 to 2 bar (ie 4/5 bars) increase in reception. Although the product has solved our reception problem I would like to have had a bit stronger amplifier to improve performance when at the 20+ foot distance away from the amplifier. Overall, we are happy with the product. Amazon prime's express 1-day delivery was appreciated.",positive

"Quality: The improvement is not as big as I originally expected, but there is a noticeable improvement in the quality of the system. For those of you that still use a Wii, if you can get a good price for this item (anything under $7.00), then I would say it's worth getting this item. It's called ""HD"", but it's still far from the HD you see on television or other systems. It still, however, sharpens the experience. Usefulness: The cable is short, so if your Wii and TV are far apart, then don't expect to be able to use this. They have to pretty much be on the same shelf. It is shorter than the original cable that comes with the system, so you may have to make adjustments to the location of your Wii and/or TV. Overall: It's good for the price, the quality upgrade really isn't that high, but for a product that can be purchased for around $5.00, it does exactly what you expect it would.",positive
"The phone has a good and intuitive user interface, and lots of cool features. One of the features that drew me to it was the front LCD panel. Unfortunately, when taking pictures using the front LCD the images are mirrored. T-Mobile told me to suck it up. Another flaw is that if the time format is changed to 24h instead of 12h the setting will be reset if the phone is turned off. The third, and most annoying flaw, is that some WAP sites apparently cause the phone to restart. Except for these flaws, though, it is a lovely phone, and I would recommend it, even for other former die-hard Nokia fans.",neutral

Trying to set this thing up to have minutes was absurd and totally inflexible. It's a pay as you go, but you can't add minutes mid-month if you run out, your just SOL till you can add minutes the next month, no exceptions. After all the struggle with this ridiculous phone, we ended up getting a free phone from Verizon and adding her to our plan for an additional 5 bucks a month. All the kid features that I thought were fabulous about this phone (blocks all incoming and outgoing calls except for the ones you enter into the phone book) are standard on almost all phones these days, I just didn't realize. Overall this phone is a waste of money and materials. I'm sure your current cell phone company has something cheaper and better.",negative
I have owned this phone for about a year and am going to switch to a new phone once my contract expires. One week after I received my phone it would not turn on.

I previously (from another source locally) purchased what appears to be this exact case, knowing it was vinyl since I looked at it in person, and purchased it since I couldn't find one that fit my phone as well as this one in leather. It lasted about 2 or 3 weeks and the belt clip sheered right off of the case and dropped to the ground one day. So if you're a light user of your phone case, this may work for you.

"We have used our Nuvi 200 for the past six months travelling in our motorhome and in our Jeep. My wife (The Navigator) and I decided that on balance, the Nuvi has been a negative to helping us navigate. Many times, the Nuvi is spot on, and we glide to our destination. However, there have been enough ocassions where the gadget is wrong and misleading, delivering unwanted surprises and just plain erroneous information so that, at the end of the day, the negatives outweigh the positives. We cannot trust it's route calculations without double checking with Microsoft Streets and Trips and with the Highway Atlas we got at Walmart. A good example was a recent trip thru Houston from a campground west of there. The night before we left, the Nuvi said we should bypass Houston via the Sam Houston Toll Road. The next morning, the Nuvi had changed it's mind and directed us to take I-10 through the middle of the city instead. We hadn't moved the motorhome during the nite, so we can only assume the Nuvi was suggesting the change in route because of the positioning of the stars, or maybe it knew something about gas prices that we did not, or maybe it just felt like seeing some different scenery along the way. The Nuvi has tried to send us down two track dirt roads without warning, which might be ok if we are travelling in the Jeep, but certainly not in a Motorhome, and I would not have wanted to go down those roads with a regular car either. We have been led down narrow, winding streets in search of an address which turned out was a mile away on the opposite side of the Interstate. Perhaps other Garmin Navigators are better and more useful than this one, but based on our experience with the Nuvi 200, we aren't planning to spend the money any time soon to find out.",negative

"First of all, let me say this is a great phone. I will note a few important things: 1. It is a smaaal phone. The buttons are small. If you have a large hand or fingers, its going to be hard to grasp the phone properly. I have average hands and it was hard for me! 2. No Speakerphone...this is a huge downside. 3. There is an online button 'conveniently' accessable which can be mistakenly pressed and you'll never know you went online and you were being charged. 4. Camera sucks. It is a VERY BASIC one,... you have to be standing within 2 feet of the subject to get a recognizable picture. Pros: 1. Crisp, Large display 2. Sleek looking 3.

"This was my first bluetooth headset and after using it for a week I was very disappointed. The phone I used it with is a brand new LG Venus. It's major flaws was the lack of volume and the speaker clairity. In a quite room you the volume is ok, but in a car or noisy room the thing is worthless. It's too quite to be of any use. My other gripe was with the sound quality. It's subpar at best. The sound was fuzzy and unclear even with my phone on my desk two feet away. On full volume the sound also became some what distorted.

No easy access to quick exchange or loaner unit. No shipping refund even if unit was confirmed to be defective. I cannot recommend this unit as a result of poor customer service.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BlueAnt-V1-Bluetooth-Headset-Silver/dp/B001APH9GW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BlueAnt V1 Bluetooth Headset (Silver)</a>",negative

I ordered this set mostly for the cable since I was having synchronizing problems with my TX. What they sent me was not what is pictured. The cable hast no button and the wall charger is different too. I tried the cable and it did not work. Unfortunately returning things to amazon vendors is very hard. You lose the original shippment fee and have to pay for return postage and often a restocking fee. It's more efficient to save your energy and throw this stuff in the trash!,negative

"The Jabra BT-3030 is a good stereo bluetooth alternative to bluetooth headphones. They allow you to use your own wired headphones too, so you don't look like a completely silly. The bluetooth phone interface works well too and shuts down the music when you have an incoming call. Music comes back on after you hang up the call. I use it with a Blackberry Curve, LG Dare and an iPod with a iCombi bluetooth adapter. You can also connect to two devices at the same time. I connect to the iPod for music and the Blackberry for calls, at the same time. I recommend them with a good bluetooth signal. The iCombi is a barely decent bluetooth transmitter, so the BT-3030 doesn't always have the best sound.",neutral

"I use this kit when I travel to more rural places where signal is missing or weak, or deflected by metal. It works. Understand: it's not magic. You have to actually have signal running around up there to catch. It won't generate signal where there is none. But, duct tape this to a pole or long ladder, find the right direction, and get some bars. Probably, just enough bars to do the job. I use it where the location is down a hill, and inside a metal covered, metal roofed building, and the locale is far enough out into the hinterlands that the tower network is sparse. The kit is compact, too. Not cheap, but if you just must have signal, and you are going to experience signal down-time again, it's probably worth it. I knocked off a star because I think it ought to be about $100 cheaper.",positive
1. Screen is too dark(complaints from lots of users and i experienced first hand) 2. Camera is ok(not great but good for starters) 3.

It won't change your life but does give an additional signal strength bar and maybe that's the difference between make or receiving a call or not. It only costs a few bucks.,neutral
"goal: the loudest bluetooth speaker phone, the best of the best. i hate head sets. 1. i have owned the motorola T 305 for 2 years. with the new cell law in california, i wanted a hands free bluetooth speaker phone to make my ears bleed with LOUD, CLEAR, QUALITY volume, especially for freeway speeds and when i have my a/c on full blast, my window down and the radio on full blast, yes all at the same time as most people in los angeles. 2. the T 305 be called many things on amazon, but a motorola T 305 is a motorola T 305. the boxes may have changed, but that is all. the T 505 is a T 505 as well. 3. that said, the T 305 has only a small 1 watt speaker, possibly good for a cat or bat - i am neither. the T 305 is ok for quiet people, or people who do not have air conditioning on the highest fan speed, people who rarely use or do not have air conditioning, who do not smoke, do not have kids, never use the radio, never have passangers, never roll down their windows. if that is you, save the few dollars and get the motorola T 305. you will like the 1/one watt speaker and you will be happy. 4. the motorola T 505 has a 2/two watt speaker, enough to make my ears bleed which is what i wanted since i require a loud ring, and yes, i DO roll my window up to talk, but at least i can hear it ring at 75 mph! i am not hard of hearing, but with the window down and the a/c on full blast, i want a loud ring. TRUST ME, 2 WATTS IS MORE THAN LOUD ENOUGH - IT'S QUALITY/LOUDNESS IS MORE THAN JUST DOUBLE THE 1 WATT; 2 WATTS MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD. i do not know why, but it does. 2 WATTS WILL WAKE THE DEAD. 5. back on track, i bought the jabra sp5050, WHICH DOES NOT COME WITH A HOME CHARGER - NO JOKE! jabra's customer service was super, super cool. they even said they were adding a home charger soon and even sent me a free one. motorola's customer service, after you dial 23 prompts, is worthless, regardless of what continent you get sent to. an a+ to jabra's customer service. f- to motorola's. 6. ok, my experience just a few weeks ago was when i charged the jabra sp5050 (in my car of course since there is no home charger), just out of the box. i first loved the cool, stealth design. BUT that is all. i literally did a side by side comparison of the jabra sp5050 vs. the 1/one watt motorola T 305, had my partner call me from inside my home, and the jabra sp5050 was worthless. free or a gift, i would throw it away. BY ME IF FREE OR A GIFT- i would throw it away. i returned it in 2 hours. 7. spend the little extra, get the 2 watt motorola T 505. worth the money, calls can come in over a unused/weak fm frequency. since i am not a terrorist, i don't care if anyone can pick it up my stupid calls next to me in case they are listening to an unused fm frequency. is it perfect, no. i am not flying in a space shuttle or in a fighter jet. *****i would NOT recommend calling a credit card company, however.***** 8. even if you do not need the T 505 to make your ears bleed or scare you if you are deep in thought, the fm broadcasting feature of the incoming voice over an unused fm frequency is really cool. it is so smart, it tells you what fm station to pick. or, you do not have to use this feature if you do not want to. fyi, the speaker volume IS adjustable if you do not want your ears to bleed. the mororola t 505 is a V8 engine, for sure. *********************************************** if legal, i would marry the motorola t 505. ***********************************************",negative

"I bought this unit about a year ago, mostly because my sister had one and thought it was really good. Also liked the fact that it can't be turned on accidentally. When it arrived I tested it, and even though I could hear on it the person on the other end could not hear me. I tried turning it off and on, tried muting and un-muting it - nothing fixed it. Perplexed, I called Motorola customer service. They said they'd send me another one, but I had to pay to ship back the one I had - with a company that tracks it (way more expensive than regular USPS). The second one arrived - and had the same problem! I happened to notice on the paperwork that it was a refurbished one. So I called customer service yet again, and this time I insisted they send me a brand-new, in original packaging one. Once again I had to pay for the shipping myself, but at least the 3rd time was a charm. This one worked! Now, about a year later, suddenly the mic has gone out on this one. I handle the thing very carefully, it's never dropped or abused in any way. I have to say DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT!!! It is a waste of money, even my sister's is starting to malfunction now (different problem, though). I am very disappointed, I thought Motorola was a quality brand, which is why I looked at them in the first place.",negative

"This is my second Plantronics bluetooth. The first one is 510 which I purchased for my husband's Tmobile SDA, which we both love and have paired to both our phones. I just purchased this bluetooth couple of days back from a different store and not through Amazon. I did not see any reviews except for one so thought would share my take on Discovery 610. Very sleek and light weight. Plugged it to the power charger and in about an hour it was fully charged. The light stays red when the bluetooth is charging and when done the light goes off. I felt that the optional hook is a must as it doesn't have a firm hold on the ear without it, looks odd but is quite comfortable. I did not have trouble pairing nor making calls with my T-mobile MDA. The pairing was extremely simple and quick and have paired to two devices. The audio quality on both sides is pretty good. Does not have noice reduction so in quite environment it sounds very clear. The volume has to be increased in a noisy environment. The power button has multiple features, hold it for a while until you see the red light - this is for both on and off. The double click (two fast clicks) will redial the previously dialed number. You don't get a feel for the button when its pressed down so you have to hear the sound to figure out if you clicked it twice and the connections is in progress or not. I am yet to set up voice dial feature. Overall, I will recommend this bluetooth. For the price and the Plantronics quality it is a keeper.",positive

"The over-the-ear piece is a not a good fit for my ears. Moreover, they are extremely fragile and prone to breaking. Within 5 minutes of getting the phone out of the box, I broke the ear piece just trying to get the headset over my ear. I put the headset in my piece and bent the second piece. The plastic piece covering the control buttons seemed very cheap also, and I think it would be a matter of time before that broke as well. I generally take good care of my headsets and electronic equipment, so if the headset seemed fragile to me, it probably will for most. Also, as a woman with a small head, the headset just felt clumsy and big. On the upside, the acoustics seemed decent, but then I only used the headset once and decided to return it.",negative

"These are just OK. I like that the earbuds are small and theres enough room to turn your head side to side. My main issue is that the two stems seem to stick out too far. I like to rock these under my work shirt, but it looks like I'm a Borg from Star Trek because it sticks out in the back as well as the front because the unit is not flexible. It is a solid one piece unit. Other than that, they sound good and have pretty good range (20-30 feet, even with obstructions).",neutral
"I've had this for about 10 months. I really wanted something that sounded better than my iPod earbuds, so I ended up purchasing a pair of DT880 600ohm headphones. Of course, these need an amp to sound their best. After reading all the hype on sites like head-fi, I decided that the Magni 2 was worth a shot. First, it was pretty inexpensive for the supposed quality. Second it is made in the USA (not required, but nice). And third, I figured that I could always sell it if I didn't like it. Pros: 1. The Magni 2 has a very nice sound, overall. 2. It drives my DT880 600ohm headphones without a problem. 3. The unit looks really nice (this is subjective). 4. It feels solid and is heavy for it's size. 5. It is not nearly as hot as some people claim, which was a nice surprise. Maybe this changes from unit to unit?? Cons: 1. The Magni 2 got pushed off the edge of a 17 inch tall ottoman onto a carpeted floor. Now it's dead. Won't power on... nothing. Seriously? It has never been dropped before, and has hardly been moved off my desk. I know it is not meant to be bumped around, but wow! In contrast, my girlfriend dropped my iPad and it tumbled down some stairs and it still works great. The Magni 2 feels solid, but apparently that is NOT an indication of durability. 2. It has a discernible level of hiss once I get past 12 o'clock on the volume control. If you are not sensitive to hiss, no big deal. But I hate noise and hiss. It was not a deal breaker, because most of the time I listen at low levels. But it was irritating if I wanted to turn it up. 3. The amp is a little ""bright."" Not a big problem, but it can get a little tiresome after listening for an hour. I think the Magni 2 is worth the price. If a little brightness and/or hiss doesn't bother you, it should serve you well. I would recommend being really careful with it! Without it breaking so easily, I would have rated it 3 or 4 stars. For the record, I do NOT expect Schiit to fix this for free under warranty. I understand that it was dropped. Now I am just waiting to hear back from Schiit about repair cost. It may not be worth fixing. We'll see! UPDATE 9-13-16: Schiit wanted $80 to fix it, so I declined. I think $80 is a fair price for the repair, but I only paid $119 for the amp so it just is not worth it. I'm going to save that $80 toward a new amp!",negative

"I am coming off about 2 years of using first the LG-700 Bluetooth headphones and then the LG-730's. I liked both sets although neither pair held up well to my daily use as both phone headset and music headphones at gym. After misplacing the LG-730's which had started to malfunction, I picked up the Motorola Buds SF500 White at Best Buy with minimal Amazon review checking. Unboxing I had to charge as it appeared dead out of the box, but it charged pretty quickly. After familiarizing myself with the controls, I paired with my iPhone 4s. This first pairing went smooth as expected and I could easily play and navigate music on the iPhone. After a few minutes of use I noticed the small buds kept falling out of my ears so I swapped to the medium size buds. These fit fine and with the fit came a somewhat noticeable increase in sound quality as the medium sealed in my ear better. I have read reviews that others have had the same poor sound result with bad fit, and I would recommend that the first order of business with these headphones is to swap the buds to get the proper ear fit. Then I attempted to make a phone call. First attempt was met with a voice response: ""EQ Changed"". The user guide suggests that the same button press combination will change the EQ and place a call. Apparantly if music is on, holding down the Play/Call button will change the EQ. If music is not on, holding down the button is supposed to invoke Siri. It does not on first attempt. It ALWAYS changes the EQ, like it or not. The second press and hold will invoke Siri. Annoying for sure, but not a deal breaker, especially as the SF500 give no indication as to what the EQ might be set to anyway. Next issue I encountered is pairing. The user guide gives NO indication how to unpair a device from the headset itself. There is a reset operation that is invoked with a press of the Play/Call and both Volume buttons simultaneously. I have yet to achieve a reset via this method. Big Fail. I am forced to unpair from my device iPad/iPhone/Macbook before I can pair to another. I found myself at the gym today with my child in kid care with my ipad and my headphones were paired to it. They could not be unpaired. I got to hear Clash of Clans being played on my ipad from about 100 feet away and not the music on my iphone 2 feet away. The good news, I guess, is that the range is much better than either LG set. When it is paired, I really like the fit and the stiffness of this headset over the LG. I suppose if you have a bigger neck the fit could be a problem, but I frankly forget I have it on. The sound is marginally better than the LG-700 and much better than the LG-730, which was never that great. Call quality seems to be OK when I can get past the ""EQ Changed"" annoyance. The fit becomes a bigger deal as you start to exercise. The LG's would fall off due to their flex-y nature. The SF500 seems to stay in place well due to the stiffness. So good sound, good fit, annoying controls.",neutral

"I bought the Jawbone right when the first model came out. It had its problems (ear pieces broke easily but Aliph sent me a second set free.) Once I got it adjusted, it worked great. Much better than any headset I had tried. The Jawbone II came out about the time my Jawbone I got wet in a downpour and was ruined (my bad). The Jawbone II was so light I could not feel it on my ear. I was never sure it was in my ear and on my cheek at the same time. When I would adjust this very small unit during a call to get the button on my cheek, I invariably also touched the adjacent on/off button and cut off the caller. Too quirky to suit me. Then it simply fell off my ear while I was out shopping and was gone. $130 down the drain. I am going back to Jawbone I. The volume control in II was nicer if you did not cut the caller off by accidentally touching the off switch. I don't think the new model is an improvement; on balance I think it is a step backward.",negative

"This is my first BT headset, so I do not have a comparison to make. However, the Soyo headset met all my expectations, and I am happier with it that a lot of owners of other BT headsets based on their reviews. I use it almost exclusively in my car to keep my hands on the wheel. It is easy to use, and connects automatically whenever it is in turned on. Also, if I leave the vicinity of my phone, the headset beeps to warn me, and it automatically reconnects when I'm in range again. I've seen others complain about reconnection, but mine has been absolutely automatic. Even if I transfer an active call to my phone, the headset will reconnect to receive the next one. Voices are clear to me and mine is clear to others. I bought one for my wife, and recommended it to my brother who was using a Motorola (don't know the model, and I'm a big Motorola fan, so I'm not bashing)that was much more expensive, but giving him problems. He is much more happier with the Soyo, though he says the range is not as good. This is not a problem for me, as I rarely use this at home or work where I may walk away from the phone. You can buy several of these, as they will not interfere with each other when used for different phones; I've seen three work flawlessly with their resepective phones in the same room. The headset is very comfortable. It also includes a corded microphone that clips to your collar. I have not tried this option, but my brother's girlfriend uses hers this way and likes it. The ""ear hanger"" is detachable so you can reverse it for left or right ear use, but I have found the headset will suspend in my ear from the earbud. It will easily fall out if you're moving around, but is perfect for me in the car as I leave it on the seat, and can quickly put it in my ear when the phone rings. It's also good to let the kids use it this way when grandma calls, because their ears are too small to work with the hanger. The flashing blue light is annoying as others have said. It draws attention to you when you're walking in a crowd, is a distraction to people in a face-to-face conversation, and is annoying in the car at night. For the 1st and 2nd reason, I use mine in the car exclusively. For the price, you can try it, and give it to your favorite teenager if you don't like it.",positive
"I was motivated to buy this headset after having done some research online. Even though it's relatively simple to use and the range is really great, the sound quality is poor. The set can be within 2-3 feet away from the phone, and quality at times is really pathetic. The set cuts off about 1-2 seconds at the beginning of a new call, and the sound drops on and off for a split second here and there. The sound quality I get reminds of the early days voice over IP when using dial-up. I tried the set on both LG VX-8600 and VX-8300 - the sound issues are nearly the same, though I'd say it tends to work better with VX-8300.",neutral
"I bought the iPAQ h6315 about 2 weeks ago. I mainly wanted something that I could use as my everyday cellphone, a decent handheld for contact/note keeping, something to pass the time surfing the internet, and something that I could use a bluetooth headset with. I had several problems immediately. The first is that the Jabra headset would not connect. I was told it was incompatible by the HP company, and was given a list of other headsets that were compatible -- two headsets later, still could not get it to work. Apparently it's a pretty common problem from what I've read online. It also froze fairly often, requiring ~ 4 soft resets a day. Although theoretically you are not supposed to lose any info on soft resets, I lost my contact list several times. I had problems with phone reception in the middle of downtown Washington, D.C. Friends who also had TMobile had good reception standing right next to me, leading me to believe the reception was a problem with the machine itself, rather than TMobile. On the good side, the WiFi worked well, and the handheld (other than freezing up) in general worked well. The screen had a nice resolution, and was a nice size. Pros: - Nice WiFi - Decent handheld applications Cons: - Frequent soft resets needed, occ lost info. - Bluetooth would not work with multiple different headsets - Poor reception in area that had good TMobile signals for others. - A little big, especially with the keyboard attached. I returned it. I spent too much time working with the thing, and was getting mediocre to poor results. I decided to wait until the Treo Ace will come out (this month? next month?).",negative

"From package and the item itself, I can see that it is a very high quality made and it is amazingly small. HOWEVER, It does not sync my iPhone and iPOD.

Since I'm from oversea, it is not convenient to return and exchange......",negative
OKAY,neutral
"I like that it is small but it is not as strong as other magnet mounts and barely holds up an iphone4, and the metal plates are much thicker than other magnet mounts (I used a thicker one because it didn't hold nearly enough with the thinner ones, and the thick one is supposed to be a little more of a hold. It does hold slightly better, but honestly I'd rather have a stronger magnet (I placed the metal plate directly on my device and cut a hole in my case just so I could get it working, as I only use this iphone as an MP3 player.) I have a newer phone that is larger and heavier (6+) and it just doesn't even come close to sticking to this magnet, even without a case with the plate directly on the back of the device. Compared to the other magnet mounts this one is just barely usable. At least it wasn't super expensive (I'd have returned it but I already threw away the packaging and with the penalty for packaging it wouldn't even be a half refund so I didn't bother)",neutral

"This is the second little bluetooth headset I have had. I thought I'd wait a couple of years and try again. Some of the problems I am having with this device may have to do with my sprint service and/or the cell phone; that is, I have had interference noise and also people have reported that I sound like I'm in a tunnel. Also, I have occasionally heard buzzing through the set. This is not all of the time. I am happy with the ease of use and also with the comfort. It is light and can stay in my ear a long time before it gets annoying. The device holds a charge for a long time.",neutral
"I received this product as a gift ordered from Amazon.com. I was pleased for the most part with the features and analog sound quality. Since the A2DP profile is not available for many devices yet, I cannot make use of the Bluetooth stereo connectivity that this phone allows. I have an LG VX8100 by Verizon, which is a great phone. I just wish I could find a great binaural bluetooth headset/headphone that works completely in stereo or at least provides a 3.5 mm to 2.5 mm adapter that would allow me to listen to the mp3s on my phone through the headset. I would have been able to live with the few limitations of the device until I realized that there is a design flaw that will no doubt affect anyone who purchases this headset. I noticed a hairline fracture on one side of the headset after less than two months of careful use. The single fracture became a dual fracture on the same side and I realized I needed to return them for a replacement. I figured this was a design flaw but I liked them enough to try another pair. Lo and behold, the same thing has started to happen again. I cannot give an otherwise very good product a formidable rating when there was so little emphasis placed on the design and durability factor of a headset that costs over $100. Now I just want a refund so I can purchase a Motorola HT820 and DC800 adapter. At least it looks like Motorola thought about making a product that can be used without having to worry about it breaking on them every time they wear it.",negative
"This is a third headset I own. Bought it to go with the new Treo 750. I must admit, my own fault - paid too much attention to all the ""military-grade"" hype. This is the WORST of the three sets I owned. The last one, Motorola 850, I think, was WAY better. In order to have it even attempt to work as advertised, the white button on the side facing your face must be in tight constant contact with your face. It must be essentially compressed by your face. For that to happen, the headset must fit well and sit securely in/on your ear. Neither one of those things are possible, at least for me. FYI: I am no known for strange and unusual anatomy, including ears and the rest of my head! To elaborate, the earpiece (the one going inside ear canal) does so very loosely. That does help comfort, but it does not assist in holding the headset well-positioned. The worst part of design: the earloop--a flimsy hook-shaped wire that loosely hangs on your ear. That is the ONLY portion meant to not only hold the headset on your head but to ensure that it constantly presses on your cheek/upper jaw. Remember? The ONLY way this devise does it's ""military-grade"" voodoo is by sensing the vibration from your jaw when you speak. It then presumes that vibration corresponds to your speech and separates it from other noises in background. So... No tight fit from the headset hanging via wire hook on your ear means ineffective filtering, which in turn means people still can't hear you!!! Back to square one, except now I'm out of $115. That is not all. In order to position that hook around your ear, you engage the end of it behind the ear and then turn it in circular motion to wrap around as tight as possible, trying to establish a good solid cheek contact. Well, two weeks of that--each and every day--and the earloop hook snaps at the base, leaving you with the headset in your hand. I must admit, the manufacturer sent me a replacement right away and I received them a week later--free of charge. One week without a bluetooth headset, and I am back in business. It's a good thing they sent 3 replacement ear loops--without my asking for that. Another one broke today. Think this is it? Hardly. Try charging that thing, and once you're done, try disconnecting it from the charger cable: the base cover of the headset comes right off and stays attached to the charger cable. Each and every single time. Now, I consider myself very mechanically inclined and I rarely need to hire someone to fix things around the house. But for all intents and purposes, without holding the headset at the base with large pliers and only then pulling on the cable to disconnect it, there is NO way of keeping that plastic cover on the headset. That is why I know what the inside electronics hiding behind the base look like! My summary: stick with the brands that have been doing this for years. I don't care if you're a Jabra or Motorola fan. Just stay away from Jawbone unless you're looking for a true toothache.",negative
"Pro - Decent sound quality Con - HORRIBLE battery life. The battery life voice says ""More than 5 days of talk time"" and counts down to ""More than 4 days..."" then ""More than 3 days..."" then it's dead. I think the designers made a huge mistake -- they meant to program it to say ""Less than 5 days of standby time..."" then a day later ""Less than 1 day of standby time left."" The standby time is that bad. Be prepared to charge it every other day or so which is an enormous pain in the neck. More often than not, the unit is dead on my visor. My previous Motorola hands-free speaker (TX500) would last a LONG time on a charge. Worse, the Roadster Pro won't even take a full charge overnight when charging on the cigarette lighter power port. To get a full charge, I have to take it into the house and use a more powerful charger with micro-USB cable. After owning this unit for several months, the Bluetooth connection is becoming unreliable. Sound is initially choppy and garbled after first connecting phone to Moto unit, but it improves after several minutes. Placing the phone very close to the Moto unit helps a bit (inches) rather than feet. I really wanted to like this item based on my experience with my Moto TX500 which claimed ""the longest standby time with up to 6 months, and the most talk time with up to 45 hours"" -- and lived up to those claims. I was hoping for improved sound quality and equivalent battery life, but I am extremely disappointed. Don't waste your money on the Roadster Pro unless you do not mind charging the thing up every couple days and having a dead battery when you need it the most.",negative
"This bluetooth unit works great (from this seller - another I purchased elsewhere had a cpl of minor issues) - no complaints about the functionality, sound , pairing or anything.

"This thing is about as small as they come, but it still delivers great clarity on both sides. Friends claim that the clarity on their end is as good or almost as good as if I were speaking directly into the phone. My one complaint is that it's very hard to get it to fit snugly into my ear. Since it doesn't have an ear loop or anything like that (which I life) I wish it would have some way of ensuring a snug fit in the ear. It has fallen out on me a couple of times and i never quite feel like I have a good ""seal."" Other than that it's a high quality product.",positive
"I was minutes away from ordering this phone on Amazon. It looks amazing. Trouble is, it does not have the proper 3G antennas for United States 3G (AT&T). So you will only get EDGE speeds unless you are out of the US (Europe, etc). Everything else on the phone will work just fine, but 3G will not. Just a heads up if you missed the mention of no USA 3G in the description. I just got the N95-4 instead so I could have 3G. The camera on the N82 is much better, but I can't stand EDGE data. Too slow. If you are on T-Mobile in the states, or don't care about 3G, the N82 is the phone to get!",neutral
"I bought this phone when my Audiovox 8500 was stolen. The 8610 is generally a step up from that older model. It has a nice color screen. Menu navigation is easy, and it was no problem creating contacts and single-digit shortcuts to frequently called numbers. Reception and sound quality during a call are excellent. Although this phone is slightly bulkier than the 8500, it's still very small and easy to tuck into your pocket. The phone has the option to choose from several ""desktops"" for different looks on the screen. The ones Virgin Mobile preloads are generally pretty dumb looking, but no harm done. The phone also allows for a choice of screen savers, but Virgin Mobile only has one installed without an option to get more. It's a silly feature, anyway -- a cell phone doesn't need a screen saver. Oh, and don't forget, it comes preloaded with two games. One is sort of like Tetris. I don't use them, but my wife thinks they are all right. Virgin Mobile itself has very good customer service, and their pay-as-you-go setup is good if you don't make a lot of calls. They stand by their phones... if yours stops working under warranty, they will replace it without hassle. Audiovox has improved the ringtone quality from the previous model. Now the tunes sound good, not embarrassing, and you can also get sound effects and even voices yelling at you to answer the phone. (Of course that option will annoy everyone around you!) They even have a plain-sounding ring tone you can use, which believe it or not, the old 8500 model didn't have! My one big complaint is that the ringtone doesn't get loud enough. I can hear other peoples' cell phones ring all the time on the bus, on the street, etc. But with the Audiovox 8610, if there's any ambient noise, forget it, you probably won't hear your phone ring even when it's set at maximum volume. I use the ""ring and vibrate"" setting to help make up for this. Aside from the soft ringtones, I like this phone a lot and I recommend it! UPDATE: Nearly two and a half years later, this phone is still going strong. It looks completely beat up from being carried around in my pocket, but it's never failed me. There are newer and more feature-filled phones on the market, but for the basics, this one is still a winner!",positive

"I recently purchased the HS850 since it came highly recommended but it turned out to be a disappointment. Just as others have mentioned, the headset doesn't fit well for all people. I felt I had to barely hang it on my ear to get the speaker low enough to be able to hear the caller. Even then, you can't get the volume loud enough to comfortably listen to the caller while driving. If you are using this headset in a car, you'll find that the volume is never loud enough and the fit is so loose that your afraid your going to fling the headset off if you turn around to change lanes. Of course, you can do what most driver's do that are talking on cellphones...merge anyway and let everyone else get out of the way.",negative

This this is pretty decent but don't think you are going to be a private eye and click this under someone's bumper. The globe logo end HAS TO have full line of sight to the sky. You can see how big it actually is. That said it works good on a roof or the edge of a bumper or maybe by the windshield wipers. Before you buy it check where you would mount it. The magnet is pretty strong. There is a a visor clip for nonsecret monitoring. It will only track a trip for 8 hours of actually in motion. Any more then that and the batteries die. They may last longer if a car stops over night or something. So plan on changing the batteries EVERY DAY. The good news is the data is very powerful. It totally links to Google maps so you can click on a stop and see the exact location including the street view. This is a ton of data generated every trip is samples every few seconds so you have to scroll to see the stops but you can also very easily export to Google maps and see the trip perfectly. My next one I would buy one with a 360 antennia. Which probably costs more.,neutral

"This product has ""cheap"" and ""poor design"" written all over it. It does work -- your iphone will be attached to the windshield. But even with all three (three!) very ugly arm parts attached, it cannot achieve enough bend to get the iphone aligned with your eyes. In other words, it doesn't handle the slope of a typical windshield. Bear in mind I'm using mine on a truck, not a race car, so there's not much slope to begin with. The cheap plastic does not flex, but the whole contraption bounces when the iphone is in it and you're driving down the road. Very distracting if you're using the GPS function, as I am. The audio cable that comes with it the cheapest quality I've ever seen, and short. I haven't used the secondary mounting device (glue a disk to your dash, apply the suction cup to that). Using this would probably solve the angle issue, but is no use if you intend to move your iphone and mount between cars. Generally a sad effort.

"It was less than a month after receiving this item that the ""leather"" peeled away from the dividers in the device tray. Shortly thereafter the dividers themselves came loose from the backing. The ""leather"" then started to curl away from the corners where it is folded to wrap around the outside edges on the back, well on it's way to complete structural failure due to shoddy glue. I've attempted to repair it with various adhesives, but with no luck - the cheap, tacky, oily glue used to adhere the ""leather"" finish has permeated the pressed fiberboard that the item is made of and any solvent I would use to completely remove it so I could do a proper repair with new adhesive would cause the fiberboard to disintegrate.

"I got this phone as an upgrade to my old V300 model via T-Mobile about six months from the day this review was made. There are some things about the V330 that are better and worse than my old V300. For openers, the good things are that Motorola caught on to some of the quick key innovations that Samsung conceived for their phone brands available to Sprint customers: quick keys to access T-Zones and the camera are the two most prominent. Also, the V330 has Bluetooth capability, which I can't comment on since I don't have a wireless headset to take advantage of this feature. Those are the advantages to the V330 over the V300. My disappointments with this phone compared to the V300 is that whenever I am reading or writing a text message, it is interrupted whenever new ones come in. I never had that problem with the V300, and Motorola needs to work out that issue with all their current and future models immediately. Of course, the only application that incoming SMS and MMS messages will not interrupt is use of Java-based gaming applications. Also, whenever several text messages come in, or even at unexpected times, outgoing text messages will not transmit to the recipients; the phone has to be turned off and back on, and then each outgoing message has to be manually resent. This too is extremely inconvenient, and is yet another issue Motorola needs to immediately resolve; otherwise, I may go back to buying Sony Erricson phones as I have never had such problems with their earlier models. Overall, the phone is decent. It is not superb. It will be once the recommended improvements are made.",negative

"I used to close my mind on Motorola products for the last perhaps 10 years and now I am liberated. The last one I owned was MPX-220 smart phone. It was a piece of junk, not only because of its low voice quality but because of its low reliability. I had to get it shipped to customer services 4 times in a year. Now what about this little gadget. It is great. I searched several top products on the market and this one is the top. I am very pleased with it. I even configured it to work with my Bluetooth GPS. With the quality of sound/speaker it has, I am pleased with all the aspect of this phone. I feel that I can wait till the real next generation of Mobile phones to have the same power as the latest pc.

I really feal that I now have a very good phone with very clear voice quality, good GPS, good viedeo camera, good PC that has all the connectivity methods avaialble (WiFi, bluetooth, Infrared, 3G, USB, ... whaat else you need), Good Pocket PC (PDA).. I am happy with it, overall.",positive
"The good: Nice sounding unit, with decent pseudo-full-duplex ability (sorry, it's not real full duplex, most speakerphone technology is not due to the complexity of creating digital ""hybrid"" duplexing networks, but it's good none the less). Get the mic as close as possible to your head for maximum effectiveness. Ergonomics are good, operation is intuitive and easy. Plumbing your handsfree kit through the car stereo is the only way to go, like this kit does. But that can involve a fair amount of wiring, so if there is a wiring harness available for your car, consider it money well spent. Works well with my HTC Touch phone. Since using a touch screen phone while driving down the highway is the epitome of a Bad Idea, having the Touch play well with the Parrot is a nice thing. The bad: Works really badly with my LG UX8350 flip phone, to the point of not usable. The Parrot incessantly beeps and continuously makes odd noises after one makes a call with this phone. I must shut off Bluetooth to make it shut up. Tried various suggestions from the Parrot tech support folk, with no improvement. The ugly: Updating the firmware in the Parrot is a maddening experience, combining the worst of Bluetooth, Windows, and voodoo magic. Version numbers of their firmware run bass-awkwards, so forget using any sort of logic to decide which firmware version you should be using. The dealer didn't have the appropriate cable to perform firmware updates, which struck me as both the logical way to perform an update as well as something basic a dealer just might have. This of course was precipitated by the problems with the UX8350, which culminated in Parrot's tech support telling me that I was LYING about implementing their recommendations (I'm not being hyperbolic here: they really did accuse me of not performing their very simple yet ineffective suggestions). Uh, okay. Didn't mean to offend the Parrot gods! Summary: Decent widget, assuming it works properly with your phone. Research on the web regarding your particular phone before purchasing. Buy from a dealer with a good return policy. Do not put up with any peculiar behavior; return ASAP to your dealer. It's not going to get better!",neutral

When I first opened the package the first thing that struck me was how flimsy the neckband of these headphones felt. It almost feels like it will crack at any moment if it gets bent too far or something rests on it a bit too hard. Then I charged them up and synced them with my phone (HTC Touch) and I was blown away. The quality of the sound is as good if not better than the sound comes through wired headphones. The bass is impressive and crisp. All in all these are a good set of headphones but I just wish they made them feel a bit more sturdy.,positive

"Purchased this after a lot of amazon reviews. The sound quality is as described (positives) in most of the reviews, and very happy with mine in all situations (street, wind noise, driving highway speed noise, and even in my convertible top down at city speeds). Jawbone ""Fit"" problem that most people report could have easily been corrected by treating the ear-loop as an adjustable eye-wear and hand-adjust for a good fit. I had a initial problem also -- the ear-loop wire was too close to the top of my ear and was uncomfortable to wear after a few min. Here is a simple guide. 1. Take the ear-loop off. 2. Find the ear bud that fits your ear, both comfortable and would actually hold the unit on without the ear-loop. That size would provide both the tight enough and comfortable fit. 3. Put a ear-loop on. Start adjusting the top so that there is no to little pressure to the top of your ear. I found that ear-loop sizes makes very little difference (included large, small, etc sizes are too similar to make a difference anyway). 4. Then bend the ear-loop toward to unit so that it provides support on the back -- but no need to go for a exact or tight fit. If you had used wire-frame eye-glasses, you should be familiar with this process. 5. The key steps are the #2 and #3 above. Should not take you more than a few minutes to get the comfortable enough fit you need, and forever to get that perfect fit (just like eye glasses). ======== Not related to ""fit"" problem, but Quality of my unit ==== - Update after 2+ weeks of use. - Too bad I cannot change the 5 star rating down to some lower # based on this updated experience. The fit (as adjusted above) and sound quality has been great. The Problem with my Unit: My unit shuts down randomly, almost regardless of the battery status (I have hade my unit charged near full, since I was not traveling during this period). Most often during a call, and seldom during standby. Once the unit shuts down, it behaves as if the battery has run down and would not turn back on, for up to 15 mins (did not try after that). But after an hour or two, the unit could be turns on and operates for a few more hours (and for even 1 hour conference call). So this is not clearly run-down battery problem, but something else. Now for the Aliph (the MFGR) Customer Service: Called Jawbone directly, and they insist that the problem is my phone dropping the call. Now I explained that yes, this could happen if you have the phone in your pocket, and some keys could be pressed..., but it does not explain the case when I had the phone on my desk, nor explain why the unit would not turn back on (not just dropping the call, but shutdown), yet operate properly after a ~ few hours. The Customer Service insisted that this is not a problem with their unit -- would not even recognize the logical disagreement in the evidence I provided and their explanation. This problem happened about every other day with normal business use (~ 1 hour talk, ~15~20 calls, 6+ hour standby per day). BTW, I got to a live person to talk to in less than 1 min -- fairly positive and frankly impressive when I now normally expect menus, menus and more phones menus and no live person interaction for 10~20 min. I am returning the unit for replacement -- still like the sound quality and the fit. If the replacement behaves the same way as my current unit, I will be giving up on this unit and seek alternative. ============= Quick update on replacement -- the replacement unit (new) works flawlessly. Perhaps the quality problem discussed on this forum is true for this manufacturer for now...",positive
"Day 1 summary: Not sure yet. Sounds fine and functions normally but button press response is sluggish and its rigidity is hard to get used to. I bought this headset to replace my years-old LG Tone HBS 730 headset which I abused in every kind of way: running in heat, running in cold, running in rain, building the shed, skiing, conference calls at work, losing it at the bottom of my backpack for weeks (where it was repeatedly crushed by my laptop and other random gear). My opinion of the LG Tone 730s is pretty good. Durable, dependable, comfortable, easy to use. Sound quality for phone calls, podcasts, and books is great. Sound quality for music is just ok, basically due to the utter absence of bass, which is a common complaint about Bluetooth sound from iPhone users. I also owned the LG Tone HBS 700 -- which was just as good until my vacuum cleaner got it -- and the HBS Tone Ultra 800, which offered ""JBL Signature Sound."" That one had the comfort and ease of use of its siblings, but the sound was barely better and the headset dramatically shorted out one warm day when I was out on a run. My guess is that the little switch that activated the JBL boost (located where it touched my neck) was not watertight, sweat got in and bzzzt: the end. Anyway. This is not supposed to be a review of the LGs. Just giving context. The Motorola Buds look cool. I got the white/black option. I want to be able to put it around my neck and forget about it until I need it, either to take a call or listen to something from my phone. I want long battery life, imperviousness to weather, comfort whether I'm running or doing whatever, 20 foot range, decent sound in my ears, and for callers on the other end to not know I'm on a headset. Pros in terms of fit: - I like that the ""arms"" are thin, with the intent being that they'll lay flatter against my collar bones - Having the bulk on the back of the neck is not bad - Having the indicator light hidden in the back and only active on startup/shutdown is great - Overall pretty comfortable Cons in terms of fit: - I don't like that it's harder to feel when the earbuds are properly seated on their magnets when I try to put them away while still wearing them - I don't like that the power switch is ""press and hold"" style rather than a mechanical switch - The Play/Pause and Track +/- switches are confusing - I didn't like the LG either. I'd prefer the simpler way Apple does it on their earbuds - just one rocker switch with 3 positions: Down (one click for volume, two clicks for track), Do Something (one click plays music or answers call, two clicks calls last person (I think), click and hold gets Siri), and Up (one click for volume, two clicks for track). This I'll get used to. Good idea to have the main button have little grooves on it so you know you're in the right place by touch - I am not sure I can get used to how rigid the whole unit is. While it is tapered to curve around the neck and down the front, I'm afraid it is going to get skewed around my neck and look dorky as it's cocked off to an odd angle, which I won't realize because the whole thing is so light that I can't feel what's going on with it. The LG's bigger ""arms"" are heavier, which serves to hold them down and theoretically keep them level. Overall initial fit and finish assessment is that it's pretty good, but I'm not sure the fairly rigid plastic design works for me (I'm 5'9"", 160lb.) I like the look of the flat cables that go to the earbuds, but like every other pair I've tried with flat cables, the added bulk and rigidity detracts more from functionality than it adds to style. Specifically, to make the wires flat, they are bigger than they need to be if they were just round, and that added width means they don't have the same range of motion of a smaller more flexible round cable. This becomes important when you turn your head and the earbud needs to follow your ear. The bud is light, the cable only wants to move the way it can, and I've noticed the bud getting dislodged. I read other reviews having this same experience, and think it's due to the flat cable. Sound - Pros - Similar experience to the LGs on my iPhone and Mac. Words sound good, music sounds just ok. I'm willing to trade away the bass for convenience of wireless/small/light/comfortable though - Using the Skype Test Call, it seems like phone calls will be fine - clear and loud enough for me, clear sound for the person on the other end. Sound - Cons - Bass is thin no matter what EQ setting I choose - One thing I'm worried about is that the mic picks up too much ambient noise (typing, paper shuffling, etc.) This might be a big problem cycling, walking outside, or driving. Or typing while on a conference call Overall sound seems to meet my expectations, which were not high. I am worried about the mic noise. Price: Way cheaper than any competitors (at this time, March 2016). So there's that. I've only had my Motorola Buds for a day. I have lots of experience with its competition, and overall the Buds are almost as good and significantly less expensive so I'd recommend them for anyone wanting a stylish, comfortable, convenient, easy to use Bluetooth headset but who doesn't have super high expectations about sound fidelity or total finesse in build quality.",neutral

"I bought this unit about a year ago, mostly because my sister had one and thought it was really good. Also liked the fact that it can't be turned on accidentally. When it arrived I tested it, and even though I could hear on it the person on the other end could not hear me. I tried turning it off and on, tried muting and un-muting it - nothing fixed it. Perplexed, I called Motorola customer service. They said they'd send me another one, but I had to pay to ship back the one I had - with a company that tracks it (way more expensive than regular USPS). The second one arrived - and had the same problem! I happened to notice on the paperwork that it was a refurbished one. So I called customer service yet again, and this time I insisted they send me a brand-new, in original packaging one. Once again I had to pay for the shipping myself, but at least the 3rd time was a charm. This one worked! Now, about a year later, suddenly the mic has gone out on this one. I handle the thing very carefully, it's never dropped or abused in any way. I have to say DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT!!! It is a waste of money, even my sister's is starting to malfunction now (different problem, though). I am very disappointed, I thought Motorola was a quality brand, which is why I looked at them in the first place.",negative

"I bought this to install in my ski boat to inflate tubes. Unlike the picture, this is NOT a single molded device. It comes in several pieces. A flat mounting panel, a cylindrical receptacle, a plastic cover with tether, and a plastic nut. As a result of the stack-up, it does not end up flush on the mounting surface unless you cut a much larger hole than would be required for just the diameter of the receptacle. On the one I received, the mounting panel was not molded properly; there is only a very tiny edge (.025"") of plastic holding the nut on the bottom. I imagine that a strong tug upward on a plugged in device might break that edge. The attaching hole in the plastic tether is too small to nicely fit over the receptacle; you can stretch it to fit but I suspect it will tear in a few years. All in all, it looks like each piece was designed by a different person, in a different country, and no one checked to see if all the parts fit together before shipping to customers.",neutral

Even when I took the battery out and back in, it still did it. Then it stopped. The next day it did it again. I am taking it back today because its a terrible phone.

"I wanted to be able to watch tv late at night without having to disturb others in the house to I got these last week to pair with my motorola DC800 stereo adapter (which I first tried to pair with my laptop to stream music from my onkyo stereo to laptop as streaming from laptop to onkyo using dc800 already works flawlessly but I wanted to see if I could get away with not having to buy bluetooth headphone and instead stream sound to my laptop speakers and then use normal headphones on laptop but alas, it doesn't work that way). The pairing was smooth between both devices (this headphone and dc800) - just follow the instructions for both and it's easy. The sound quality is amazingly good. I had connected it with my dish network receiver and the sound was crisp and clear. This is consistent with the great sound quality I get with my laptop playing music and streaming to motorola dc800 stereo adapter attached to my onkyo. I also never got any signal loss or interruption even going to other room or kitchen with all walls around. No distortion of sound at all. Now comes the failing part due to which I have to return this product and instead go with the motola HT820 (which I hope offers the same quality of sound as this one without the construct flaws) - After having these headphone over my head for 1/2 hour my ears were HOT! I had to take these off the let my ears ""breath""! Secondly, these are too tight on the ears. My ears hurt after wearing for 1/2 hour use. It was uncomfortable wearing these so the whole point of watching tv for entertainment was lost 'cause I was more distracted by the strangling heat & pinching discomfort caused by these on the ears than enjoying the movie. And I don't have a big head. As a matter of fact probably a little smaller than the average. May be I'm not used to wearing DJ style headphones and may be these will grow more ""loose"" on the ears..I don't know 'cause I'm not going to wait that long. I wish they had made these a little less tight and perhaps with some ventilation without losing sound.",neutral

"I got this nav unit for a quick road trip that I had to do on my own. Having used various TomTom and Garmin units on prior occasions, it was difficult for me to decide which was the better deal (Garmin 200 or TomTom 3rd Edition). I finally settled for Garmin and have not been disappointed. Pros 1. Slim low profile unit. 2. Achieves satellites locks quickly and retains it for the longest time within tunnels and bridges. 3. Efficient routing. 4. Extensive POI database (though quirky at times! It once sent me half a mile past walmart and said I was arriving at Walmart as I reached an open wooded area on my right...) 5. Responsive Touch Screen. Though I do have issues with an alphabetic keypad for text entry. I am so used to the QWERTY that anything else is a hassle. By the way text entry is predictive (For example, you enter state as D-E- before you complete it Garmin Suggests Delaware) Cons 1. 3.5"" display might seem a little tiny. 2. No text to speech functionality. The lady mumbles ""Turn Right"" ""Turn Left"". You have to see the screen to check the exact street name that you have to turn into. I guess you will fet that for Nuvi 260 if I am not mistaken. 3. No Route Summary as text option. I love that option in TomTom. Its basically a list of directions with cumulative distances that looks like a Mapquest directions list. I find that good for planning your route when you want to avoid specific bridges or tunnels (with Garmin you have to thumb through each turn and it can get tedious). Bottom Line This unit works for me! I have been on the road pretty often having to re-route and find new places all the time. I find this a very handy GPS unit. Recommended if you don't have a lot of dough to spare.",positive

For a 5200mAh pack it drains quickly. I would have expected to charge my 2800mAh phone once with juice to spare. I'll get 1 charge from 20-100% and that's it. The flashlight and laser dot are gimmicks.,neutral
I'm a little klutzy and scratched up my phone a bit so I bought this cover to make it look new again. I knew for the price it might not be the highest quality but it was worse than I expected. The red did not match my phone and the color scraped off very easily by just being in my purse. The annoying part is I paid about as much in shipping as I did for this really cheap cover.,negative

"This is a very good product for the Samsung S5. The make and finish of the battery door, and TPU cover is very good and well crafted. The battery gave my old S5 a new life and has become my main phone again. I get over 38+ Hrs of battery life for mixed usage. This is far far better than my old standard battery that gave me only 8 hrs of usage. Good job folks@PowerBear! The battery charges up to 100% in about 2-3 hrs with a normal charger.

"The battery life of this product is fantastic. I can fully charge my Iphone 3gs allmost 5 times on one charge. Build quality of the unit could be better thogh and the plastic surface on the case scratches very easily. I had a permanent scratch on mine the first day that I owned it and now have several more (you can practically scratch it with your fingernail). Also the battery is a bit on the large side, but for the number of Mah you get I guess it's to be expected. I noticed a number of people having problems getting the device to charge, but its probably not the device. The cord that the manufacturer sends is very cheap and unfortunately proprietary. Even though the battery charges everything by usb, To charge the battery you need this proprietary cord. I myself save all kinds of stuff and actually had a cord that would charge it although I did try to have them send me another cord, but they wanted me to return the whole thing, which I thought was rediculous. I bought mine through DBROTH. So to summize; The battery itself is great. The charge cord is not, and the case is well..........imbetween. For those people stuck with this item and no working charge cord I have two words for you to ponder..........Radio Shack.",neutral

"I bought this motorola phone as a replacement for a defective phone that i bought a week earlier from amazon. I had the same phone before and i liked it that's why i ordered. This phone was for my mom to use back home. I received the delivery one day before her trip back to home, so i did not have the time to try it. It was again a bad phone: problem with the screen display that goes on and off without reason and a bad battery that lasts only 2 hours. I've a customer for amazon for a while, but my experience buying electronics frim them is really bad. AMAZON NEVER AGAIN. you ripped me off at least twice. Too bad that the phone is overseas now and it not even worth it to spend money to ship it to return it. Do not buy any phone from amazon. Period. This phones are not the same phone we have here in the US. I wish i could give -5 as a review.",negative
"I wouldn't say this is an outstanding piece of software but if you have some skills and some patience you can make it work for you. I think I paid 10 bucks for the software and the cable. I wouldn't shell out more than $20 for the setup. It is worth that price just for the cable and a shot at seeing if the software will work for you. I was able to syncronize outlook contacts and calendar with my V3 RAZR and I was able to download pictures off my phone, my two main objectives. That alone was worth the money. I downloaded the updates as well, and recommend doing it. I found out that if you set everything you want up in Outlook, erase the phone's phonebook (an option in the software before you synchronize), and then syncronize, it works best. You will lose your voicedials, but you just go back and redo them in your phone afterwards. My only issue is getting the software to communicate with the phone but once it does, you can get it to do what you want it to do.",neutral
"This product by no means really lived up to the others in its league, in fact if not for the simple design flaw, I will say it is arguably the king of 'behind-the-ear' bluetooth headsets! I have so far pre-Cardo, used the following: Motorola HT820; Nokia BH501; Blu-Ant X5 (the most rubbish product and a total waste of money - see my review on Amazon.com) and somewhere else. Now I am not a novice in this bluetooth headset design and usage - electronic design engineer and avid user of advance technology- so I am in good stead to qualify this product, and here I go... Bought product while in US about a month ago from Amazon, delivered with speed from Amazon.com (you guys are by the way competitively the best out there!). I was simply impressed with the simplicity but detailed transparent RRP box, on it, is a quick info on all buttons on the Cardo S2 so no need of reading huge user guides/manuals! On carefully opening the box, the slick headset was made with what I considered to be high quality rubber-like/plastic material which is highly flexible and friendly to the skin. Has a bit of charge in it to test it but manufacturer's recommended advice is charge for 4hrs before initial use - good advice. Lots of futuristic and practical functions and features e.g hold /lock switch which prevents accidental button push by ... your hat or head bandanna ;) ; integrated thumb-operated wheel rotate to enable your PDA's media player play, forward, rewind, pause... this feature is soooo cool! Another cool feature is it goes to sleep when phone is disconnected but once paired with any device (at least with my T-Mobile AMEO phone/pda), it always connected as soon as phone available without any action from you! this is the coolest feature for me. The quality of music is as loud and bassy as Nokia's BH501 (the best for this) but not as crispy-bassy as Motorola's huge (only downside by the way) HT820 - this is best for durability, longevity..mine is still going strong after 3 years of use, and speech through in-built non-protruding microphone, is better than the two best competitors - Nokia BH501 and Motorola HT820 - I stopped hearing from people's general complains of I can't hear you clearly... To the flaw...and yes there is just one but not unique to this product: Cardo's lower part of the thicker plastic that holds the speakers snapped! First encountered with Nokia BH501 disappointingly. If you look very closely where there a fine line (by design) across the ear hook, as you take the headset on and off, with unavoidable pressure always applied at these point, within a short time the stress becomes greater and ....crack goes the handle!!!! I have engineered this in my little lab reinforcing the 'bridge' with metallic object (embedded with soldering iron) to hold it firmly, going well so far.... S2 deserves 5/5 but for this design flaw, I believe they should re-visit this part of the design. In comparisons to others in its league then it is a force to be reckoned with. And it indeed has a good value for money. I will buy another shortly.",neutral
"I'm returning this item because it uses a micro, not mini, USB connector. Every accessory I have uses mini-USB including my cell phone.

"I like parts of the phone, but the flaws are so large, I wish I bought a different one. I'm not a fancy text-messenger or want all these super features, I just want a phone that's easy to use, that has a clock, and can do the occasional photo or text message. What I do like: 1. I like the inside layout/buttons. The buttons on the inside of the phone are easy to see, easy to press. 2. Nice bright display inside. 3. Clock display on the outside panel. What I don't like: 1. The stupid design of putting buttons on the side of the phone. You can't pick it up or hold it without pressing these buttons. I'm constantly changing the volume accidentally or turning on the camera - and then I have to change the volume back and turn off the camera. What a poor design choice. 2. The battery life. If you don't use the phone (like if it is just sitting on your desk), it is great. It lasts a long time. But if you actually talk on the phone, it drains the battery like crazy. I brought it with me when I went into labor. After the birth, it was doing fine. Full battery charge (according to the meter) but it was solid dead after a 1-2 hour conversation with my sister. 3. Not sure what I did, but the covering on the lens for the camera was cracked pretty immediately. I had my old Nokia bar phone for 2 years and it never cracked. Maybe it was something I did, or maybe this one is not as durable. Anyway, it works fine. I've had a few more dropped calls on this one than my old Nokia 3220 though.",neutral

"I love the size, form factor, and usability of this headset. Incoming sound is good. Unfortunately, the outgoing sound is a deal breaker. If there is any background noise, this headset will pick it up and transmit it just as loud as your voice. The DSP helps a little, but affects the sound quality dramatically (think overcompressed MP3). I am an attorney and need to talk to clients; I need to sound professional. Unfortunately, this $100 headset does not match the sound quality of a $25 wired headset with a boom mic. I am trying to modify mine by rewiring it with a boom mic from an [...] headset, but so far I have not gotten it to work. I am willing, though, to risk destroying the JX10 in order to have a chance at better outgoing sound.",negative

"I bought the BlueAnt ST3 months ago...Most people don't like to talk to me while I am on this device because they say it sounds really bad going out...Sucks too because it costs around $90-100. Anyway, I must say the voice quality coming in is pretty good, although as in some other reviews, sometimes the volume goes really loud, then really soft for no reason. There is some good potential with this device, just needed a little more time in development IMO. I read reviews before getting this, which at the time were only about 10 reviews. I probably would not get it again: Pros: -Functionally it CAN upload your phones phone book (only certain models -not listed). -Voice quality coming in is decent -Wireless. -Voice command dialing. Cons: -Bad other-end voice quality from what EVERYONE is teling me -Does not upload every phones phonebook...I am willing to bet that the list for UNSUPPORTED Phones w/ bluetooth is far higher than SUPPORTED phones to transfer the phonebook -Volume goes up and down sometimes for no reason. -Sometimes the voice answer doesn't work (even though this is normally a great feature) -It does read out the number (or name if stupid phonebook functionality worked) of the caller -Buttons can get confusing (even though there are only two it's another one of those, hold button for 5 seconds for this, 3 seconds for that, 1 second to call, 10 seconds to turn off, whatever...great there are only two buttons, but it's still difficult to remember how to do everything) Ok - so overall, I would not recommend getting this bluetooth device, unless you have first called someone who has it and have a listen for yourself..If you catch yourself saying ""I didn't get that"" or ""say that one more time"" or ""this device is junk"" more than 2 times, then it's garbage. HAHA...ok, this is way too harsh of a review...but I am just telling it how it is...I have heard good things about the cheaper BlueAnt light...for half the price - get that if you can live w/out the ""extra features""...I bought this cause I am a techy nerd, but it just doesn't support all the functions it CLAIMS and I have had on numerous occasions bad experiences talking using this device...AThankYouVeryMuch",neutral

"Update- July 2008- I have now had this product about a year, and am happy to report that after using it almost every day it is in great shape. It has held up very well, and still looks almost new. Original review: Even including the cost of shipping, this item cost me less than any similar items I have seen at the store. I have only had it for a couple of weeks, but it appears to be holding up well. I have a Samsung Sync, and it was kind of a tight fit at first, but after a few days of breaking in, it now fits snugly but comes out easily. Also (for the Sync, anyways) you can charge the phone while still in the case because there is open space on the side of the case. One thing of note is that the case is held closed by a magnet, not a snap. I actually like this better than a snap (easier to open and close, less chance of mechanical wear-out) but thought I would mention it because I don't think it says in the product description",positive

"The design original idea is great, but the design of the clip or the material chosen was wrong. The belt clip is very weak where it pivots on the pin holding the springs. For this material, the material thickness is too thin to take much stress without breaking where the pin goes through the pivot point of the hinge. I bought my first one and loved it right up until it broke, while I was stooping down to pick something off the floor. The phone was rotated 90 degrees from vertical to minimize pressure and stress on the hinge from the phone. It broke when I squatted down to pick up something and my iPhone 3G bounced off the floor at me feet. Luckily the fall was a short distance and the phone survived the fall, probably because it landed on an area of the phone covered by the case. When I saw the case on sale for $0.01 each, with $4.95 ea. shipping, I bought 4 so I would have a few back up cases when one breaks. I am already on #2 case, because the first one I used broke at the hinge pivot point just like my first one. I keep hoping I will get a stronger batch because I like the design. The fit of the phone is very tight with the face of the phone protected and is impossible to use if you try to put the face of the phone visible, but unprotected. It would be difficult to remove with long fingernails. The manufacturer needs this feedback; I hope Amazon forwards these reviews to them. I would not recommend this case until and unless the hinge is beefed up.",neutral

"Ok, so the bluetooth headset works and is relatively comfortable, easy to use, very good battery life (for occasional car use). Cons: The listeners can't hear me when I am in the car, and the same on my end as well. No or Too much noise cancellation :) that the other person can barely hear me. Going 60-70mph you barely hear the other end w/ the full volume. Conference calling feature is funky, you have to conference through the headset and if you do it via the phone the conferenced folks can't hear you. I can also vouch for outside bluetooth range, it literally has to be less than 4 feet away. I've had a Jabra for a while and LOVED it.

"I have owned this phone for exactly one year, and here is my report. About six months ago horizontal white lines began to appear on the LCD screen and, over time, the problem began to get worse and worse. Exactly one week ago I turned off my phone and allowed it to charge overnight. In the morning I turned the phone back on and discovered that I could no longer see anything on the internal display - it had whited out. This is a very common problem with this Samsung model and it is enough reason to stay away from it. Testimonies from other reviewers on this site, and others, corroborate this, but if you still want to take a chance on this model then you should be aware of some other potential problems that this phone suffers from. When you view a complete log of all sent and received calls whenever you press the Send button, scanning through them is a real hassle. Pressing a key once often cycles through three entries, and it's annoying when you want to make a call to a phone number in your log but the phone keeps overshooting it. Very buggy, not to mention excruciatingly annoying. Also, a couple months ago all of the address book entries that were stored on my phone got deleted. I have no idea what could have caused this, but it apparently is another common problem with this model. The supplied ringtones that Samsung offers on this phone are nothing short of pathetic. It seems every ringtone that was programmed into this phone was meant for teeny boppers or little kids. There are no standard ringers on this phone and because of this I had my phone on vibrate all the time when I was out and about. However, if the ringtones are your cup of tea you cannot assign them to individual contacts. The only way you can do this is if you make your contact part of a group in your phonebook. Why Samsung would make it so that you can assign ringtones to groups, and not individual address book entries, is a mystery. When you close up the phone to end a call, the phone still stays on the line for well over a second. This means that if somebody were to say, ""wait, I forgot to tell you something"" it leaves them with the impression that you just hung up on them. This was a very disappointing offering by Samsung, and I'm quite surprised that they haven't issued a recall of this model due to its host of defects, and I'm equally surprised that T-Mobile continues to sell this phone with their service. You would be better suited with another model.",negative

"I've had this phone for going on 4 days now. I've pretty much made up my made to take it back and exchange for something different. Don't get me wrong, this is a nice phone. It seems to be pretty durable, except for the flimsy cover that is on the charging port - it will break off, I'm 100% sure of that. It's a nice looking phone...I held it up to the Samsung Sync and in my opinion it looks better then that due to the Sync looks like a toy due to the plastic. For the price, the phone has a ton of features! I'm not going to go and list pro's/con's but I will touch base on why I am not satisfied with this phone. Since these features or non features are not listed when you go into the store. Why I am returning: - The ring is ascending ONLY! There is no way to fix this...by the time its loud enough for me to hear it, the caller has hung up (VERY annoying) - Ring tones are horrible - You cannot customize your contacts. Meaning no assignable ring tones or photo ID. - Every time you go to write a text message, and you have to stop or start over, it saves to draft. - A very annoying alert tone every time you access something from a menu. For instance, take a picture and then go to options to delete or send - you get an annoying chime. So if any of these issues are important for you to have on a phone, then don't buy this one. If they don't really matter then check it out cause you will probably enjoy this phone.",negative

The cons - the sound quality was unacceptable... On my side, the sound was ""tinny"" at best, the volume settings were either too quiet or too loud. I could have lived with that... The real issue was the sound quality at the other end. People were telling me that my voice sounded very muffled. I figured that the ""Noise Assassin"" (what a cool name by the way) was the culprit. I disabled the noise assassin, and it got a little better (less muffled), but was still unacceptable to others that I called. So it went back, and I'm back to my wired headset that sounds better... I hope this helps others.",negative
"The first one I bought lasted 3 months before the clip broke (cheaply made), the rubber piece that surrounds the headphone would not stay on, and then the audio stopped working altogether. I then purchased a 2nd one (hoping for a different result)... On the 2nd one, the clip also broke and the rubber piece came off the headphone as well. I ended up buying a new phone partly because of the poor quality of this headset and the fact that there wern't any others that seemed any better for this size of headphone jack.",negative
"I purchased the Motorola Razr in February of this year. It was a replacement for the one my husband had for years. This new phone works just like the old one and is very reliable with a long battery life and is very convenient to carry. We were dismayed when we realized that the Razr is no longer available through TMobile, but delighted when we found it on Amazon.com. The purchase was very easy and the phone arrived very quickly.",positive
It does work as a charger and but when I try to use it power an FM transmitter connected to an iPod or phone as a music player it causes so much RF interference that the car radio is not able to pick up any stations clearly. This was the primary reason I bought this device and I am disappointed.,negative
Cancels out noise but I wish it was louder & would reconect to the phone quicker & as easy as other Plantronics did. The stereo part works great!,positive

"I had a NON extended Samsung battery for nearly three years and needed to replace it. Well I purchased the EXTENDED version of this battery fully believing it would work great. Well I was VERY surprised to find out that it actually gave me LESS talk time then my 3 year old NON EXTENDED battery. It could not even hold a charge for one day. When I contacted the company for a refund they REFUSED to accept the return because I did not keep the original packaging which is crazy because it is a battery and who would expect a battery not to work? But WAIT, it gets WORSE!! When I posted a negative feedback, they contacted me and asked me to remove it and they would give me a refund. I removed it and they NEVER gave me the refund. So NOT only does this company produce DEFECTIVE products they lie and don't honor their word. They deserved to be removed from Amazon. I have contacted their security department and they are conducting a full investigation. In the meantime. DO NOT purchase ANYTHING from this vendor. They are EVIL and will likely soon be banned from Amazon.",negative

"The sound quality from this unit is better than any other that I have tried and, I guess, that is the most important thing. That being said, it IS heavy and, worst of all, it does not fit worth a damn. It takes me a minute or so of two handed wrestling (so much for the safe-to-use-while-driving theory) to get it on and, when it is, it is not at all secure. You have to hold your head sort of like you would if you had a book balanced on top. Too sudden of a move and it will flap around and/or fall off. I even tried taking some of the excellent gells that came with my wired jabra unit and forcing them on to this one. I did some surgery on one with an exacto knife, but it was no go. All in all, when my phone rings while I am driving, I usually look over at the jabra (where it has fallen onto the passenger seat), sigh, and reach for my headset. Probably will end up on ebay.",neutral
The armband is a bit snug on the phone but for the price you really can't complain about that. I enjoyed the armband while it lasted. I went running today and the stitching completely popped off the side of the armband. I tried to do some makeshift patchwork to at least extend the life of the armband a bit more but that was unsuccessful because the armband stitching quickly broke again.,neutral

"The Geko 201 is a great GPS. I've had it for almost a year and never had any complaints. Sure, it doesn't come with mapping features, altimeter, etc. But if you are only going to use it for light hiking and geocaching, this is the best in the market. It's lightweight and compact and can take quite a few knocks! I've dropped it on rocks and into the water a few times and it still managed to survive with just a few scratches. Like other GPS units, it doesn't work very well if you are walking in an area closed in by trees or buildings.",positive

The Prismiq Media Player does not live up to its promise.

Sadly, the unit does not appear to be defective. After a few calls & emails to Prismiq's rather sub-par tech support, I have given up.

"I'd have to start by saying the customer service for the product is wonderful. They were able to clarify installation directions (base unit and exterior antannae have to be 15 VERTICAL FEET apart, not just 15 feet apart). Unfortunately we don't get a consistent enough signal to gauge if the product works. Once we got everything installed we had full signal but it would bounce around from Analog to Digital Roam to something else. Each time it would change (5-15 seconds), all signal would drop completely. Even when the signal held we couldn't receive or make calls. We are really disappointed. Our land line is ancient and not a day goes by when it works the whole day through. We were hoping this product would allow us to drop our land line and be completely cellular.",neutral

Just like any other phone there are problems. The area I live in causes me to lose signal when bad weather roles in. I lose it just like my home phone. It has annoying ring tones which I download new ones weekly just so I can find the thing. The disco lights are blinking reminders of how much my service plan is a month. Too much.. Though I never go over the minutes it is all the taxes that get to me. I radio works wonders. I never thought it could be so useful especially when I see so many rednecks on four-wheelers using them. I can actually think of at least 10+ people locally that I call when my service is down. We have our own network and the same phones. Nextel does not reconize a outage unless 6 people have report it. Our small town becomes total choas when our radios do not work. Overall.. This is just another cell phone and it does not float per Buddy who went fishing with it. It is something to be handle with care. The buttons are small and the graphics are great. The ring tones and beeps are just getting worse. I suggest you go and look at one before purchasing it.,neutral

"Great product and it actually rescued us. Our Rand McNalley RV gps 12-volt power connector broke and we were without gps on a long trip.

"UPDATE: i was able to connect this device only to the Sony ericcson phone and this device has failed to connect to any other phone after that. I have tried multiple brands of phones like Nokia, LG etc but none of them seem to connect to this device even though the phones seem to support this device. So, this was a complete waste of my money. I have not used this device in 2 years because of this issue. Infact i have a similar problem with my other Jabra Bluetooth headset. It connected to my Nokia E71 and refuses to connect to any other device! DO NOT BUY THIS DEVICE OR ANY JABRA DEVICE! the moment i saw this, i was floored and the reviews were very good ..i have purchased this product and have been using this for about 2 months now. So far, no problems at all. I purchased this device so that i can easily listen to songs in the gym from my cell phone instead of carrying my ol mp3 player also. it can easily connect with most modern bluetooth enabled phones without any issues. Though I was UNABLE to connect to my samsung phone, i know that it was my phone's problem rather than the gadget. Samsung phones block one of the ports for bluetooth which enables the bluetooth phone to connect to devices (Samsung claims that this is done to prevent viruses from using this port to access the phone and destroying it. No other phone company does this to their phones!). I was able to seamlessly connect this device to my other sony Ericsson phone almost instantaneously. So, if you guys have a Samsung mobile phone, then don't waste your money on this gadget or for that matter any blue tooth gadget. The only gadgets samsung allows are the blue tooth headsets (since they use a different port). But this Jabra device is a breeze to setup and use. I can change tracks using the buttons on the device and this device does everything that the manufacturers claim... one thing you might want to consider is that this device is not really good if you want to use it in the gym while you are running on the treadmill/ or on the track since the gadget keeps bouncing off your chest when you are running. Apart from the ergonomics, it is a very good device.",negative
"but there is a remedy. I drive a big truck (rig) and mounting the device above the visor-which wouldn't work at all-causes you to raise your voice to be heard.

I do not like sticking an ear unit in my ear(have several),always feels like they're falling out. The cure. I mounted a piece of velcro on the steering wheel. Yep,sure did. Doesn't interfere with the steeringat all. Then too I only do that when I'm on the ,""big road"",to avoid any complications. Would I buy the unit again?Yes.

"This is my first bluetooth. I did quite a bit of research, as I usually do. I have mixed feelings about the product. I seriously considered returning it because one friend and my daughter said I sounded like I was in a bathroom or a tunnel. My brother had a whole conversation with me and couldn't tell I was on an earpiece. I tried to test it myself to see what the sound quality was like by leaving myself voicemail messages on another phone line with it, and it sounded normal. I kept it because it serves it's function. It's also cute and matches my red Blackberry curve 8330 perfect...almost like the two were made to go together! As far as the advanced functions, I would definitely not recommend buying the product simply for those. I've tried using a few of the advanced functions. There are many different capabilities, apparantly, but each requires the user to press the same button, for for a different amount of time depending on the function. (press 1 second for this function, press 6 seconds for this function...ect) That part seems a little complicated for me, but might be easier for the pro's out there. Bottom line: It works.",neutral

"Bought it for my Samsung Galaxy S II for AT&T. The phone has a micro USB port, so you need a micro USB plug to charge it. The a97 is iGO's attempt at a micro USB phone charging plug but they failed IMO. The unit shipped to me was in a small plastic bag shipped in a padded envelope. When I opened the package it was scuffed from the shipping process. This is minor and it doesn't bother me too much. However the fact that the a97 plug that I received will not stay securely in the USB port does bother me. The a97 plug fits in the phone and the phone will charge, but you have to put something up against the cable to make it stay inside the phone. I am fine with having to jerry-rig a charging cable after months of constant service. I am not fine with having to jerry-rig right out of the padded envelope... I bought this tip for $6.40 because it was half off what the local RadioShack was selling it for and it was being sold by iGO themselves via Amazon. Normally I am always satisfied with my Amazon purchases, but this time I had to learn a little $6.40 lesson. FYI: I am thinking these might be ""factory second"" tips from iGO (hence the half off price from the iGO themselves) or mine got severely bashed (more than is externally visible) during shipping Being frustrated I went ahead and bought another a97 tip from RadioShack and viola, the tips fits into the phone snugly and charges without problems... so far.",negative

I'm in outside sales and I use my headset mainly in the car while driving. Having a wireless headset is very important but the quality of sound sending and receiving is also very important.

Bought this item because it is suppose to be an official Samsung OEM product. Samsung Galaxy phones require at least a 1.0A charger else it discharges. This product works as sold but is made very cheaply and the cord is very short. I do not expect it to last very long. I have already migrated to another type vehicular charger which has dual USB receptacles and is rated at 2.0A. More times than not I need to charge two phones in the car at once. The added benefit of USB is that it allows me to standardize and use the cable in the car or house.,neutral
I have tried 6 different bluetooth headsets and the one thing I hate about all of them is they are not loud enough. I always find myself pressing the headset against me ear to hear so I end up not using them because I can just put my phone up against my ear. This headset goes into your ear like an earbud and is louder than I need. I actually have to turn this one down a little bit. Beware of fake clone models from Hong Kong. There are several websites that help you find the difference between them. Even some Sprint stores were selling these. If you get one of those you will be disappointed. The easiest way to tell if you have one of them is if the LED doesn't change to blue after the charge is complete.,positive

"I like this phone, it has a nice feel, there is a learning curve with the touch screen querty keyboard, but it is a quick learn. The menus are well laid out and easy to navigate. The ringer could be louder, but the call quality is very nice, and very loud as well. I had two of these phones and I had to send them both back. No matter how long I left these on the charger, they would never indicate that the battery was fully charged. I could leave it on the charger for 2 days and it would never say charge complete. So, I sent them back and ordered the Motorola Karma. All in all, if you can get a phone without that problem with the charging circuit, it is a nice phone. I wish LG would get their act together in the Quality Control department. Since I have encountered this, I have found that this is a fairly frequent happening, and has been going on almost since the phone was first introduced. Amazon.com's service was great in taking care of the defective phones.",negative
"I ordered this one thinking it would allow me to charge multiple device at the same time. I guess I didn't pay close attention the the description and just assumed.

"Only been using it for a day or two. First thoughts is it is smaller physically than the Zero Lemon version but rated higher mah. Nice that it doesn't block the speaker. Nice case. I don't understand the reasons for the critical reviews, I have used extended batteries for years mostly the zero lemon, this battery is definitely an upgrade to the oem. My s5 wouldn't get through a whole day of phone calls, Pandora, email, Facebook, and maybe a little Hulu streaming. With ANY extended battery I have owned I can do all these things and still have 30% or more battery life at the end of the day. Sometimes even go for 2 days! Now if I don't do all those things and I'm in a good service area then the battery will last 3 days. If you really don't notice any improvement over your OEM battery then either you got a lemon or something else is going on. Wouldn't be surprised if the Zero lemon guys are leaving bad reviews because Powerbear's 2 year warranty is far beyond their 180 days.

Very disappointing. I had high hopes that this speaker would be far superior to the Jabra I was using. It's not.

I have a Samsung Galaxy 5 smart phone so there shouldn't be any compatibility issues. Guess I have to keep looking for a better car speaker option.,negative
"I did not get reliable cell phone service with this amplifier, for any arrangement of the antennas. I also tried the zBoost PCS amplifier without luck and eventually settled on a Wilson SOHO amplifier system with Yagi PCS antenna which works well. The only reason I give this two stars rather than 1 star is that my case may be more challenging than most because my home signal is weak but there is a strong roaming signal at my house. This amplifier would frequently get the error condition of oscillation caused by having the indoor and outdoor antennas too close together, even when I had them much farther apart than the minimum recommended distance.",negative

When I lost the charger than went together with my KRZR I couldn't even think what a huge problem it was. My phone has a mini-USB port and I knew that my husband charged his old Motorola from ANY computer with a mini-USB cable. I tried to use that cable but couldn't charge it and kept getting error messages. I thought it was a faulty device but looked over the internet and found that Motorola PURPOSELY made their cell phones incompatible with normal USB cables to cause a lot of problems with their customers. I was not able to use my cell phone for several days which was especially upsetting during a trip. One of the reasons I liked Motorolas was that they could charge from any computer's USB port. Now I see I was wrong and my next phone won't be Motorola.,neutral

"I have been using the parrot minikit for over a month now. As stated in other reviews the instruction manual is absolutely awful. Since this unit doesn't have a digital display, it is important that the user understand the menu hierarchy. However, the instructions do not provide anything that resembles a diagram that may guide the user in programming the unit. Eventually, after much stumble, lurch and fall - I was able to to adjust all of the settings. Aside from this- the unit works well with my Sprint Razr. It read my contacts with minimum fuzz. I was not able to enter the keywords for my contacts but it pronounces the names entered in the contacts. The pronunciation is not clear and it takes some getting used to understanding the contacts' names. At this point, I feel that I got my money's worth",neutral
"This is an absolute must-have for anyone with an LCD-display phone. It's true, though, that it does take some care, finesse, good light, and fingernails to apply the protective shield to the screen. Mine came with a set of two (inner & outer displays), and a small swatch of pink microfiber cloth for cleaning the screens. The protective shields are themselves covered on both sides by a clear plastic film that must be removed. There is a label on each side telling you in what order they should be removed and how to install the shield. You do have to flick up the invisible edge of the film with your fingernail before you can pull it off. The inner surface of the shield is adhesive, but it can be removed and repositioned. It isn't as easy as it sounds to get it positioned perfectly, and I found that I couldn't completely get every bubble pressed out. However, once I put my case back on the outside of the phone and turned it on, I couldn't see the bubbles at all. For something so thin, it's amazingly sturdy. It also seems impervious to fingerprints, and the display is just as clear and bright with it on. The little cleaning cloth should also be handy for glasses and camera lenses. The problem one reviewer had with the shield touching the keypad must be particular to that phone. It doesn't seem to be doing that on mine.",positive

"Cons: Sluggish. Hangs every now and then. Video (movies) does not play for more than 10-15 min after that the sound comes but the screen freeze. Even after Xenon flash indoor shoots are hazy. The hands free is weird, it has a button to disconnect but it does not redial the last number. Also the disconnect button location inadvertently disconnects the call in the middle of conversation. Pros: Almost everything in a phone. GPS works fine, only time to first connect is long but after that it quickly links and works fine. WLAN connects faster. Camera for all cell phone standard is extremely good, I used it on a trip and I am happy with the results. Speakers are good quality Overall I would recommend this phone but keep in mind that it won't do things as fast as you would like it to perform. Forget about watching video as they play only for 10-15 min.

"After owning this headset for the last six months, I am rather disappointed. I should have watched the video reviews before I bought the item.

Also, the noise reduction does not work so well -- if the car you are driving experiences moderate road noise, the microphone will pick it up.

"I have used just about every major brand Bluetooth headsets. Comparatively, this headset stands somewhere in the middle of the crowd. Pros: 1) Light weight and comfortable to wear. I love the soft gel type ear-tip. I wear it whole day for close to 12 hours and can honestly say that at times I don't even realize that I am wearing a Bluetooth headset. (However, this ""light weight"" leads in to a short-coming as we shall see later). 2) Easy to charge unlike my other Plantronics Discovery/Explorer headsets (that I have purchased over the last 2 years to last 2 months range). Plantronics headset button-type charger mechanism is very fragile. Gentle touch is sufficient enough to stop these headsets from charging and requires some ""playing around"" to get charging process going again. However, this BlackBerry HS-655+ uses a mini-USB, type B connector. As a result, charger plug establishes a solid, reliable connection, that is not prone to such contact problems. Once you connect charger cable to the charging cradle, just insert your headset properly and forget about it. Contact problems are virtually non-existent in this headset/cradle combination. 3) Stylish, matches my Blackberry. 4) Sound quality is extremely good on both ends (though doesn't even come close to my Jabra BT5010 or Nokia Bluetooth headsets). 5) Volume level is loud enough for most occasions and purposes. 6) If your phone supports it, you will get notifications of incoming emails, text messages etc. via this Bluetooth headset, when paired successfully with your phone. 7) Pairing was a snap. It successfully pairs with my 2 phones (Samsung and BlackBerry) every time. 8) Quick connect and disconnect (unlike my Motorola and Jabra bluetooth headsets). 9) Supports call mute, last number redial and voice dial feature. However, voice dial feature never worked with my phones. (Jabra BT5010 works like a charm when it comes to voice dial). 10) Easy to carry around with charging cradle that doubles as a shirt clip-on carry case for this headset. Cons: 1) Dismal battery life. Battery needs to be charged every day, invariably. Even with modest use (say 80-100 minutes talk time everyday and rest in standby mode), you will end up charging it every day. 2) Voice dial feature may/may not work. 3) Power/Call connect/Disconnect button is somewhat hard to press, especially when you are wearing this headset. 4) In order to change the Right ear to Left ear configuration (or vice versa), you have to physically remove the soft gel ear tip, then remove the ear hook, then install them accordingly in the reverse order. Little tedious, not a big deal, but I guess I got used to Plantronics Discovery headsets (swiveling pivot type mechanism), where this interchange is addressed smoothly. Overall, it is a mixed bag when you own this headset. However, if you are getting it for (almost) free after MIR, you won't be sorry with your purchase.",neutral
I'm not totally sure if these work or not. I applied one to the battery as the instructions said. I also applied one to the inside of the protective case on my phone. The signal is so bad here that I couldn't really tell if it helped or not. I like to think it did but wouldn't swear to it. Figure it can't hurt and for the price it was worth a try.,neutral
"Some of the negative reviews gave me pause, but I went ahead when Amazon put this one in the ""Gold Box"" program at $32.99. It worked great out of the box, paired easily with my Blackberry Curve, and after a few days I hardly knew it was there, even though I have never worn one of these things before. I was worried that it was kind of big and would interfere with my glasses, but once I get it on my ear, it stays put and doesn't give me any problems. I hear occassional static if phone is in the pocket on the other side of my body from the ear I am using, so I just swap pockets. Good product, if just a little ugly. I have no complaints.",positive

"I recently moved to Phoenix, Arizona, and thought it a good time to get a new mobile phone. A friend recommended Nextel, saying we'd use the direct connect function. Cool. So I ordered an i730 from Amazon. After charging and activating and waiting the required day, I called to get my phone number. It was a Palo Alto, CA, number!? That's over 700 miles away! An 11 hour drive to the next state. No way close to a local number. Nextel did not seem to understand or care. ""It's the closest we have."" ""There are no 602 area code phone numbers left."" I begged for maybe a 480 number or anything that is a local call from here in Phoenix. Nothing doing. After a few more days and a few more calls to Nextel that went nowhere, I called Sprint (who have not been customer service stars to me in the past) and within four minutes had a local 602 Phoenix number working on my current Sprint phone. I canceled the Nextel service. They are charging me $35 (expected) plus $11.53 in taxes, fees and assessments ""we can't change"" for a couple of days when all I called was customer service. If you buy the phone, I hope Nextel has a local area code for you, because if they don't you are stuck for $46.53 and an Amazon return. It was a pretty color screen though . . .",negative
"This product was not designed by engineers with Cell Phone experience. HP is a big name in PDAs but they are not on the map in cell phones - this product demonstrates this. Don't order steak at a seafood restaurant.

Then i can use again for about 2 hours. I am using this with a Blackberry 9700. sound quality is, i don't want to say adequate, its better then that but its not stellar either. It is only 60 bucks.,you get what you pay for. the initial pairing was fairly painless. daily re-pairing is a pain. it will call the last person i dialed 3 or 4 times before i can get it synced up. i will admit i held the manual in my hands long enough to pull it out of the shipping package and throw it away. a bluetooth is a a bluetooth they all sync and function generally the same. the phone call is user error, I'm sure. I don't recall the ad for this unit saying it would place calls and that is why i wanted it. not a deal breaker but i do accidentally call people a lot. the 2 hour limit and it beeps is annoying. i work 8-9 hour days. this was bought so i can leave my phone plugged in and charging as i move around the office.

I have been using bluetooth on my cell phones for nearly 6 years. I have tried and thrown out or lost at least 10 bluetooth headsets in the past 6 years. I am very happy to say that the Cardo Scala 700 is one I will try to hang on to. It has several capabilities that are critical to me: 1-Great listening volume 2-Very good voice quality for the people I speak with. 3-Excellent battery life 4-Very easy to use. 5-Very comfortable. I use by blackberry 8700C and bluetooth headset as my primary office phone. I am on it 12- to 16 hours a day. The Scala 700 is the best blue toothheadset I have used to date.

"I had the IMP500 and have now upgraded to the IMP52D. This is a superior product and very reliable. I like the size and shape, though it's still a bit heavy but worth toting it around when I need the power. I like that the micro usb is now the female option to charge the IMP52D. I to tend to use my OEM Motorola cable which has a better fit to my phone. The LED and Laser lights are 'nice to have' and while I honestly don't use them, I suppose they may come in handy at sometime in the future. It might be nice to have a separate button to trigger the lights vs. the battery power so you don't have to cycle through and press/hold to get a light if that's what is needed. Mainly what is great about the IMP52D is the amount of charge/power you get to your device. It's tiny but mighty! Which makes it the ideal commuter or travel accessory.

"I replaced a high-end previous generation nokia with this phone based primarily on its small size. The good: *Size. This phone fits easily in my pocket. I had a tiny nokia and this phone was the only flip phone at the Cingular store that was nearly as narrow. *Signal. I find the signal coverage to be slightly better on this phone than my nokia (despite cingular's advice to the contrary). *Battery life. I go a few days between charges. The phone seems to charge quickly, too. *Usability. I thought it would take time to get used to something other than my nokia but the menus were easy to use. The OK: *Camera. The camera is not great in low light, but is fine overall. One annoyance is the camera can be turned on using an external button. I've taken the occasional picture of my pocket. Also, you can't seem to get rid of the camera's shutter sound (I haven't looked that hard, but it wasn't obvious). *Sound quality. I think sound quality is lower on this phone than on my old nokia. I can hear people fine, but there is a little bit of distortion, like you might hear if you turned your stereo up too loud. It seems to help to keep the volume down a little and/or to tilt the phone slightly away from my ear. Like most phones there are volume buttons on the side of the phone so its easy to adjust. *Customization. I don't feel like I have as much control over ringing patterns, displays, etc. as I did on my nokia. Still, those are the kinds of things you get used to. The bad: There are really no deal-breakers for me on this phone. So far its been a good deal. Overall a very capable phone. I'm enjoying it.",positive

The sound is clear, the system is easy to use and definetely beats talking with the phone in your ear.

"I have practiced with my M-14 basket a few times now and I really like it. It's incredibly easy to set up and take down. I recently took it on a trip and the whole thing locks together nicely for transport. It probably takes about a minute to set up and close to that to take back down. I agree with the other reviewers on the number of chains. I'm not a delicate putter so I have sent quite a few disks through the chains that would have ended up in a normal basket. It just makes me try harder to hit the center post when I'm putting. Don't expect the chains to be your friend. For me, I actually like this in a practice basket because I have to aim better. When I get back out on a course, I'm sure it's going to end up helping me. One thing that surprised me for a ""portable"" basket was that there isn't a handle on the box. Other boxes that are supposed to be re-used, like my artificial Christmas tree, have handles on the box that help keep the box closed and make it easier to move it around. This basket is light enough that one handle on the box would make it so much easier to haul around. I should be able to carry my disk bag in one hand and the basket in the other hand. It's a minor thing, I know, but it really should be part of the portability factor for this basket.",positive
"Appearance/Design: Overall a great design for the device. Nice miniature size that fits into my backpack's smallest compartments or even snugly into my jacket or jeans pockets if necessary. Black surface with metal, beveled edges makes for a premium quality feel, and its weight gives it a nice sturdiness. Features: The flashlight is nice, it projects light at a reasonable distance and illuminates objects nicely. The laser pointer features is an awesome addition, perfect for helping with a presentation or just having fun. It also sits nicely and feels ergonomic for my grip, which makes it great for presentations. Charging: It took about 2 hours for the charger to charge up my Galaxy SIII from 20% to 90% (at that point the charger lost about half of its storage). In another test, my Galaxy SIII charged from 24% to 85% in a little under 2 hours. This is fast enough for my uses. I'm not sure if the 4 blue LEDs are enough to show the energy stored in the charger--it would be nice if there were 6 or even 8 LEDs to indicate capacity levels. 5200 mAh is definitely enough for my daily usage.",positive

Don't get me wrong, this matte black phone is slim and sexy and lightweight fun and easy to slip into a pocket. But those are it's biggest draws. Some other cons include: -The large square screen and key pad get dirty easily from holding the phone up to your face. I don't wear make-up, but if I did, I can imagine that I'd always be taking a toothpick to all of those little crevices between the keys on the flat keypad all the time. As it is now, I'm constantly wiping the screen and keys. -The battery life is not long and if you're going anywhere overnight, remember to bring your charger. -The operating system is the same as other newer model Motorola phones, so don't expect a big upgrade there either. If Cingular is your provider, the sim card from your current phone will work in this unlocked version nicely. However, make sure you've saved all of your numbers and info on the card and not on the old phone before you take the sim card out of the old phone, because it doesn't slip into this phone very easily. Once it's in, it is difficult to remove. If you have some extra money to spend on a new phone and you don't mind the same reception problems as cheaper phones, then this is the phone for you.",neutral

"I only gave this 3 stars because of the fact that I had to purchase a ""dumb"" charger to go along with this $90 charger. Little by little I kept getting the error message on my batteries until nearly all of them were useless. Thankfully the person who commented on JL's review was able to explain why. When the batteries are too depleted, you'll get an error message, stick them in a cheapo charger for 10 minutes and it fixes the problem. I had to spend an extra $20 to buy a ""dumb"" charger because I needed one that would charge every size. Sooo...while it does a fine job of recharging batteries that are not completely depleted (which is a pain to monitor), I expect more out of a $90 charger.",neutral
"I didn't know much about GPS systems when I decided to buy this unit (my husband is the electronic guru in my house). I only knew I was sick of printing up mapquest directions when I needed to go somewhere as I got lost easily. I needed something simple to use that I could use in the car to navigate where I was to go. This Garmin 200 is perfect! The best and most easy to use basic GPS unit out there. If you're looking for something that is easy to use, this is it! It's basic, meaning that it doesn't have all the bells and whistles of the more pricey versions (no bluetooth, doesn't say street names, no text to speech, no FM option) but don't let that discourage you at all! It does the job JUST AS WELL as the expensive versions without all the junk you won't use. The only thing I would have liked more was if it said street names, but it's not necessary. It talks to me and tells me when I need to turn and I can visibly see the street name on the screen well enough. I have very few cons... my personal preferences really, but here they are: 1) only one voice, female. 2) No case. You have to buy one seperatly if you plan on not getting this dinged up in your purse/bag. 3) No A/C adaptor. Again, you must buy this seperate. Overall I gave this 5 stars because it was ready to use after I charged it, easy to figure out and most importantly... gets me to where I need to go. I live in a RURAL area of OK and it has back roads on the map I didn't even know about! You won't be disappointed! I am a wife and mother of 3... this is perfect and user friendly for all elctronic weary women like myself. I can't even put a baby crib together with instructions in front of me but I was able to install this and use it in no time at all!",positive

"After using this phone for about a week, I have come to the conclusion that the engineers spent 100 hours making it a great and pretty PDA, but about 10 minutes making the phone user friendly. The good: 1. Looks very slick, trendy, and futuristic. The keyboard rolling out is definitely a convo starter and gets people's attention. 2. You can either tap the screen with your finger or use the stylus. 3. Came with stereo earpiece. This also allows you to upload your MP3's and listen to them without purchasing any extra equipment. 4. When you connect your phone to your computer through USB, it charges the battery. The BAD: 1. You turn off your phone's ringer to go to sleep. You try and set the alarm for 8 am. The phone warns you: ""The Alarm will not be audible with the phone on silent. Do you wish to continue""? Why yes, because a soundless alarm will do wonders to wake me up. EDIT: I have gotten around this issue by installing ""AlarmToday."" This app has many great features, but the best is the Calendar's Reminder (not Alarm) ability to ""overwrite"" system sound. This way, you can have a Reminder go off even when the phone is on silent. 2. You are entering a new contact's information; first of all you have to scroll to the 10th field to even get to the mobile number field. Then when you start typing, the phone is not smart enough to recognize that instead of typing ""R"" it should be typing 4. You can't have letters in a phone number, hello!? 3. The amount of ringtones, and the quality of ringtones would rate a 2/5. hey are very short, annoying, and not catchy. 4. Pulling out the keyboard SHOULD automaticaly get it to light up, so you can see it at night, but it doesn't. You then have to blindly press a key, not knowing the consequences. 5. Battery life is very short. Barely 2 day's worth of usage. 6. The camera sucks. Oh my g-d, does it suck. The pictures taken indoors are blurry, grainy, and you will be deleting most of them. I work in Quality Assurance, and there is NO WAY, I would have let this phone ship. Especially considering some of the other issues people are having below.

"I've been using Plantronics Voyager 510 for the last 2 months and I couldn't be happier. When I was about to give up on the whole Not-Yet-Ready-For-The-Prime-Time-Bluetooth-Concept here comes along that little gem. Everything I hated in each and every other model just done right here. Granted, it looks weird when you look at it for the first time, in Seinfeldish kinda This Is A Complete Opposite Of Every Bluetooth Headset You Has Ever Had. How in the name will that thick ear loop fit right? But if you think about it placing heavier part of the device BEHIND your ear will ensure that it will stay put no matter what you do all day long. This is a truly comfortable construction and the first one for me that I can wear for as long as I want without fearing for my big and floppy ears to fall off. My second biggest gripe for other models is the static. Gosh it was driving me nuts to talk and listen and ask again and again thru all of the crackling and whooshing. Plantronics Voyager 510 has ZERO static, end of story. Even outside with the wind and street noise you can hear perfectly well the other party and what you tell them. Another big frustration I've came across with other headsets is when it disconnects from your phone by itself when on standby. It just doesn't happen with Voyager 510. It stays connected for all day long securely waiting for that important phone call when your hands are full with something else. And then there is a battery life. I charge it once a week just because I get tired of waiting for that tiny red light to start blinking. Granted, I don't talk THAT much, but still it's a huge advantage over the competition. Of course it has its oddities. Placement of buttons a little unorthodox to say the least. They all are very stiff especially Power button. But that's about it. This little guy is as close to my perfect Bluetooth headset as it can be. Way to go Plantronics! Pros: * Loud and clear both ways, no static! * Good fit * No disconnections with the phone on standby * Good range, pairs easily with the phone or Bluetooth dongle for PC * Used with Skype gives you cordless phone quality and convenience to move around * Excellent battery life Cons: * Buttons are stiff, Power button most of them all * No easy way to switch on the fly from one paired device to the other",positive
"Sprint is great, but this phone is not. I bought it for my wife since it matched the UI on her old ATT nokia. She HATES this phone for three reasons: 1. My wife needs to charge it every night, whether she has used it or not. Sprint says this is normal because it has a small battery. 2. The buttons are impossible to use when you are driving since they flow together. 3. When you go to unlock the phone the screen doesn't light up If Nokia came out with a battery that lasted twice as long - even if the phone ended up bigger - we could deal with it. As it is I have been directed by ""she who must be obeyed"" to get her the new Treo when it ships, or any other sprint phone except this piece of junk.",negative

"Delivery of this product took only three days. Prior to using this cellular signal booster in my home my Cingular serviced cell phone showed only two bars, my other Sprint serviced cell phone was the same. The signals were lost in different parts of the house. This is not a huge house. With this YX510 dual band booster I can get four bars in most areas of my home and two to three on the porches. However, depending on where I place the indoor antenna I get stronger or weaker signals in various portions of the house. You definitely want to try different rooms and locations within those rooms to find your best location. I will purchase another 20 to 30 feet of cable to allow me more maneuvering ability with the unit. The outside antenna is best placed on the outside of the house. I tried it near a window without much signal improvement, then in the attic with more signal improvement. But the best placement was outside on the roof. All in all, I am glad to have this unit since the cell phone signals at my house are strong and reliable enough to replace a land line telephone.",positive

The new base unit was about the same price as 2 extra handsets (if you could find them). So I'm one happy camper now, 2 handsets weren't enough to cover the whole house.

"At least I got all the pieces to this one, as the last one I got was missing the antenna and I had to ship it back. I set this up in my office, and got the green LED, acknowledging the unit was powered up. Put my LG G4 in the cradle and saw no change in the reception bars. Pulled up the dB meter in the phone setting and after several rounds of testing determined that the booster was having no effect at all , a 0dB gain in signal strength under any conditions. Just to make sure the booster was defective, I brought in an older Wilson Electronics Sleek that I have been using successfully in my home for a few years now. I used the weBoost antenna with the older cradle and it worked great, 8-12dB of gain without even fussing with it. I also noted that this thing got very warm, almost hot. My older Wilson Electronics Sleek has never been anything but room temperature . I was already a bit leery when I saw the company had changed its name, as this rarely if ever spells an improved product from any entity.

"Yes, this phone is sleek. The buttons are hardly raised, and the ports on either side (for charger/earpiece and memory card, respectively) are covered by thin strips of plastic held on by some sort of elastic material. If you carefully look at these, however, they seem easily broken! Be careful lest you snap them off. Other reviewers have raved about the form factor, but personally I find this phone TOO slim! I feel I can't get a good grip on it while I'm holding it next to my ear, and I am quite afraid I'll drop it into one of the sewer or subway grates that pepper the sidewalks of New York - or worse, an elevator shaft! (A friend of mine did this with a flip phone!) Suggestions to buy a protective case should not be taken lightly. Battery life: I pulled the new phone out of the box, charged it fully, then used it normally (about 10 calls a day, some Music Player usage, Bluetooth on for 1/2 hour, mostly standby). I got a low battery warning less than 60 hours later. It died in another 12 hours of standby. Not very impressive at all, although it might take a couple of cycles of full charges and discharges to reach normalcy. Update: After a week of full charge/discharge cycles, the battery life has not improved at all. With normal usage, I get at most 72 hours out of a discharge. I can imagine someone using this phone to make more phone calls would experience an even shorter battery life. Thumbs down! Mac users beware! YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SYNC YOUR CONTACTS OR CALENDAR ITEMS. Just because it has ""Bluetooth"" does not mean it's compatible with iSync. As of this writing, no Samsung phone is compatible with iSync. This is due to Samsung's refusal to support the open-source transfer standard iSync uses (instead of a proprietary one), and not Apple's fault. OS X's built-in file transfer app will function just fine, but the phone does not give you access to the all-important contacts and organizer files, so tricks that work on other Samsung phones (like vCard splitting your Address Book items and transferring to the phone manually) DO NOT WORK ON THE T519. Be prepared to spend several hours importing your phonebook manually, or try saving to your SIM card from your old phone and retrieving contacts that way. Forget about using the organizer, it's trash, and mostly useless if you're used to the visual luxury of iCal to enter your appointments then syncing to your mobile. On the menu: although some essentials are truly buried (O alarm clock, where art thou? hint: menu-6-5-1), nearly every single menu item has a reference number! So, for example, by pressing Menu-9-5-1 you can quickly turn on or off Bluetooth from the main screen. This is similar to the old Nokia phones, whose easy-to-use interface I have long admired. The new-text-message and silent-mode features are also available at one click from the main screen (L and # keys). An annoyance: the dedicated T-Zones button on the main screen, although it's an issue with many T-Mobile exclusive phones, is still a user nightmare. It can't be changed to something more useful (in fact, no menu items can be changed), and clicking it loads the browser app, (which can take a few seconds to dismiss), taking you straightaway to T-Mobile's bill-gouging downloads center. Stupid. On the MP3 player: this seems like a late addition to the T519's software. It's feature-poor, and the phone itself gives you very few options for playback. Furthermore, you can use the phone for playback, but that's all it will do until you close the player app: messaging and playback, for instance, are mutually exclusive. And there's no headphone jack! Forget about plugging in your favorite Grado Labs or Sennheiser cans, you are forced to go with the included earpiece, meant for phone calls - and what a P.O.S. this thing is. It's one-eared (and thus, mono, obvs.), and the quality is terribly poor. Are you thinking of buying this phone for the player? Better you didn't. (Also, Samsung customer service could not name any compatible bluetooth headphones, and if you want more than a couple songs on the device, you need to purchase a memory card.) This is not to say it doesn't work well as a phone! But an iPod it's not. In sum, the T519 is a sleek little phone that should have been great but isn't. As with other Samsung phones, the presence of Bluetooth connectivity is misleading for Mac users, who are unable to use it with iSync. The Organizer and Music Player apps are feature-poor, but if you just want a phone, this is less of an issue. Menu complexity is not necessarily a problem if you take the time to learn numeric shortcuts for the things you use often, and a few oft-used items are one click away by default. To the reviewer who complained about the pink menu highlighting: this might be a T-Mobile branding issue rather than a gender-bias issue.",neutral

It has a camera, USB, is Bluetooth capable, an outer LCD display, and is able to download ringtones, games, pictures, and so on but essentially it's an older clamshell phone in a new case. So if you're looking for a new phone to upgrade to, I'd say this one isn't bad, but is in no way the best.",neutral
"The Palm Centro is my first PDA phone, although I have owned a couple other standalone PDA systems in the past. The Centro is not quite as convenient to use as a standalone PDA, but its small size and ""all-in-one"" concept make up for that. Overall, I would have to say that the value is excellent considering the low contract price (and price is important when you are a poor college student like I am), and I would recommend it for the most part. Pros: PDA with almost all functions I would want at a low cost Small size, can fit in most pants/jacket pockets easily Charges very quickly (to 80% within an hour) with original charger Palm OS synchronizes with PC Cons: Short battery life that runs out in middle of day with heavy usage Screen a little smaller than I would like Some people say that the keyboard keys look small, but I have had no problems whatsoever typing with it. It takes about one or two days to get used to. Not a problem at all. There are compromises for everything in life, including phones. The small screen and small battery come with the convenience of having a small unit. Obviously, you are going to get a smaller screen if you want the entire unit to be a convenient size. I solved the short battery life problem by buying an extra battery to get me through the day if the first one runs low. However, the pros greatly outweigh the cons for me, mainly because you get a real PDA (not some useless piece of junk like the BB or iPhone) that can sync with a PC. I can live with the slight inconveniences you get that make the phone a more practical product in general. In my opinion, this phone is better than the overpriced iPhone that can't even have synchronized documents, calendars, appointments, etc. with a PC. In the unfortunate event that my phone is lost/stolen, all my important information will still be backed up on the PC. That's what a REAL PDA phone does, not some cheaply made but well marketed phone that only seems better due to more attractive advertisements (BB or iPhone). I even bought a keyboard for this so that I could take notes in class with it without needing to bring my bulky laptop to class every day. I can just go back to my room, hit the hotsync button, and voila! I have the document on my laptop. Try doing that with an iPhone! (Sorry for the rant, but I believe people should do their own research and buy the better products instead of the more marketed ones) Conclusion: The Palm Centro is an excellent value as well as a highly versatile system. It has all the functions of the more expensive and desired phones, if not more. Unfortunately, Palm just does not seem to be as good at selling their products.",positive

"This is probably a good product, but the originating cell signal must be strong enough in the first place for it to work properly. In more remote areas, a different manufacturer, such as Wilson, may have a more powerful product that would work better. I found this product to be extremely easy to set up and operate, but the signal from the cell tower was not strong enough for this product to repeat satisfactory. They do have a 20 day money back guarantee, so if you find out you need a more powerful model, you are not stuck and can return it for something different. The people at WiEx were good to deal with. I cannot fault their product as my problem is with the signal from my cell tower and I am trying to get the WiEx product to do something it really isn't designed with enough power to do. It's worth a try and just return it if it doesn't work.",neutral

"I bought these headphones to use with my TV. I have some hearing loss and wanted to be able to listen with headphones while others listened to the speakers. While it will not work that way directly with my TV (plugging in the headphones turns of the TV speakers), I am able to do it using my stereo system. I have been using them for about 2 weeks now. The headphones are comfortable for about an hour and then I need to take them off for a few minutes. The sound quality is good and I really like being able to control the volume at the headset. I have also used them for music and find that I can not go more than about 20 feet from the source without it starting to cut out, but that is okay. They also seem to expereince brief interruptions if I turn my head so that it is between the tv and the volume control side of the headset. Minor annoyance. Overall, this is a pretty good set of wireless headphones. I am a bit worried about the durability of the plastic band. Other reviewers have talked about it breaking easily so I have been very careful with it. If it felt sturdier I think I would probably give them a 5.",positive
My first Bluetooth headset and I was a little disappointed. Pros: Good volume Easy to use Cons: 2-3 second delay when I speak (BIG CON) Echo - I can hear what I say after I say it Interesting is that it works better (less of a delay/echo)on my iphone than my blackberry BOLD. Seems the phone makes some difference.,neutral
I have no idea if the phone works. I think it is for europe because they sent a european plug end on the charger. I installed the sim card and cannot make calls with the phone.

Regardless it's a lot of extra time wasted to get a phone to work that was suppose to be ready to use.,negative
"The Motorola H700 headset is a decent piece of equipment, but I have a few issues with it still: 1) The battery is always dead! Why? Because of the fact that this device does not have any sort of neck lanyard (like the HS850), you have a tendancy to carry it in your pocket, purse, bag, etc. When you do this, it is very easy for the ""call button"" on the side to become slightly depressed. When this happens, the battery drains quickly. So, in order not to have your battery die, place the H700 in a location where NOTHING will touch it when not in use (i.e., when not on your head); 2) when answering a call on my Motorola V551 phone, if I try to transfer the call to my H700 headset after using the phone's handset, it doesn't work; the voice on the other end disappears--the H700 only works when I initiate a call with the headset on. This is extremely annoying, especially when driving in the car; 3) actual talk time is 5.5 hours, not 6 hours.",neutral

"I have a really really really flaky Verizon connection. I would drop calls all the time, even sometimes when standing in one of my special 'signal zones'. You know what I'm talking about. Anyway, I tried this thing out, and it would occasionally help my signal, but it just wasn't reliable. Maybe that's because my signal was so flaky to begin with. So I sent it back. And THEN I learned of the Verizon Wireless Network Extender. If you have Verizon and broadband internet, don't even think about this wireless booster. Just get the network extender. It's awesome, four solid bars throughout my whole house. If you have Sprint, they have a comparable product called the AIRAVE. Verizon's is $250 up front with no monthly fee. Sprint's is only $100 plus $5/month. Either way, I've heard you can sometimes talk them down if you threaten canceling your service. But even at full price, IT IS WORTH IT.",negative

"I bought this battery because the OEM one that came with the phone died completely. There's not much to say, it fit my phone perfectly and had enough juice to at least turn the phone on so I could see what calls I missed. Now that I've used if for a month or so though, I do feel like this battery drains faster than the OEM and that's kinda weird seeing as how this is a 1250mAh and the OEM one I had was 1150mAh. Overall though, I'm very pleased with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone looking to replace their phone's battery.",positive
"The technology on this product is fine; the speaker is good, the microphone picks up sound well, it pairs easily enough, etc. It's even super-small without sacrificing anything. However, the design and user interface of the WEP500 make it near unusable. Specifically, it's the multi-function button that kills it. The multi-function button covers nearly half the surface of the device and is really easy to press. All well and good, except that by default pressing the multi-function once redials the last number. What this leads to is a flood of ""pocket dialing"" if you happen to put this in your pocket, or even just when you're trying to put the thing in your ear. I've taken to dialing my voicemail constantly just so that if my WEP500 accidentally dials a number it won't be anybody I know. That's an insane hoop to have to jump through just because of a bluetooth headset. If you're going to leave this headset in your car or on your desk, and be extra careful every time you insert the earpiece, the device is fine. If you expect to ever transport this with you anywhere, or are less than careful handling it, then this is a headache. It may be small, and may work fine from a technical standpoint, but this devices drawbacks make it near-unusable.",negative
"I bought this phone in july 2010 for my mom. We are in March 2011 and already giving headaches.

"I bought the firefly mobile phone for my 8 year old. Shipping was fast, we ordered it on Friday and got it on Tuesday. On Tuesday I tried to activate the phone, in which the website kept telling me the SIM card number was not correct. The company closes at 4pm my time, so it was too late to call them by that time. So I called the firefly company on Wednesday and they got the phone activated. Later that day I went back on the website to try and create a phone plan so we could actually make calls. Well the website was down and I couldn't get a plan. So I called them again on Wednesday and they told me there whole system was down and they would give me a call back when the system came back up. Well Thursday morning they still didn't call me, so i called them again. They said that I couldn't add a plan to the phone because my SIM card was messed up (again). She said she would try and fix it and call me back. Thursday night I got an email from the SIM card company in which they activated my phone AGAIN and it seemed to be working. I went online Thursday night and finally was able to add a plan to my sons phone. After all that, the phone seems to be working great. My son loves it, and paying $10 a month so that he can call me is well worth it.",neutral
"First: Everybody complains about the range only being 20-30 feet. This is because of how Bluetooth itself works, not because of this headset. Second: Complicated button sequences come with the territory. If you want a small headset that only fits on one ear, then there is limited room for buttons. All headsets have the same general key sequences. I am pleased with this headset. The microphone is not the best out there, but you will have to pay 3-4 times as much to get only slightly better quality.",positive
"I am very pleased with the funtionality of the phone - 1) The Phonebook is great with the multiple phone numbers per person (H, M, W). 2) Very easy to switch between speaker, handset or headset. 3) I like how the call log shows ALL calls or can be filtered down to 'missed', 'dialed' and 'answered'. Two drawbacks so far - 1) The pain in & around my ear from the earpiece and earloop ***very uncomfortable if you have petite ears*** For someone used to Jabra's gel earpieces this is a huge let down. Hopefully I will toughen up as the funtionality makes the phone a keeper, in spite of the pain. 2) The ringtones leave much to be desired - I can only tolorate the default one.",positive
"The product was delivered on time & in excellent packaging, therefore 5 stars for the delivery. For some reason, though, the ear pieces don't really stay in the ear - at least one keeps falling out (1) due to it's design (2) due to the insufficient length of the cord on the side of one of the ear pieces which leads to a lot of weight being supported on one side of it and not much on the other..

Will not send texts properly, nor receive them, using the same T-Mobile service as on a previous RAZR V3. Will also not send nor receive picture messages. Cannot find a mode for predictive text messaging. And, the case doesn't even fit properly on the phone.

"The OEM Blackberry Curve Charging Station is a fine piece of desktop jewelery. It looks great, and the Curve easily slips into the dock. The device does what is supposed to (after confirming with BB Technical Support), but doesn't do the things I thought it would based on its description. 1. The device will not sync simply when docked. It still requires the USB plug to be inserted into the mini USB slot on the side of the device. This is not convenient for those not on an Enterprise plan, and require manual syncing. 2. The LED's will always stay lit (white) when the device has power (AC Power or USB powered). They do not turn off, or change colors, to indicate any change of status (i.e. new message, charge completed, etc.). If you are looking for a convenient way to charge your Curve without having to plug in the mini USB chord, this device is for you.

"I really love the features of this phone. Everything everyone says that it has - it has. Mine came with up to 7 hours of talk time, which in real talk time is about 3-4 hours which is excellent. It also came with 16 mb of memory which is awesome because no other phone had it. Here's the but .... My husband's screen went out on 2 of them! I thought, unlucky break. We both came eligible for upgrades in January 2008, but I decided to keep my phone because it is sooo good! My husband was using an old phone we had in storage because his screens had gone out way ahead of upgrade time - so of course he upgraded. About a week after he upgraded, I noticed my screen didn't come up with the call - it was very slow. Before I could take the time to get upgraded and have a new phone on the way - my screens blanked out. First the inside screen - now the outside too. Yes, I can answer it if it rings. No, I cannot tell who is calling unless I specified a ringtone for them, thankfully, I did for my family. No, I cannot tell if I missed a call, or have messages waiting, and obviously, I cannot check text messages and there is no access to my address book.

"I would definitely say that this phone is one of the best looking phone out there. But the Cingular Motorola RAZR black that i got a couple of months ago.

Pretty bad. i had to go 4 times replacement in 2 weeks and it still buzzing on lcd and keypad. well i got no choice but buy a different phone. i'm not sure if this a software issue or just the phone itself. anyone have the same problem??

"I read some of the reviews and hesitated to buy this, as I was afraid I would encounter the buzzing feedback noise that some people have been complaining about (Kensington actually has a fix, btw -- they will ship you a free ground loop isolator, which is supposed to fix the problem, though this sounds like a real hassle to my ears). Anyway, I went ahead an ordered this and took a chance because it sounded like exactly the type of thing I needed to use with my iPhone 3GS in my '07 Subaru Outback. I figured that I would just send it back to Amazon if I encountered any buzzing. The upshot is that I got this device, and the setup was super easy -- up and running in under 5 minutes. Then came the moment of truth: how would it sound? Well... I'm happy to report that it works and sounds great -- no buzzing at all (maybe the feedback that a few other people are experiencing is a function of the vehicle they're driving?). The sound is rich and full bodied and makes the stock stereo actually sound halfway decent. Phone conversations work like a dream. The only real downside of using it with the iPhone is that you can only use the remote to play/pause. The Next Track and Previous Track buttons don't work at all, which I understand is a problem with the way Bluetooth has been implemented on the iPhone. This is a small thing (for me at least) because the rest of the functions all work as advertised. Once you've paired the LiquidAux Bluetooth with your iPhone, just make sure Bluetooth is turned on on your iPhone, and then every time you start up your car, you're just set to start streaming audio (music and phone) to the device and out through aux cable to your stereo. Pros: - Very easy to set up - Sound quality is excellent, both for music and for phone conversations - Excellent value for the money. Adds Bluetooth functionality to your car for a fraction of the cost that car manufacturers charge to have built-in Bluetooth. - On my vehicle, it installs in a very low profile. Don't even notice it's there. They definitely didn't feel the need to have lots of bright and distracting flashing lights. - Once paired, it reconnects with the iPhone very quickly -- as soon as you start up your car. - Charges your iPhone (you have to provide a USB to iPhone cable, though) - No wires to your iPhone (unless you choose to charge the iPhone with the cable). - A female-male aux extension cable is included if you need to run the Aux cable further (I did.) Cons: - You still have at least one wire (the one that goes to the Aux jack in your car) -- two wires if you're charging your phone, too. - You need to buy something extra so that you can have someplace handy to put your phone if you don't want it floating around the cup holders or console or wherever (I got the Kensington windshield iPhone mount -- works great --&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kensington-Windshield-suction-mount/dp/B000W0ATGS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kensington - Windshield suction mount</a>) - Some people have complained about a buzzing feedback noise from the engine. This hasn't been a problem for me ('07 Subaru Outback). - With iPhone, only the play/pause button works for music on the remote. In any case, I think the pros greatly outweigh the cons for me, and so I highly recommend this device to iPhone users, though YMMV regarding the buzzing noise.",positive

I do not store my Z9 in my pocket or in extreme temperatures, but each time, within a matter of about 7-9 weeks, the rubber earpiece rips off. As stated in another review, the earpiece seems to be on backorder in most places. Moreover, at 9.99 per piece, you may quickly find that you spend more on replacement parts than on the Z9 itself. You may want to take steps to ensure that the earpiece is handled very delicately to prevent ripping. Otherwise, this would be a near-perfect headset.",neutral

"Overall, the Motorola Buds are a decent Bluetooth headset. The sound quality for phone calls and music is good, and they are comfortable to wear. I use them with an iPhone 6 and they work well with it. I have tested walking about 50 feet away from my phone and the sound is perfect, even with a couple walls in the way. I have a few things that I wish were better, though, which is why I deducted one star: 1. There is no way to tell the battery status until it is low and the headset tells you. Then you only have 5 or 10 minutes before the battery is completely dead. Other headsets have a battery indicator on the phone screen; no such thing with these. Even the ability to press a button and have it tell you approximately how much time is left would be helpful, but again this headset doesn't do this. (Maybe with an Android phone? But I don't know.) 2. The microphone is extremely sensitive. I'm not sure what Motorola considers ""noise canceling"", but it doesn't appear that this headset has any. I have used Jawbone headsets in the past and those things are amazing at noise cancellation. But the Motorola Buds picks up people talking at normal levels in the other room and it is heard by the caller. 3. When watching a video, the sound is not synchronized with the video. I don't know if this is just something with all Bluetooth headsets, but it is a bit confusing when the mouth moves then you hear the words a 1/2 second or so later, almost like an old Japanese kung fu movie. Unfortunately, this makes the headset a poor choice for watching YouTube or other streaming video. Other than these minor issues, I like the Motorola Buds. They were a great value for the money and sound good, so I don't have any plans to change them out in the near future.",positive

"This has been my first and only phono preamp I've purchased for my system and I'm extremely happy with its performance. I'm using a Rega RP1 turntable, an Onkyo reciever (700 series, about 8 years old at this point), and Polk floorstanding speakers. Even with budget components the system sounds great. The reason I was prompted to write this review after owning the preamp for years was the customer service from Phono Pre-Amps. After two years of fairly regular use, the right channel output inexplicably stopped working. I opened up the unit to see if I could diagnose the problem but with my very limited electronics knowledge I wasn't able to figure it out after poking around with a multimeter. With the clean and simple construction, however, a person with more electronics knowledge could surely have repaired it themselves. Defeated, I contacted the manufacturer customer service and was informed the preamp comes with a limited lifetime warranty and it could be fixed it free of charge. I shipped it to them in December 2014 and within two weeks it was returned to me working like new. Taped to the invoice was the leaky transistor that was causing the problem!",positive

"Cell phone service is critical in my line of work. I drive a lot for my company & communication is key to get the job done fast. I needed something that will help me boost the signal & help lessen the dropped calls I experience when I'm on the road. I saw the many positive reviews on Amazon so I said ""sure I will give it a try"". If it helps with at least one extra bar signal it would be better than nothing. Installation was easy but I guess it would depend on your vehicle also and how you would want to mount it. The hardware looked commercial grade to withstand some punishment but it is not bullet proof. Instructions are easy to read & understand. Upon using it in the city I did notice an increase of full bars in most places. Out in the country was a different story. I saw 2-3 bars which was strong enough for internet use & phone calls. Then I took it to areas where I know I get dropped calls & no signal. This Wilson Electronics unit helped by getting 1 signal bar at the most. Enough to make or receive phone calls but internet took forever. I still experienced a dropped call here and there but not as much as I use to. So it actually works but it is not the miracle maker I though it would be. For the cost I would say not worth it if your going to use it sparingly. If you travel a lot in your vehicle, like everyday, I would say get it at the lowest price possible. It could pay off if you don't lose a sale because of a dropped call or no signal. So get it if you live off cell phone use. Leave it if you don't. That is my 2 cents. I have not tried it for mifi internet units because I don't have one yet. So I don't know if it would help that signal as claimed by Wilson Electronics.",neutral

"I tried two other Bluetooth headsets before this one. Both of the prior ones didn't fit right, were hard to hear, and provided poor voice quality (despite being made by a major vendor). I was about to give up after multiple trips to BestBuy, and decided to give Amazon a try (since the local BestBuys were out of Jabra products -- and now I see why). The Jabra arrived, and saved the day! It charged right up in its cool cradle, matched with the phone (Treo 650) immediately, and fit beautifully. It's lightweight, you can hear the people you're calling, and you sound great to them. I'm very impressed by the design (fit, form factor, buttons, charger) and utility. What a find!",positive

"This replaces an identical unit....which only failed when I squeezed the padded arms/clamp a little too hard.

I do find myself occasionally lifting the iphone in its cradle up for optimum viewing....but then, the roads here in NJ suck, and I'm riding a Jeep, so....bumps happen. I think I have found the sweet spot where the clamps are squeezed tightly enough to hold the iphone, but not so tight as to break the arms. AND, past experience tells me that come summer, there may be a day when the suction cup just pops off the windshield. Overall I'm very happy with it; the price was right....delivery took a little while. The alternatives for me would be a vent mount (Would pull the vent louvers right out of the vent) or parking the phone in the cup holder (fine for bluetooth calls, not so good for using the GPS)",neutral

"Like the other review title says... it works. I actually paid the $8 shipping on it just to get it sooner and it did get here only a couple days after it was shipped. I have redone this review many times to try to get it more accurate as I have used it more. I put a link to a video which shows how to use this. You receive a link to it when you buy this, but obviously it would be good if you could see it before you buy it (which you can, but Amazon deleted it). At least in my experience that video is not totally accurate though. You should watch it to understand how to put the battery in, but as far as the steps go... it didn't work that way for me. In the video it shows pressing a button before ever plugging it in. Well it didn't seem to work thatw ay for me the first time. But now it DOES seem to work that way. So keep moving the metal prongs around until that left button does make a light come on. Secondly, it shows that a light flashes green when it's charging. It actually flashes red for me... And I took it out after a few hours and put it in my phone and it was mostly charged, so it apparently is working... while flashing red, not green. Like someone else who wrote a review on here... I bought this because apparently a pin in the phone got bent beecause the charger for my phone would not fit snugly and it would not charge at all. I checked out reviews for cell phones and went and looked at some and none of them impress me so I figured it would be worth $11 to get this charger shipped to me and then I can decide on some new phone later if I want. Anyway put the battery in like it shows in the video. Then plug it in. One red light will automatically be on to show the power is on. If the second red light does not start flashing then press the button on the right of the charger to flip polarity. Maybe even hold it down. If it still doesn't start flashing then you probably need to mess around with how the pins are lined up against your battery and then try again. I think some of these may be slightly different also. Someone in one of the other reviews on here said there is no english on the box. Well on mine there is english, but just not good english. Also like I said it flashes red, not green. So maybe some different versions exist. The more I use this the more I don't like it, though. You can't even tell if it's really charging! The first time I charged it, it had a flashing red light. Then when finished the battery lasted 89 hours before it even lost a bar. However THEN I charged it again and left it on there for more than 24 HOURS STRAIGHT. Then I finally took it out and tried it and it had not charged AT ALL even though that same red flight flashed as if it was charging! edit: Now it charged properly again. It charges properly if you do get that light to show up before plugging ti in. So in summary, if you have no choice but to use an external battery charger, you might as well get this. But it's not the most ideal thing ever. You have to be desperate if you resort to using this. I'm going to ahve to just buy a new phone because I can't keep dealing with something which flashes as if it's charging and isn't always even really charging! And if I take the battery out to test if it's really charging then it's hard to line it back up properly so it may not be charging the next time either.",neutral
The phone is fine. I've purchased many items from Amazon over the years and am one of their biggest fans. On this purchase however I had to go through a vendor ( Ace Digital ) and cannot recommend them. Phone came quickly but it became evident it had been used before ( issues with memory stick for one ). Also needed to purchase separately at Radio Shack a charger adapter as the one included with the w800i ( i for international ) is for European use only! Amazon does not involve itself with third party vendors (understood) but our two phone conversations with Ace Digital in Brooklyn were unpleasant to say the least. Very rude and uncooperative. We were told they would be making an exception in accepting our return for refund. Phone was insured and shipped back at our cost of course and I'll keep you updated on when we are credited.,positive
"I thought this would be a convenient product to use when I need to charge my Ipod, boy was I wrong. First off, you will only get a complete charge if your battery is more than half full.

"I bought this product recently to help my long trip to Asia. I read a lot of good reviews of this product and was hoping that this product will help me enjoy my iPhone apps over the 14 hour flight to Asia. It worked fine without any issues on the way there from the US. However, on the way back, it was a completely different story. I had it fully charged to 4 dots before I took the flight. My iPhone battery % was low to start with. But I wasn't so worried because of this extra battery I had. About 2 hours into this long 14 hour flight, my iPhone battery was under 10%. So, I pulled out this battery and tried to charge my iPhone. But to my shock, I could NOT turn this on with whatever combinations of clicks. It was absolutely devastating with 12 more hours of flight to go. Eventually, I pulled out my laptop and connected this battery to my laptop using the provided cable. Magically this ""activated"" the battery (which showed 4 dots - fully charged) and I was able to charge my iPhone the rest of the way. I was going to regard this incident as a one-time fluke. But the same behavior just happened again this morning and I had to use the same trick to ""activate"" the unit. This is not a reliable product and I have lost my confidence in it.

"Pro: I bought a second set of these, one set for my wife, after I fell in love with mine. The sound quality is great and they fit snug and secure blocking out ambient noise. They have a good max volume and nice bass response. They definitely beat out ANY pair of in-ear headphones I have even owned. And I even own a very expensive pair of in-ear monitors that I'd trade in a heartbeat for the sound of these bluetooth headphones. Con: After about 6 weeks of heavy usage with my first pair, the very thin plastic began to crack over my right ear. Due to the cracked plastic, they lost some of their snug fit. I used some electrical tape to fix them, but the tape also made them less comfortable to wear. Shortly after this, the left side cracked, too. Taped it, too, but the crack was considerably worse. It wound up cracking all the way through and was only held together by the wiring. Taped again. They work still but they are uncomfortable to wear, they don't get a snug fit so I get ambient noise and have some volume loss. Lucky for me, my wife never uses hers, so I do. But, I am very careful with them while in use as well as where I store them. I would recommend these despite the trouble I have had due to their sound quality and relatively affordable cost, however I would also suggest that they be very cautiously handled and stored.",neutral

"i was mildly excited to get this new phone after losing my lg vx6000, which i really liked. i liked the lg vx6000 because of its convenient camera, its ability to have mp3 ringtones (via some easyhacks), its ability to sync via bitpim (a great tool, look it up on the web!), and its decently small size. when i upgraded to the v710, my first hesitation was its ginormous (enormous) size. it's bigger than motorola's old star tac line, which for the better half of a decade set the golden standard. compared to the lg vx6000, this motorola v710 is a big, big, clunker, the land yacht of modern cell phones. one _might_ think that my concern about the size is all image-based; but no, the size creates serious problems. for one thing, the phone is heavy and easily falls off whatever its clipped to (belt, bag, etc.) because of its weight and its clumsy holster. secondly, the giant size makes the phone get in the way of daily activities. this phone ought to be as slim as motorola's razr v3 phone. originally, i was pretty excited to get a 1.2 mp camera and a camcorder. of course, i think this imaging chip is a cmos not a ccd, which is a negative, but one i'm willing to accept for the sake of size and price. however, when you first take the phone out of the box, you will have the ultimate problem of figuring out how to transfer the photos and videos off your phone to your computer. it seems that verizon tries to trap you into using their extremely overpriced pixplace service. at 25 cents an upload, you can easily rack up a bill as enormous as this phone's body. what's the use in owning a digital camera, if you need to pay in order to retrieve your pictures? that's like owning a film camera! it appears that originally, we were supposed to transfer our pictures via this phone's nice bluetooth functionality. however, what i'm hearing is that verizon purposely dumbed down this phone's bluetooth functionality in order to armbar us into using their expensive (and inconvenient) data transfer services. after all, we should've been able to transfer mp3s to our motorola v710 phones via bluetooth in order to use them as ringtones or with the built-in mp3 player. the only way to get around this data transfer dilemma is to buy the moderately priced transflash ram card. sandisk makes a nice 256mb transflash ram card, which has greatly improved my relationship with this phone. it's feels more like a quick fix than an ideal solution, which would be a wireless or even wired connection direct to my computer. (in fact, earlier, i had purchased a motorola data cable for this phone; but without the expensive software and without the time to implement the hack software, it was of little use to me.) my disappointment over the bluetooth functionality doesn't stop there. i am indeed upset that i can't transfer files to my computer via the bluetooth connection but am further unhappy that i cannot interface the phone via bluetooth with my palmone tungsten t5. one would expect that i could use the pda's phonebook from my phone via the wireless connection. from what i'm hearing, one of the few things this bluetooth i/o is good for is one of those expensive wireless handsfree kits. luckily, the phone has a built-in speakerphone that provides a good handsfree solution, one of this phone's only positives. i do enjoy the camera with somewhat satisfactory flash and the camcorder. the still images come out nice at 1.2 mp, admittedly better than the pictures from my old lg vx6000. i also enjoy the self-portrait mode, where you close the lid and use the _outside_ screen as the viewfinder. (this could function as a makeshift mirror if needed.) the biggest negative about the camcorder is that the video is stored in this awkward .3g2 (3gpp) format, which is incompatible with windows media player and seems only to work with apple quicktime. it seems that verizon is pushing its customers to upgrade from lg vx6000 phones to these motorola v710 phones. it _is_ a natural evolution from small still pics to video clips. however, verizon's definitely taken this opportunity to attempt to foil the gadget guru crowd, which previously enjoyed hacks for free wireless web and the like. considering that customers will find they need to buy more of verizon's services in order to use this phone verizon ought to be paying the customers to switch to this phone. perhaps, the closest we'll get to that situation is a free-after-rebate deal.",negative

"Okay, so I have an LG Shine. And on that LG Shine I have about, oh lets say, 500 photos. So, I tried to be smart and read all of the reviews of the usb cable on this website. I waited about 3 days until it got here; very fast shipping in my book. It was easy to install. I can't tell you how many times I've bought things and them be hard to set up/install. I really like how you can transfer music and photos from your memory card. But that's part of the major flaw... It only transfers from your memory card. I received the memory card yesterday (which works just wonderfully!), so I was in good shape. But when I went to transfer the files about thirty minutes ago, I thought it was going to transfer *everything* to my computer. You can't even fathom how disappointed I was when I just saw the ten pictures from my memory card instead of the 500+ pics from my phone itself (before I got the memory card). So, my big advice? If you're looking for a usb cable to transfer files from your memory card AND phone, don't buy this. However, if you already have most of your pictures saved on your memory card (unlike me), go ahead and buy it. It does a great job of transferring. Overall, it's very nice. Easy installion, fast transfer, charges your phone as it's plugged into your computer. I just really wish it transferred my countless number of photos on my phone's memory.",neutral

"I've had this for two months, and while it is decent basic headset, there are major flaws. For reference's sake, I have this paired with a new Motorola L6 I got in May. The main power button is at best unreliable, and after reading reviews elsewhere I have come to the conclusion that this wasn't a faulty unit, it is endemic to the line--the power button is just faulty, twitchy, unreliable, whatever you want to call it. Additionally, I thought the AAA battery thing would be a great idea. Instead I've noticed that not only does the battery not last as long as advertised (assuming it's the battery and not the power button, which is not fun to determine), within six months of even theoretical normal usage the value over a charger solution vanishes.

"It is located some distance from the computer at the other end of a 15 foot USB extension cable and generally has 6 or 7 devices plugged in at a time. Having a second location for USB ports has avoided a lot of wiring. It has no problem handling a printer, several scanners, backup disks, and charging iphones and tablets. Sometimes 3 or 4 devices are active at the same time. I have been using it for 10 months so I can attest to reliability. I have done some speed measurements on backups and it is going at the same speed as if the backup disk were plugged directly into the computer. Also looks really cool.",positive
The headset is nice and lightweight. Try a couple of the ear pieces and find the one that works for you. First one didn't work quite well but the second one I tried was the perfect fit. Sound is clear and nice no problems there.,positive
"I didn't think I would say this, but the Jawbone, though its loop is annoyingly cumbersome to get around the ear in a hurry, is actually better. I was hoping that this Etymotic would be a better headset, well, it's about the same sound quality but loses in the comfort level. Do you like them ear plugs that block out the noise? That weird sensation of your ear being plugged? Well, this Bluetooth headset uses the same plugged-in-your-ear technology of the rubbery tri-level ear-plug to shove it in your ear nice and tight, to block out ambient noise. One problem: if you are not having a conversation, then you feel like your ear is really just plugged, as if you are deaf in that one ear - which is the function of that rubbery ear-plug!!! So, for me, while I am driving, it is seriously dangerous. I can hear damn well out of one ear but because the other one is so plugged, it is un-balancing, if you get my meaning? None of the ear pieces offered in the package sit comfortably in my ear. Besides, I do not like things shoved that far in my ear anyways, nor do I want to be so plugged that it is lopsided like that. If the plugged-in sensation is both ears and I am a musician then it's fine, since I will have both ears plugged this way - but to be one-sided like this made me feel like a freak. I like the overall look and design, but because the piece that is supposed to go in your ear has a piece that sticks out so far, it sort of dangles out from my cheek and I wish it would sit more flush. I have to use the loop over the ear, otherwise it is too far from my face and I end up feeling like I have to shout to get my point across. I was hoping that the extension microphone piece would help, but with that plugged-up feeling being so strong, I really can't tell if this is any better. I keep asking people if they can hear me OK but I'm not sure. Ah well - the search continues for the perfect Bluetooth headset. To this day nothing beats bringing the whole cellphone to my face - it just sounds so much clearer. I am amazed that there aren't more, super-cool designed Bluetooth headsets out there - I guess people still don't mind putting the hot cellphone to their faces - and may be these bluetooth headsets are too expensive for what they are. They ought to be giving these damned things away by now. And, I wouldn't mind if some of the office wireless headset designs were transported over to the Bluetooth headsets for cellphones.",neutral
"This is the best noise canceling bluetooth I have tried, but the static when your phone is on your belt or if you get more than a few feet away is unacceptable. I have paired this with several phones with the same resulting static. I'm rma'ing it to etymotics for replacement. Crossing my fingers, I wan't this to work. Everyone I talk to when my phone is on the dash in front of me in a noisy truck say it sounds better than even my wired Shure quietspot, which was the best noise canceling unit so far.",neutral
"The battery is an excellent replacement for the existing Razr V3c battery. The 1400mAh version is thicker than the original so after the new cover is added, it creates a small step on the back of the phone. The cover matches the color of my Razr and fits perfectly. With moderate use, I now can go nearly 3 days on a single charge.",positive

"A word about Sprint: They used to be the best, and they are now the worst. The absolute worst. If you call them today, July 15'th 2008, you will get through the prompts until you are given a wait-time and then the systems tells you to call back later and hangs up on you. I'm not surprised at all. They got rid of 80 % of their customer service workforce. Things have appeared on my bill for a year that shouldn't be there. I have made 5 attempts to fix this and finally gave up. Plan on a two-hour call to get something accomplished and then prepare yourself to be utterly crazed with anger when you see that nothing was actually done several times. A lady from Sprint called me trying to sell something and extend my contract, I laughed so hard, that she actually tried to fix my problems. She said she did and of course, it's still on my bill.

"When I first read a review of this product online, I was quite impressed...finally, an iPod mount that would work. When I received it and put it together, I was disappointed. Allow me to elaborate...Griffin has a good idea here; instead of a goose-neck, it uses a ball-and-socket joint-type system of arms to position your iPod touch/iPhone. The problem here is that you have a limited amount of positions to put your iPod in. Second, the suction cup is not as strong as it needs to be; it's a good idea on paper (instead of a snap-down toggle like most mounts, it's a screw-down type that should hold the suction cup more securely to the windshield), but the suction cup is very difficult to get to stick to the windshield, and you have to really press hard against it while screwing it down, and even then it would detach from my windshield at the worst possible moment (driving down the Garden State Parkway at 70 miles an hour). Third, it will not work with iPods/iPhones in cases...I don't want to have to remove my iTouch from its case every time I want to take it on the road. Griffin has a decent product here that just has a few problems that prevent it from being a great one. If they address the suction-cup issue, and make a mount that allows for holding an iPod in a case, this would be a much better product.",neutral

"This is a good case. When I initially put it on, it fit on my 3rd gen Ipod perfectly. It also looks really sharp and the plastic over the screen is a nice touch to give the screen the protection it needs. It'll do its job very well. All ports are accessible and it is easy to plug into my computer or into my car jack so I can listen to my music in my car. The only thing it will not fit is my IHome. This is minor to me as it is not used frequently, but I thought I would add my two cents, seeing as there were already reviews about it working on other ports...other ports, but not my IHome. Here are the problems: First, I am an intelligent man and know how to work most electronics I've come across. When I received this case, however, the clip that goes along with was not built onto the case and so I had quite a hard time figuring out how it was supposed to fit. Second, I would had liked the clip to had looked like the rest of the case...the white clip looks a little tacky connected to an otherwise clear and sharp looking case. Third, the clip itself spins and doesn't stay put. In real life I don't believe this will be much of a problem as I have a case I put my Ipod in and so will not use the clip as much, but still I question why it spins. Finally, the thing that bothers me the MOST about the product is how difficult its removal from my Ipod is. Maybe I'm unaware of a special ""trick"" to open it, nut I was unable to open this case using just my fingers. I literally had to take a butter knife and carefully pry the case open so as not to damage the case and especially not my Ipod. I like how it protects my Ipod, but I wish there was easier ways to open the case other than the method I described as it is especially tedious, annoying, and could hurt my Ipod. Regardless, a good product and I'm keeping it.",neutral

"I've been a sprint customer for over three years and have owned three sanyo phones; Sanyo 8100, Sanyo 8300, and the Kantana. If you're coming from a mulitimedia phone like the Sanyo 8300, the SCP-6600 Katana may be a bit of a disappointment to you. The Katana just doesn't have all of the bells and whistles as a multimedia phone. The Katana has no built in flash which is needed for taking half decent pictures with a camera phone. It also has no camcorder or media player. But then again its not suppose to. It's basically an attempt by sprint and Sanyo to satisfy the consumer cravings for the popular RAZR phones that are available through wireless carriers like Cingular, Verizon Wireless, T-Mobile, Cricket and a few others. It's obvious by looking at the Katana that it was inspire by the Razr, which does not have MM functions either. On a feature note I would have to give the Katana a one besides doing the simple things like making phone calls and downloading ringers and screen savers there's just not much more you can do on it. Aesthetically the Katana is not that much of a beaut. However, it is for the time being a bit different looking so for (except when compared to the RAZR) that I'd give it a four. For the lack of a decent camera and camcorder I have to deduct two more points which brings rating down to three stars.

"In February I purchased a Blackberry curve and wanted a bluetooth headset. Unfortunately I can't use the small ear piece blue tooth sets or the ear buds since they won't stay in my ears. After looking all over the local area for an over the head bluetooth headsets and not finding one I checked Amazon and found the Motor Trend MTBT09 Max 4x Bluetooth Wireless Headset, I called the Amazon mobile phone assistance group and checked on the headset to make sure it worked with my phone and the went a head and ordered it. I have a large head and the headset is too small for starters, the band that goes over the head was barely long enough. Once I had it on it the metal arm of the set felt like it was stretched and going to spring off My head any second. Sound quality for me was fine, but half the people I talked to either couldn't hear me well or I sounded like I was in a 50 gallon drum. The headset it self has an cheap plastic kids toy feeling. The one thing I didn't have problems with was talk time or stand by time, that was fine. Until about 2 weeks after I got it and then it refused to charge... I can plug it in and the charger is lit up, but the headset fails to respond. When you plug it in the small LED on the side is supposed to light up red, but nothing... So now I have a 70+ dollar desk decoration... Skip this one and try something else...",negative
"When I first bought this headset, I was pretty satisfied. It handled voice dialing with my Nokia well, and the sound quality was generally good on both ends. The over-the-ear receiver was comfortable and didn't fall off. However, it has exhibited two shortcomings. First, the size is rather awkward. It doesn't fit inside my cell phone case with the phone like my previous headsets would. Second, the sound quality, especially on the receiving end, deteriorated over a few months. This seems to be a very common problem with bluetooth headsets. I've had three different headsets that started out good, but after roughly six months became unintelligible on receiving side. I'm guessing it's something to do with the microphone. Fortunately, this one is cheap enough that replacing it is just an annoyance and not a mahor cost hit.",neutral

"I was very excited to try the Jawbone. And I'm still using it every day. I have found that it's not working very well for me. I can't get the only ear loop included to hold the ear piece near the ear canal. I cannot get the jawbone to stay against my face so that the noise canceling feature works. The persons I am talking to say that I'm breaking up badly, because it's not held against the face bone. When the noise canceling is off, it works fine. I take the index finger of my left hand to hold it against my face while driving, if I feel the need for the noise canceling feature. I do like that the charger works by connecting to the USB port on my computer. However, it is a fight every time, trying to get it to unplug. It has to be at just the right angle in order to get it to release. I particularly like that when I walk out of bluetooth range for a few minutes, when not using it, that it will reconnect to the phone upon returning ... even after as much as three or four minutes.

Shouldn't you have to slide it all the way in to end the call? You'd think. They should call it ""hands-free"" because you'd better not get your hands anywhere near it while your talking!

"The reception between this model and my Treo 650 has been one of the better I've experienced with a Bluetooth headset. Keeping the Treo close, or on the same side of your body is helpful, & I just put the phone in the little well in front of my gearshift in my car. If I have to take a call, I take less risk of wrapping my car around a tree like some idiot going 75 with a phone up to his head, and the reception stays clear. It took me reading the instructions (go figure)to master all of the functions that one button controls, but that seemed to clear up EVERY issue I had with it either NOT answering, or hanging up etc, that others have complained about in previous reviews. My mother actually admits to hearing everything I've said, a change from previous headsets where everyone kept complaining they couldn't hear me (how convenient). So, all in all, the best Bluetooth I've had yet with my Treo 650. Why not a 5th star? Well, it's the hinge that it hangs from. It's not painful as other devices have been, but it's almost too flexible, and unless you get it just right, the device can start to sag off of your ear.

"In the past, I have purchased the Body Glove Cases for other flip phones. However, this one for the Razr is not good. It is a struggle to even get it on the phone and the openings for the charger, earpiece etc do not line up properly. My husband did complain about the clip and indicated that it released a few times when he sat down. Although I have been a fan of their cell phone cases in the past, I am disappointed in this one. We have replaced it with the Motorola brand leather case.",negative
"I was hoping for a little more when I upgraded my old Motorola headset for this one. Here are the pros: - Fits snuggly in your ear with two different sizes of earpieces and a comfortable ear hook - Pairs easily with my phone and I like the one-touch auto pair feature - Volume is good and clear - Looks very professional And here are the cons: - Battery life is way less than advertised. My motorola can go days without needing a charge and it seems like a day of the same amount of talking with the BlueAnt eats up the battery - When the headset is running out of battery and you are using it, it lets you know it is going to die by beeping and dying a few seconds later. I would have liked a little more notice. - The noise cancelling for wind doesn't seem to work that well. I was trying to use it while cruising on my bicycle and the person I was talking to said they couldn't hear me at all. All they could hear was the wind. All in all, I like the product mostly because it fits better and is more secure than my old headset. But, as far as performance goes I don't think it is any better. If you need to get a headset or replace a broken one, this is a great headset to get. If you already have one and are looking to upgrade, you might be able to find something better.",neutral
"I love the Otterbox holster for the protection it provides my phone. However, the spring will wear out after nine months or so of use. I had to take the spring out and adjust it so it would work. But it only lasted for a few weeks before the clip was loose again. This model (for the Black Berry Curve 8330) has the ability to swivel (which apparently all of their holsters do, I am told). Again, after nine months or so of use the holster will swivel much too easily. I don't like the ability of the holster to swivel so I fixed that with some screws. I used a screw to fix the clip as well. Customer service from Otter Box is certainly lacking. I contacted them with the following message: Hi. I purchased my Otter Box Defender on May 24, 2009 from Amazon.com LLC. Recently, the belt clip that rotates on the holster is so loose that it rotates on my belt too easily. The spring on the clip itself is so weak that I have had my phone drop off of my belt and land on the floor. Is there any way to replace the rotating belt clip? I love my Otter Box and the protection it gives my phone. I don't want to give it up for something with less protection but has better components. Thank you. The following was the only response received: Update for Case #93443 - ""Holster clip"" If you send me your name address and phone type that we are carrying. Thanks, [name of customer service rep] I don't know what they were going to do to resolve this. I thought that by asking for my name and address they would have sent me another holster. I never heard from them after that. It was (and is) within the one year warranty period. Get the Otterbox if you want the protection it provides but be prepared to make some fixes yourself. Don't get it for the lack of customer service or the components that will eventually fail.",neutral

"After my experience with the Motorola V551, I wanted to get away from Motorola, and try something other than a flip-phone. The phone I had before that was a Nokia bar, and I liked that, but, wanted to try a Slider. I don't think I could have picked a better phone! I love the menu system. Like my old Nokia, you remember certain options, and can quick key them by ""address."" Say, for instance, you want the 4th option of the menu, then 3rd, then 5th, all you have to do is press Menu, 4,3, then 5, and you are there. I love the phone quality, and the reception (incoming) is as good as the outgoing. My cellphone is better than any phones I have used at home, and those are on Digital Cable Phone lines. One worry I quickly fixed was a dedicated WAP / ON-LINE button. I simply gave the WAP address an incorrect symbol (put a . where it did not belong) and it won't access the internet when I accidentally press the button. The ONLY complaint I have is that it could use 1 or 2 higher levels of volume through the earpiece. If you are looking for a great Slider, or want to try a new company because you had a bad experience with someone else (like Motorola for instance), this is a WONDERFUL phone!",positive

"I got this as a single device replacement for my cell phone and Palm Vx. Its performance as a phone has been a tremendous improvement over my old Ericsson T19LX - call quality using AT&T service in New York is great, as is having my PDA address book integrated with the phone so I don't have to worry about updating phone numbers in multiple places. The size is quite respectable considering how much functionality it contains, but definitely somewhat large for a current model phone. As a PDA, it is functional but suffers from some flaws. Importing contacts from Palm Desktop did not work - many entries where I had a home and mobile number showed up with one entry called homemobile and dropped the other number. When I moved everything to Outlook and synchronized it worked fine. However, it still does not sync note fields for to-do and calendar entries, and Nokia says they have no plans to fix that. The phone's to-do editor does not let you make an entry without a due date, and also does not let you turn off the alarm that occurs on the due date. Accessing POP3 email works, but if you want to delete a message from the phone while leaving it on your server you still have to leave the header on the phone and scroll past it in your inbox. I solved some other problems by installing ActiveDesk and ActiveMail from Cibenix, which I would definitely recommend if you purchase this phone. Overall, I would give this 5 stars for packing some great hardware into an attractive package with great phone functionality at a good price. However, the PDA software flaws knock it down a notch.",positive

"Overall I think that this is a good case for the phone. I bought it b/c I thought it would do a good job protecting the camera lens, which it doesn't really succeed in doing. I've had it for 3 weeks now, and the camera lens is getting dusty. If I had been using the belt clip it comes with, it would have bulged the back out even more, and made it even dustier. So I think that for the amount of money they are selling this case, you can find other ones cheaper that do the same thing. But the case itself is very sturdy and does a good job protecting the phone, just not the lens.",neutral

"I bought this headset because it will connect to a computer and thusly can be used for Skype. Supposedly, many Bluetooth headsets can accomplish this task, but of the three we had in the house, none could (apparently, the headset must be capable of entering ""discovery"" mode to tie-in with a computer, versus just ""pairing mode""). So, I did a little research, and this is one of the Bluetooth headsets that can DEFINITELY work with a computer. And that much is true; the Audio 920 can connect to a computer, and quite effortlessly in fact. I have a G5 iMac (with iSight), which already has Bluetooth built-in. After charging the A920 and putting in into ""discovery"" mode, I had no problem finding it with my Mac and making a connection. Other than the fact that it will connect to a computer without hassle, I have nothing positive to say about this device. First and foremost, the sound and mic quality compared to a computer is HORRENDOUS. When my Mac made system sounds, they sounded horrible horrible horrible. Five-dollar headphones will reproduce beeps and blurps with more fidelity. More importantly, and worst still, was the quality of Skype conversations. I am new to Bluetooth, but to me it seems like a worthless technology. I tested this headset in a completely open room, and if you are anywhere but immediately next to the receiving device, there are noticeable degradations in sound-quality. In fact, about an hour into a conversation, I switched-off the headset because the other party could hardly hear me and described me as a ""robot"". I did try using the included USB Bluetooth stick, which also connects effortlessly, but it didn't really improve the sound-quality. When using the USB Bluetooth stick, I must admit that there was a slight improvement, but I also called a US landline (versus a Mexican landline), so I can't be sure which variable was more responsible for the change. The set itself is relatively nice feeling, but it would not stay in my ear and I have NEVER had that problem with an earpiece before. I wouldn't say I have an ideal ear-opening, but earpieces always work, and if anything, tend to be too big versus the A920 which is tiny. After much fiddling, I could find a sweet-spot and without much movement it would stay put. I can't imagine how this device must fit for everyone else. All in all, I DO NOT RECOMMEND the A920, at least if your plan is to use it for Skype / computer connection. For the high-price (I could only find the A920 paired with the USB Bluetooth stick, which cost $85), it's simply not worth it. The call-quality, the one area that I will not sacrifice, is poor, at best. I am apparently forced to spend at least twice as much and buy a VoIP / Skype phone because the Bluetooth option isn't adequate.",negative

Call quality: the people I've talked to didn't even realize I was using a bluetooth, and I don't speak very loudly typically and don't have to talk loudly at all for the person on the other end to hear me clearly. On my end it did sound like I was talking through a bluetooth, but it wasn't hard to deal with (its hard to describe, but the person's sound is clear but its just not what talking on a cell sounds like natively). I have absolutely no problem with it, but it could have been better (speaking specifically about the incoming sound quality). Great for walking around campus listening to music and talking to people if a call comes in. One last thing, it could be my weird ears but even when walking somewhat quickly, not even running I sometimes notice a small sound as they move up and down my ear ever so slightly. This might make running with them annoying, but I haven't tried it, but maybe others listen to music a lot higher, but I prefer to be among the hearing.",positive

You will have to deal with the ""hassle"" of giving your contact info to everyone who needs it, but it could potentially save you hundreds of dollars.

"What an awesome design. Being a HUGE Apple Mac user and fan, I truly appreciate this phone. Apple has always been known for their awesome design work. The phone is great with two exceptions; the volume out of the built in speaker on the phone is too low when you are driving with your windows down or sunroof open and the phonebook accessibility is not great. I upgraded to this phone from an old Nokia that had decent volume and the phonebook was accessible by using the keypad to type the first few letters of someones name. Motorola does not allow that with this phonebook. You put in the first letter of the name and then scroll through the names until you get to the number. Not the most efficient method when you have over 200 names in your phonebook. I have been syncing the phone using OS X iSync (Address Book & iCal) over Bluetooth with no problems at all. It works great! All my names and numbers show up on the phone as well as my calendar which is a very nice upgrade over the Nokia which would not sync with OS X. I am going to get a Bluetooth headset and that should solve the volume issue.",positive

After that my phone wouldn't stay charged for very long and reception got worse, also the screen started to fade. So first I got an internal antenna, it didn't help. So I went to a t-mobile store to get a new battery, the sales person told me they didn't have any for my phone in stock and told me to buy one from another company online that they were just as good. I did, holds charge even less time then the old one. Well this morning, for the second time my phone turned itself off while charging and dumped all my wallpapers, ALL, I don't even have the ones that came with the phone, I have a white screen. It also dumped all my purchased ringtones. And now after charging all last night my phone is dead, it died around 2:00pm.

"I'll start off by saying i got a great deal on this phone ($75) so i'm definitely happy with my purchase. For me there are 2 main drawbacks with this phone. The first was noted by another reviewer which is there is no silent way to go from having the ring on to turning it off as it rings at each regression from level 5 to silent, you can't turn it from ringer to silent another way. You can just turn the phone off but thats annoying too since you cant see what you missed. The other main drawback is that the volume is wayyyy too low. When i'm in any sort of social setting I have a real problems hearing what the other person is saying, even at a mildy busy bar with no music on, just the general activity in the bar is enough to have me straining. But that being said I do enjoy the phone, I can usually find some place quiet enough or step outside and i'm in the habit now of fiddling witht he ring volume before i go somewhere quiet or just turn it off when i get in. It's not that big of a deal. I have no problems with anything else, i find it easy enough to navigate and don't notice a lag time when going through the menus. It seems to be really sturdy and looks nice and i never notice it in my pocket. It is so ridiculously thin!! Although some people think it looks really wide when you hold up their phone to it, theres usually about a 1cm difference in width and a 1/2 cm difference in height, hardly worth mentioning. its got a cool camera that takes good pictures and overall i really enjoy it, and at $75 i don't regret my purchase at all. If I had paid $200, $300 or $400 I wouldve been a bit bothered. If I couldve i wouldve given it a 3 1/2 stars since 3 starts is a bit low....",neutral

"I went from a first-generation Razr to this phone, so it was a definite upgrade for me. I don't know if I would buy it again unless it had a few more items for the same low price. But I love the color and QWERTY very much. Being an avid texter, that keyboard is great. I love the fact that you can put in a micro card and get your items without paying a data transfer fee (I refuse to pay $1.99 per image). Since no card or USB cord comes with the phone, I bought them here from independent sellers (unfortunately, the USB cord isn't recognized by my computer and the San-Disk card had a bad adapter, so I'm 0 for 2 with sellers here). The pictures are really promising but the video quality is just as bad as my Razr. The alarm has a mon-fri setting, weekends, daily, etc. Definitely nice. But the volume on the alarm is the same as the volume for calls and you can't change it just for the alarm. I have a loud volume while at work, but that same volume sounds like a nuclear weapon when you're asleep at 6am. And on that subject, there is no ""quiet"" ring. It goes from loud to vibrate, to off. Since when does the lowest setting still mean ""loud""? The book included is practically useless. I still cannot figure out how to answer call-waiting without hanging up on both people. The little symbols on the screen have no definitions, so I have no idea what they all mean. It could be telling me I'm on hold with Pakistan and I'd never know. After hating on the book, I realized that what ISN'T in there is stuff you CAN'T do (novel concept) like changing the time. WHY? Why can't I decide to program my phone 5 minutes fast, or exactly the time of my child's school bell? Irritating. I almost returned the phone for that exact reason. No speakerphone with the clamshell closed. And the speaker will stay on afterwards unless you manually turn it off- closing the clamshell doesn't turn it off. It is easier to make a peanut butter sandwich while driving than to make a hands-free call at the wheel. I haven't found the shortcuts to calling someone while the clamshell is open (see ""useless book"" above), so I use the voice command. That little feature does work well. So on that note, USING SPEAKERPHONE WHILE DRIVING. Since this is apparently not only my bane, but others too, here's what I do: push the CLR/microphone button on the keypad (you can hear the voice command with the clamshell closed), tell it whom to call, and then after a second or so, open the clamshell. I'm sure there must be a better way, but the book... well, you know. The keypad lock is very poor. You need to push the OK button to unlock the phone, but this button is in the center of the keypad and the same height as all the others. My dog laid on the phone one day and managed to call people. I'm afraid to put it in my purse or back pocket lest it call Pakistan without me knowing it. I didn't have to enter a password when calling my voicemail with my Razr, so having to do it now stinks. You have to press # after the password, which requires more than a few keystrokes with the clamshell open. So checking voicemail via speakerphone is terrible. I think LG wants to get all people hands-free whether they like it or not. Whomever positioned the camera lens where it is needs to go back to school. My finger is in so many pictures I feel like a painter. But the camera does come with different settings that are very nice (the nighttime setting made a huge difference on some of my photos). I pretty much wanted a QWERTY and good picture quality. I got both of those. The sound quality is good, so overall I like it ok. However I will be changing it to something else once my contract expires.",neutral
"Maybe the sound quality is superior to other headsets, but it was so difficult to get to fit comfortably and properly that I gave up and returned it to Amazon. I paid $75 when it was on sale, but that's still a lot of money for a headset. It always felt like it was going to fall off, and underneath what looks like a slim body is a big lump where I guess all the electronics are. The buttons were difficult to find and operate when in place. If you look at the earloop in the picture, the outside is metal ,about the weight of a heavy paperclip, and the part that appears black is actually soft rubber stretched inside the 'paperclip' frame. Kinda hard to describe better than that. I don't remember but I think you get 4 sets of very similar earloops, two for each side, depending on which ear you use. And I think 3 sets of earpieces, also quite similar, and none that fit my ear snugly. If you can make it fit on your ear, the sound quality really was quite good. But if you can't get a good fit, it doesn't really matter how good the sound is. I kind of felt like I had to walk around with my head tilted to balance this thing on my ear. It never felt secure. Obviously if I returned it, it was not a satisfying purchase. Luckily, because of Amazon's generous return policy, they refunded all my money, including shipping costs since it was 'incompatible' with my ear.",neutral

"I received this speaker as a gift, and was very excited to try it out. The main purpose behind the gift was so that I could stream my music and movies/TV shows from the internet (ie: Pandora and NetFlix) to the speaker. When we set it up, we immediately realized that there was a problem. The speaker kept cutting out even though the song (or movie) was still streaming online (you could see the progress indicator still moving). After a few minutes of cutting sound cutting out, the internet would then freeze. With the internet frozen, the music, or movie, was stalled. The only thing that worked to fix the problem was to turn off the bluetooth and reset the internet. I learned, after some research online, that this was likely a problem relating to a single frequency router I had (2.4GHz). Both my internet and the bluetooth were running on the same 2.4GHz frequency, this causing interference and dropping both the bluetooth and ultimately the internet connection. I decided I liked the idea of the speaker enough to purchase a refurbished dual band router (2.4GHz and 5.0GHz), so to dedicate my internet to the 5.0GHz and the speaker's bluetooth to the 2.4GHz (the speaker only operates at the 2.4 GHz frequency). While it is better, it does still experience occasional cutting out of the sound and internet problems (though the internet does not ""stop"" anymore). I find it largely depends on where I am physically located in the room, and/or where my computer is in relation to the speaker. I should note that this doesn't happen when I play songs straight from my computer hard-drive. When I contacted Soundtooth to inquire about this problem, they ""Thank you for your reply. Sorry for the inconvenience. Please contact your retailer for after-sales service. If any problem occur with them, Please contact us again informing where you bought it."" I find that to be an unacceptable answer. They made no attempt to troubleshoot. I will say, when it works- it does it's job very well.

It works GREAT... however, if you are small (I am only 5' and female) and you don't have ears too big for your head, it might be uncomfortable. It is the ear hooks that are too big. The buds are great, they come in all the sizes. The hooks, even though they come in 2 sizes (standard and large), are still to big. My friend bought these things called ear bugs, you don't need a ear hook with them. They work great for her, but they don't stay in my ear canal. Still worth the sound quality though IMO.",positive

"Hey I can't help my opinion. I own this phone and it's not as great as these overly exicted people say! It's a good phone to start off with but TRUTHFULLY there are better phones... Like the Motorola V330. That's a better phone altogether. This phone's speaker phone does suck. It's ringer volume is Mediocre, Sprint and Nextel have a louder choice of phones. It's very small the same exact size of the V180, and there's nothing but an ugly poorly made leather pouch to put the little thing in. It's a beautiful phone to look at. But once you put it in the pouch (I bought from the T-Mobile store)it's no longer good looking... The menu is a bit confusing at first, but the battery life is good, picture quality is good, reception is good (no dropped calls). But I must say that sometimes it's hard to hear someone on the other line. Not that they're breaking up, it's just too low sometimes. The vibration option is weak and the graphics and ringers that come with the phone are also weak. The games are ok. Anyway you decide! Have fun!",neutral

"I first purchased this headset after reading decent reviews here and other places on line. I thought that for the price, I would receive a decent working Plantronics Headset. ****Boy was I wrong.**** I have had this headset for over 2 months now and haven't been that impressed with it. People on the other end of the line can hear me just fine, but even when I use it with my phone (Motorola E815) on the same side of my body (2-3 feet distance), I hear the worst static. Range on this puppy is decent at 10-15 feet, but outside of that, forget it. It is good that other people can hear me clear, but it doesn't do *ME* any good if every other word that is spoken to me is full of static in the reception. I have a very cheap headset (Jabra BT130) that works better than this one. I just ordered the Plantronics Voyager 510, and am hoping that this headset will be better than the Explorer 320. Honestly, I don't think that *ANY* other BT headset could be worse than the Explorer 320. I am anxiously awaiting the arrival of the Plantronics Voyager 510.",negative

"I got this product in the mail quickly and charged it up. With a computer it charges fairly slow, but in an wall outlet it's pretty quick. I used it when my phone was at 4%, and it took it to 100% in about an hour or so. Pretty good, seeing as my regular wall charger will charge it in the same about of time. I received the wireless charger and two cords, one for the charger to be charged and one to charge your phone through the charger, so I was happy that I got everything. Not only did I use it to charge my phone, but after that was finished, I charged my tablet up to 100%. To my surprise the wireless charger still had 2 bars left, and I used that a few days later when my phone started to die in the car. Mind you, if you use your phone while the wireless charger is charging it, it will charge slower. That's a given, it happens with wall chargers too. If you set your phone down and let the wireless charger do it's job you won't be upset with the results at all. I go out and about quite a lot so this charger has been a life saver.",positive

"I've used my fair share of bluetooth headsets. Infact before i ordered the H721, I'd already ordered another one, which was returned unopened immediately after i had read the reviews on this one. This headset binds with 2 phones simultaneously. will handle calls from either phone very smoothly and redials the last number dialed using whichever cell was used last. I have realized that the phone that you pair 'second' with this headset is the primary unit. In case you walk away from you cell and it loses the bt connection, getting it to pair again would be more tedious if you paired your primary cell first. However, if you pair it second, all you need to do is to press the call button and bingo! instant reconnection, without going into painful phone menus. My iPhone works amazingly with it. This bt is a sure keeper. great voice quality and most of all nothing painfully sticking inside my ear. you won't even know its there. the voice is so loud, i have to keep it as low as 20-25%. i would recommend this unit to without hesitation.",positive

"....but not at first. When I received my meter and started working with it I realized that it was out of calibration. (The instructions tell you how to check.) I called the manufacturer and they said that either the (included) battery was run down or it was a defective meter. They offered to replace it immediately, but I opted to try battery replacement first, which didn't work. The next day the manufacturer sent me a new meter via Priority Mail, and included a stamped, self-addressed box with which to return the defective one. Such a pleasure to do business with these people, especially since the same Amazon shipment included a defective Panasonic phone which I'm having to return at my own expense, and only after they receive it will they send me a refurbished phone in exchange, and in the meantime I'm not able to fax out or receive messages. And the meter is great. The Hazard Thresholds marked in red on the readout agree with the research I've previously done on the subject. It's the perfect instrument for household/consumer (as opposed to professional) use, and it's a very reasonable price for the level and kinds of fields it measures. I'm glad I got it--I've been reassured about many potential sources of dangerous EMFs in my environment, and thoroughly alarmed about the magnetic fields emanating from the florescent lighting in my kitchen and my husband's shop. Highly recommended to anyone concerned about electromagnetic fields in their environment. Which, IMO, should be everyone.",positive

However it does haze up your screen a bit even in dark areas, which I don't mind but the main draw back is that it gives your screen a colorful appearance much like that of a TV that has had a magnet get a little to close to it. I wouldn't say full on magnet to screen but a definite ""rainbow"" effect. It also does not seem to be the static kind of SP that is capable of being removed and reinstalled as stated in the product description. The product was in pretty good condition upon arrival but did have a few flaws that are noticeable with the naked eye. Also the shipping took a bit long, taking 10 days to arrive.

This looks and works beautifully in my Impala. It includes screws and velcro depending on how permanent you want it. I went ahead and put it in the right way.

"I upgraded from the Treo 600 and let me tell you, this is a BIG upgrade. If you have the 650, it may or may not be worth it, but if you don't yet have one of these devices or have a 600, I would give it a strong recommendation. Negatives: 1. I have installed the software on my laptop and desktop and have tried everything under the sun to successfully sync the device to no avail. There are NO customer service numbers, only internet help sessions. I have tried every single thing under the internet sessions and have still yet to successfully sync. I am currently frustrated beyond belief because I love the phone, but I can't sync all of my previous data to it. If any of you have any advice, please let me know! 2. It's the same size as the 600 and 650. It would have been nice to see a progression to a smaller device. 3. The Windows interface is different than the Palm and if you are a Palm OS lover, this device is not for you. Postives- 1. I actually like the Windows interface slightly better. 2. The ability to sync Word and Excel is huge. 3. The almost broadband internet access is the real deal. It's not quite that fast, but pretty darn fast for checking web based email on the go or looking something up real quick. 4. The sound on of the person you are talking to is much better than the 600 and probably equivalent to the 650 from what I hear. 5. The camera is a nice 1.3 megapixel and takes decent pictures, but has no flash or zoom. The pictures are pretty good for a phone, however. 6. The TODAY screen is nice and the ability to have your speed dials with their picture on that screen is a nice touch. Overall, this phone would get a 4/5 if I were able to get it to sync easily. The fact that I have probably spent 12 hours of effort is exhausting, disappointing and completely frustrating because I still have no solution in sight. If, however, you are able to get accomplish this task with ease, have a 600 or are looking at this vs. the 650, I would say go for it. The interface is user friendly, pleasant and refined. This phone will do it all for you...and then some.",neutral
"Overall this thing is pretty good, but I thought I'd make note of something I haven't seen mentioned in the other reviews: When I look through the screen protector while wearing any kind of polarized sunglasses, it creates a dark brown/rainbow pattern that makes it very hard to read the screen. I guess this is because the plastic of the screen protector is not really that smooth. Without sunglasses, it looks fine. In any case, if you're planning on using this in the car or outdoors and you wear sunglasses, you might want to be aware of this.",neutral
"I bought this for my Treo 700p. When new, it looks reasonable. The material is worn down in some areas after 3 months of use. I didn't need the pocket inside for memory cards but the button has scratched my Treo right on the Treo logo. It is disappointing to buy a device for hundreds of dollars then to have a cheap case scratch it. I flipped my phone around in the case so it is now scratching the back. The belt clip is a sturdy and strong pinching type clip. It does not clip around a belt but it has not popped off of my belt yet. The strong pinching type has scratched my belts (since pinches so firmly) and has pulled apart the material of one belt. I prefer clips that reach around a belt to clip and hold the pouch in place. I will probably look for a better case for my Treo. Overall I can't recommend this case. Unfortunately most cases are poorly made and break easily. My search will not be easy.",neutral

The swivel clip is very slim and holds position better than most. And best of all, I no longer have to lock the keyboard because the sleep functions work beautifully.

"Users have 2 choices; buy the original Moto version for about $12-15 each, or a clone for as low at $1-3. In prior phones I've used with similar side snap-on belt clips, the 'clones', whose manufacturer is unknown except it isn't brand-named with Moto and comes with no warranty, has lasted me 4-6mo before its clip breaks off, less commonly it lasts longer. The Moto one is guaranteed for a year, and it literally lasts 12-18mo before it too breaks. Doing the math, the Moto version will run the user 0.67-1.00 a month. The clones $0.16-0.75 a month. The clone's value depends on how much you buy it for. This $6 version, which if not guaranteed, will not be a good value if it breaks within 6 months. Don't forget shipping and handling. I buy these clips from OEM for $1 a piece in lots of 30. Why a clip versus a belt case? Dust free and small profile other than pocketing the phone. My friends who use a phone case phone in it end up getting dust inside the LCD screen. The case itself get very ratty looking as it ages, and the threads wear off before the clip breaks. In the snap clip, the phone 'breathes' and stays clean. However, if you are in a rough job site, where the phones can snapped out of your holster and dropped, it may pay to get something more secure and bulky. Further, the phone can also be bumped and scratched if it's very exposed. The holster is best if you wear a jacket or coat continuously. This protects the phone yet makes it easy to access on your hip. The belt clip mount is ideal for those who prefer the phone vibrate rather than ring. The phone snaps into the holster, and pushing the top snap releases the phone quickly. The rotating version allows the user to angle the phone from 0-180 in 20 degrees clicks, so it can be mounted on either the left or right hip angled the same way. This rotation feature is the clips weakness, this is the site that breaks. There is a non-rotating clip that should last longer, since the clip is built into the case as one piece. Only if the plastic fatigues from overuse will it eventually break. Alas, with the phone sitting upright, the antennae occassionally pokes you in the side. If this clip were made of aluminum rather than plastic it would be worth $15-20 and last longer. Alas, both the original Moto and OEMs are not durable, and its just a question of bad to worst when it comes to durability.",neutral
"Overall, the product performs flawlessly. The voice is clear, the microphone sensitive and the noise cancellation seems to be very effective. My only constraint with this product is the visor clip. For most vehicles, I'm sure this device will mount without issue. I tried mounting it on a Toyota 4-Runner and the visor clip was not wide enough to fit on the visor. Even stretching the clip, didn't work. The vendor stated they didn't have an alternative visor clip.",neutral
"I purchased this phone just over a year ago and I have to say that it has served me well. Verizon's network is extremely reliable. I can't remember the number of times I've had service when friends of mine with other providers did not and they had to use my phone to make calls. The pics aren't great quality, but that's what I own a camera for. To take spur of the moment pics to send friends, its fine. As far as the bluetooth issue goes, it hasn't bothered me any because I don't have a need for it, but its something to consider. The one complaint I do have, and I'm beginning to think this is a general motorola problem (especially after reading some of the other reviews), is the battery. This is the second motorola I've purchased that after about 8 months to a year, the battery loses charge after only a few hours even if the phone isn't in use. I'm not sure if the problem lies in the battery or in the connection for the charger because I do notice sometimes my phone is plugged in and not actually charging. I still prefer motorolas over other brands available because of the style and text messaging options, but I would highly recommend purchasing the insurance for 5 bucks a month just in case. (Unless you purchase the phone for less than the 50 dollar deductible).",neutral
"I am a Cingular Blue customer, i.e. former AT&T customer rolled into Cingular billing, but with my old AT&T sim card. I bought this phone a couple weeks ago. The phone did not work out of the box with my AT&T sim card, it kept booting to a screen that asked for a password. That was a bummer, as I really wanted to keep my great AT&T calling plan. So, after a little research, I found a non-branded cell phone store (privately owned, not T-Mobile, Cingular, etc.) where they did instant unlocking for a very reasonable fee (around twenty bucks). That did it! After 5 minutes and pocket change, my phone was unlocked and worked with my AT&T sim card. And, now I can put *any* sim card in the phone, not just Cingular/AT&T. So, for example, any European or American pay-as-you-go sim will work. Very cool. As for the phone itself - I love it. I have been using cell phones since the early 90's, when minutes were measured in dollars, and this phone is the *best* phone I've had. Great size, great features, great reception. Bluetooth. Speakerphone. Highly customizable interface. MP3 ringtones. Compact. Huge, bright color screen inside, and nice color screen outside. One of the easiest to open foldable phones. For example, the seam between the two halves lets you slip a finger in to flip the phone open quite easily. I loved my old V60 years ago, but my main complaint about that was you *had* to use two hands to open it. When it was closed it was too smooth to flip open with one hand. The Razr allows one handed flip - very cool. Don't worry about the battery life warnings. My phone easily goes a couple days with regular use, and many days with just a little use. I mean, I suppose charging once every two weeks would be fun, but practically speaking just plugging it in every couple days without thinking about it works fine for me. My only real complaint is there is no headphone jack! The *only* port is a little mini-USB type B port, which is for charging, data transfer, and headphone plug. But no standard 2.5 mm plug. Of course, it has bluetooth, so any bluetooth headset will work. In fact, I use the Jabra 250v and love it. It works really well. But sometimes I like the simplicity of a *wired* headset, without having to worry about batteries, and that's the only area where the Razr stumbles. I have yet to find any way to adapt a standard 2.5 mm plug to the mini USB plug on the phone. And the only headset available with a mini USB plug built in is Motorola's, and they only offer one, which is the little dangley earpiece kind with a dongle on the wire for the mic. I really don't like those. CONCLUSION: Love the phone. Love the features. Love the reception. Would like a headphone plug.",positive
"I bought a second one of these within the first year because I managed to snap off the clip with too much pressure on it from sitting bended in the car. Still - I bought another because I believe for the price, this is a great holster. Love it. I even have a skin on my BB and it fits nicely in this holster. The second unit had slightly different ""quality"" in that it seemed slightly less polished and the spin on the clip is a bit rough - but again - for the price - I'm OK with it and am happy again.",positive
"I upgraded to this Nokia 6102 phone after my other Nokia fell in a toilet on accident (which is a little intact but kept dying on me randomly). I always hated flip phones because they are easy to break and snap in half if you accidentally drop it with the lid popped up. I used to have a Samsung flip phone and after time the lid become lose and eventually broke. This Nokia phone, however, has only been with me for a month and the antenna black piece popped off. It looks like it was held on my glue (NO SCREWS!!). The quality of it is not as good as I thought it would be. When I flip open the phone the joints that open the phone seem lose and it has only been a month. Also, the basic speaker is not great--I have a hard time hearing someone in the car or when there's a little noise around. The speakerphone is actually more powerful than the normal speaker! I am definitely going back to a Nokia 3595...This is a great basic phone and you don't have to worry about it breaking! Cingular has offered to replace it and send me a new Nokia 6102, but I refuse to own another. To summarize everything: PROS: -Camera (don't care for one since I have a new camera that takes better quality pics than cameraphones) -Speakerphone (loud and clear, more convienent when driving! -easy to read screen -double-screened -good battery life -Easy to handle (not too small, not to bulky) -Radio (can't use unless I buy headphones though) -Video (never really use it, don't care to have it) -Voice recording (you can make your own ring tones from it if you want) CONS: -Volume level is too LOW on the basic speaker -Not enough default themes/backgrounds to choose from. Older phones had more choices. -When scrolling through Contact List, or anything in that matter, it seems delayed no matter how quickly you press buttons. -ANTENNA PIECE IS A MAJOR DEFECT IN PHONE! It falls off after gentle use (never dropped) I generally don't have good experiences with flip phones, which is why I am going back to a basic one without all those unneccessary features. Plus they're more durable, reliable, and better quality for the price. -",neutral

Somehow the interaction between the charger and the tip is faulty, and just stops working. Annoying!!! Now I have to bring yet another charger on tips.",negative
"If you had asked me 3 months ago, I would've rated this 5 stars. However, in the last month the device doesn't charge. I've had it look like it was charging with the lights going but then no actual charge. Or it just doesn't do anything no matter what charger I plug it into. This is really disappointing because I only bought it 5 months ago. Prior to that, it had been working great. I could easily get 2.5 full charges of my iPhone 5. It was perfect for travel. I could use it all day, charge it overnight and it was ready to go again the next day.",neutral
"This phone arrived and I fully charged the battery, this only gave me one day worth of battery life. I tried again with the same results, one day or less of battery life and sometimes the phone just shuts down when the battery is near the end. This MAY be because the phone has been in stock super long and the battery is ancient, (date stamped from 2009 or so) OR it could be that it is not a genuine Motorola product. Also the phone is more plasticky than I am used too with prior Motorola Razors. (Prior models maybe?) But this also makes me wonder if this is a legit Motorola product or some knock off. Adding to this impression is the fact that some of the little plastic/rubber screw covers came off within a day or two of purchase and the limited documentation that arrived with the phone. All of this adds up to a phone I cannot use and cannot return because I threw away the packaging. I am not at all happy with this product.",negative
"I'll be honest, I was a bit apprehensive at first about getting one of these things. Now I don't see how I ever went without it. I bought my sidekick two weeks ago today and I just love it. Yes, it is pricey but well worth it. Since I already had a contract with Verizon I only got the sidekick for data. I don't see what people are complaining about with this phone. Web browsing is what you'd expect. Pages load quicker on here than on my comp sometimes. But keep in my, it's a phone, not high speed dsl. I have used it as phone service a couple of times (just to test out coverage and reception in my area) and it's been great. A few deadspots in my house sometimes but still better than I expected. I live in the Richmond, VA area so T-mobile has excellent coverage here. Text messaging is soooo easy with my sidekick and AIM and AOL email are remarkably fast. It's the closest you can get to a mini-laptop on a phone. The only real complaints I have about this are minor to most but enough that drove me to give it only four stars: first, the camera. It's mediocre at best and sucky at worst. My camera on my LG vx-6000 is better. You have to get really close to the person or object you are taking a picture of in order for it to turn out decent. I need tips on how to work with the camera maybe. The other thing I hate is the lack of variety with the ringtones and games. There aren't nearly as many as Verizon has, but I'm hoping that this will improve. All in all, it's still worth the money. Verizon was robbing me blind with the amount of texting I was doing every month so I'm glad I have the sidekick for that. I am in the process of having my sidekick tricked out and I'm seriously contemplating having it studded (damn you Paris Hilton) because it's too cute looking and reflects my personality sooo much. I highly recommend buying a sidekick especially if you are an on the go person like me who does a lot of text messaging and emailing.",positive
Bought this for my not so tech savvy boss & It works like a charm. So far it has been fail proof for him...and that's saying ALOT!,positive
"Pros: + Compact + Clear voice + Full of accessories in box + Comfortable fit Cons: - Voice control doesn't work well in noisy environment - very susceptible to wind noise - Battery capacity - Doesn't remember LED light setting after power cycle - Button does not do standard calling functions while in voice control mode. - Hogging speed dial spots. I bought the V1 to upgrade from Jabra BT8010 because BT8010 doesn't stay in my ear well. V1 fits very well with the ear gel. Sound quality is pretty good, as good as listening to the cellphone directly. I tried the included Comply foam (model T-200, comes with two pieces), the sound becomes too loud and bassy for my taste. (I ended up using the Comply foams on Shure e2c stereo headphones. Works great.) But my biggest gripe is about the voice control. While driving, 50% of the time it doesn't pick up what I say correctly. It also hardcodes the first few speed dials of your phone to commands like ""call home"". So if you had set your phone's speed dial 2 to work, you still have to say ""call home"" to call work. Also, all my other bluetooth headphones in the past allows you to press and hold the button to do redial, but not the V1 in the default voice control mode. It gets a little awkward when others can hear you dialing with the headset - all of a sudden they hear you say something like ""redial"". And to end a call, you have to double click instead of a single click (which controls the digital noise filter). The V1 is weak against wind noise. while walking in a light breeze, me and the person on the other ends of the phone were hearing a lot of noises. The two digital filter settings doesn't seem to matter much. My old BT8010 usually lasts 2~3 days before recharge, but I have to recharge V1 every other day. One last thing, the blue LED light flashes every now and then, which can get a little annoying in the dark. You can turn it off in the settings menu, but power cycling always resets it back on.",neutral

"I purchased this to have a backup charger at work for my Palm Pre. I didn't want the additional expense of a second touchstone. This product works very well. I have been using this cable for a few days plugged into a USB port without any issues. I have used it for all 3 options-- Media Sync, USB Drive, and Just Charge, all worked fine. I have read a number of reviews for various cables that don't work with the Touchstone; I plugged this one in to the Touchstone and it worked fine. I believe part of the issue on those is that the mini USB cable end isn't long enough to fit in the Touchstone, but I did not have any problems connecting this specific cable. If you are buying this to use with a Touchstone, keep in mind that you will need to purchase a USB outlet adapter, as well. (The touchstone won't work with the cable plugged into a USB port; it must be plugged into an outlet.) Pros: good price, works well, works with the Touchstone, performs all required tasks Cons: a bit short (about 40 inches/1 meter long); if using with a Touchstone you must also purchase the USB outlet adapter.",positive

"This charger is great as an extension to a single outlet cigarette lighter. The USB ports are very useful particularly the 2 amp one for iPads and other tablets with higher current requirements. My problem is that is appears to generate radio frequency (RF) 'noise' that makes it very difficult for my 2003 BMW 530i factory radio to pull in weak signals. I used this recently on a ski trip in Vermont and radio reception was terrible as soon as I plugged this into the cigarette lighter outlet. If I disconnected it, radio reception returned to normal. There must be a switching voltage regulator in this for the USB ports that is not well shielded and is 'transmitting' RF garbage that screws up radio reception. I should add that my BMW has the antenna embedded in the rear windshield. It is possible that this charger will not interfere with antennas mounted outside the car on a fender or roof. It is a shame because it is a great charger with extra outlets.",negative

The sewing of the belt loop is weak however, and I ripped the thing off my belt getting out of my car. I resewed it by hand to make the repair, but I redid the top seam too because the stitching from the manufacturer was also pulling loose and is only just adequate instead of being stronger than necessary. I guess that means it's inadequate. I think they should make the sewing better, and I'd like the ability to remove the metal clip which I don't need and just gets in the way.",neutral
I have bought three of these and within a few days the metal clip starts to tear away from the holster. It may be due to the phone having an otterbox cover. It would probably be ok if the phone does not have a cover and slides in and out easily.,negative
"No doubt Jabra is the best selling bluetooth headset these days, and for sure it's not the best bluetooth headset on the market, but have to give credit to their marketing department which is doing a good job in promoting this headset. I used to own this Jabra headset, my first impression of this headset is big and it's too obvious on the ear. Amazingly it wasn't heavy and that's good. The headset did a good job in pairing to my phone, it sounded fine, but the range is quite bad, I can't walk to far away from the phone even it said 10 meters range. I was just 2 meters away, the sound quality droped significanly. The battery life was also a problem, have to charge whenever I got a chance. Recently I found a good headset, STEP 1150, which is little known and made by a company called STEP Communications. It got a good review from PC World magazine. (...) It's a small profile headset, all day wearing comfort and long battery life. I highly recommend it.",neutral
"I had a 4 port USB hub (also powered) from DLINK. However, that hub would always turn off when the computer was turned off. It wouldn't charge my devices when the computer was off. Also I had a growing list of USB charging/syncing devices. The devices that are being used to sync/charge are: Amazon Kindle 2 Charge/Sync USB 2xAA Battery Charger Bluetooth Headset(BlueAnt) Charger Vado HD Charger/Sync BlackBerry Tour Charger/Sync iPod Shuffle Charger/Sync All 6 items charge/sync completely. They also all charge even when the computer is off. Which was the most important thing I was looking for. Some of the reviews on this site is conflicting because some people say it doesn't charge when the computer is off. That is not true. It does charge your devices even when the computer is off. I haven't had a chance to test transfer speeds, but I can guess it will be like any other USB 2.0 hubs out there. This hub is extremely small, even compared to my original 4 port USB hub. I was surprised it used a mini USB port to USB to connect from the hub to the computer. The 7 port hub manual also states that it has 500 mA for EACH PORT. Which is enough to charge most USB devices. All my devices charged at a normal rate. Although, my Blackberry Tour was being charged a bit slow compared to a dedicated power adapter (but this was expected...). This isn't a problem for me because I wanted something to charge my devices over night. It cut down a lot of charging adapters for me. Also, I feel it's more green because I can have all 6 devices plugged in and if I'm not using it, I can just unplug the adapter for the USB hub cutting all the power to the devices. The 7 port hub was tested with a MacBook Pro (Early 2008) running Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard. Hope this helps!",positive

"I was a little surprised to see that the average review is about 3 stars. I was expecting better scores. I think it's a decent phone, just lacking some modern features. There's no MP3 player, no camera (most cell phone cameras are pretty bad anyway), and there's no speakerphone (though it's a bluetooth phone, so I wouldn't use that anyway, I don't get it). Voice quality over the phone is very good, about on the same level as my old Kyocera K9, which I'm told is one of the best sounding phones. Ringtones are loud enough that I can actually hear them. It is a decent-looking phone, although a bit boring for some, I guess. It has held up well, and is still 100% functional even after being dropped a few times, and having been bumped into things all the time. Service? I've kept my Virgin Mobile service for a few years now. I don't use my phone all that much, so the $15/90 days I believe is still the cheapest available, and it works great for me. I do lose reception in steel buildings, but they all do that. I've never had a dropped call, or missed a call due to not having a signal. I wish the phone had more notepad memory. After you have 10 or 15 notes, it won't let you create any more, even if there's lots of memory left on the phone. I don't like any of the ringtones or text-tones that come loaded in the phone, and the games loaded on the phone are only trial versions. So it cost me $13, I think, to download a ringtone I like, and add a couple games to keep me occupied if get stuck waiting. I was actually shopping to replace the Flare, but it sounds like the X-TC is too limited, and the other phones are mostly the same, except that some have cameras. I'll just stick with what I have for a while longer. UPDATE, 7/22/12: I'm not sure what's going on, but the phone started to drain the battery within 16 hours about a month ago.

I don't have the instructions any more and admittedly some of my problems may be user error, but I know only one of four charge indicator lights illuminate after charging all night (originally all four would light).

I will NEVER GO WITH NEXTEL again, even Cingular was better than this. In conclusion NEXTEL SERVICE BAD MOTOROLA OK",neutral

"I wanted to like this headset, but it had so many problems that I returned it within a day. I opted for a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Plantronics-Voyager-855-Bluetooth-Headset-Black/dp/B000UBNFT2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Plantronics Voyager 855 Bluetooth Headset (Black)</a>&nbsp;instead and it has proven much more practical and capable. Let's start with why it is impractical. It hangs around your neck, with the control pod down on your chest. Needless to say, you look like a goon if you wear it outside of your shirt and it is very comfortable inside of your shirt. If you wear a jacket or sweatshirt it shouldn't be a problem. Extra impractical if you're running. The actual headphones are not replaceable (though they are on other, cheaper Sony headsets). The wires are also not braided. Guess what's going to happen? Yes, your wires will fray naturally or be chewed on by a pet within a month and your $100 headset goes in the trash. Compare to the Voyager 855, which has a braided cord on its optional (and replaceable) headphone, and only costs around 30 bucks. Which brings me to the price. Did I mention it was $100 for a product unlikely to last more than a few months unless treated with zealous care? If I'm going to need to replace my headphones every month, I'll stick with my cheapos, thank you very much. The UI is maddening. It can connect to multiple devices, but to do so you must hold the menu button, navigate to the devices menu, the select a device. You do all this on a control pod whose buttons seem to have been designed to give you hand cramps. The control pod itself is larger than most headsets, and even larger than some media players. My second MAJOR problem is connectivity. I tried connecting it to two products: an iPod Touch 2g and a Sony Ericsson Walkman W580i phone. The iPod touch supports the fancy Bluetooth profiles that let you listen in stereo and control your music playback, while the phone doesn't. The initial pairing on either product took an extremely long time and multiple attempts. Nine out of ten times it would time out and give up trying to pair. I followed all instructions meticulously and placed the devices at varying distances from the control pod. If getting it to pair was a matter of trial and error, getting it to connect was like winning the lottery. There was no rhyme or reason to how it decided to connect to my devices. I would press connect on my phone or iPod and wait. It would try to connect, then give up and say 'Not Connected'. I would then repeat this about ten times. Eventually, if I was lucky, I'd get a connection. That connection would work for about one minute before it spontaneously disconnected. I can't tell you anything about this product's sound quality or battery life because I couldn't keep it connected long enough to make a call or start a song. The worst part of this is that I was using a Sony Ericsson phone! Even worse, I was at least able to get the iPod to connect for about a minute, if only once or twice. The phone never actually connected after it was paired. The same phone connects flawlessly and automatically with both a Garmin Nuvi GPS device and the Plantronics Voyager 855, as does the iPod. I do not recommend this product to anyone. Even if you have no problems connecting the headset, it is still an impractical and expensive headset that will be a pain to use for the month you own it before a wire frays and you have to throw it away. Buy the Plantronics Voyager 855 instead.",negative
"I got this in hopes of finding a way to take my iPhone4 on runs and hikes to use the phone's MP3 and GPS functionalities on such activities. But the case is too tight and it makes songs skip.

I bought this to charge my Droid Razr Maxx. I followed the instructions and had a full charge on the item before I left on a bicycle tour. I charged my phone with this on the first night. The iTorch did charge my phone but from 30% to 50% full and the iTorch was empty. I don't know if the Razr Maxx was too much for it or what but it certainly did not live up to my expectations. I wanted to be able to charge my phone from zero to 100% once but I only got 20% out of it. In my opinion the iTorch isn't worth it if you are looking to charge a Droid Razr. It sounds like others have had better results so this could be limited to this particular brand of phone.,negative
"What ever you do, DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!!! From a Long Time PALM User Let me first start by saying that I am a loyal Palm-Handspring-PalmOne-Palm user. I have owned the folowing; Palm IIIe, Palm Vx, HandSpring Visor, Handspring Visor Delux, VisorPhone (a Handspring Phone Add on), Treo 270, Treo 600, Treo 650, and am now the SAD owner of two completly useless Treo 700w's. I really was loving my GSM treo 650, but my wife wanted to upgarde to a Smartphone and was on Verizon, so that coupled with the lure of the high speed internet led to the worst $1000 purchase of our lives. It is unfortunate for Verizon and Palm that I bought two of these and was able to see that all of the crashes and problems that I was having were not isolated to my phone, becuase my wife's was doing the same exact things. It is one thing if you run into some bugs with the more advanced applications, but when you are locked into a two year contract for PHONE service, then PHONE part better at least work. On the Treo 700w it does not. Here are some of the problems with JUST the phone application in the device, I will not even need to mention the more advanced issues. 1)Horrible call quality 2)Constant dropped calls 3)Often, the phone can not swap between calls without disconnecting. 4)Can not hang up on second caller (so you have two calls going on and on and on, which I am sure verizon is charging you for those mins). 4) Phone randomly dialing calls when it is sitting uninterupted on the desk in front of you 5)Phone calls your voicemail when you dial another person. 6)Bluetooth headset disconnects EVERYTIME you walk more than 50 feet away and only a 5-10 min series of soft resets and resyncing can get them to connect again. 7)Phone rings and the ansewer screen will not come up, so you can not ansewer the call. 8)Voicemails apearing 10 mins after someone called with no indication of call arriving prior to that 9) Worst of all. The phone will somtimes appear to be working normally and I will go for an entire day without a call. Then late in the day I will try to check my email or make a call and neither will work. I do a reset and then the horror kicks in. Bing, Bing, Bing, Bing, you have 24 voicemails and 8 text messages....WHERE ARE YOU! All of our old phones rang when someone called and allowed you to ansewer and hang up on people. Is this too much to ask? In genreal I would have to say that the operating system on this phone is in ALPHA phase. It is nowhere near ready for the public market that it has found it's way too. I could also go on and on about the horror of trying to get PALM and VERIZON to own up to this fact and give me a different phone...ANY Phone. I asked for a refurbished 1999 Audiovox, because at least I know I can make and recive calls. They will not even do that for me. Because of my positve history with the PALM operating system, I am still going to give PALM one more chance, but I am going back to the PALM operating system with the TREO 680. What ever you do, DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!!!",negative
The phone is good overall for the price. The only feature I don't like about it is the message typing. It gives you options for words every time you type a letter and then wants you to choose the letter you like. This ends up taking so much of my time typing up even a very short message.,neutral

"One of the first reviews for the New Motorola Motorokr S9-HD Bluetooth stereo headset. I will be occasionally comparing this to the original and current S9 (which is extremely successful for Motorola. I am using this on the HTC touch and HP Pavilion notebook Hardware Construction. Solid 9/10 Really well made and light about (even lighter than the original S9) many subtle improvements:- Much more comfortable Extremely rugged New finger friendly controls A ribbed rubberized inner section to stop sliding New ear plugs that are just great (also it comes with a selection well done Motorola) Improved microphone ( I found the S9 not really usable outdoors people complained too much about the background noise and couldn't hear me not one complaint on the new unit. (it even came with adaptor for the Iphone). Reception/Signal. Excellent 9/10. I found the strength of this far superior to the old unit and does work approx 30 feet away still get the occasional `breaking up' but very rare once again vastly improved over the S9 Sound clarity 10/10. lus now conversations are through both speakers .This is what its all about! Truly incredible, I thought the S9 was good but wait till you listen. Almost as good as my top of the range wired Sure headphones (Seriously AMAZING, and I am a sound geek ) .it even has 2 sound settings plus noise cancellation. Controls 8/10. You really have to read the manual for this to max its features but easy thereafter.

"Pros: It's beautiful. It's compact. It's sturdy. It works well as a phone. Reception is good. Voice-dialing works great. I can check my gmail at a click of a button. I can look up my google calendar the same way. (After simple programming) MP3 player works well. The sounds are great. I like multimedia aspect of the phone, too. ""Flipping"" can be annoying, but considering that it is not a PDA phone but works just as well, it is a minor inconvenience that one can easily put up with. Takes decent pictures. If you are a thoughtful photographer, you can end up with some frame-able shots. Video quality is not all that great, but I like it that it automatically creates a quick time file that I can easily send to both Mac and PC users and they have no problem downloading and viewing them. After all, no one really intends on shooting an award winning film with phone camcorder, right? Cons: MP3 Player song list is not as intuitive as iPod. If you have 500 songs and the song you want to listen to is song number 400, you have to go from the top all the way to 400. Get the picture? Flipping can be annoying, but as mentioned above, you can get used to it. There is a big learning curve on understanding all the functions and characteristics of the phone. You start out excited, because the phone is beautiful and seems promising. Then you get frustrated very fast by the ""sensitivity"" of the multimedia buttons and the constant flipping. And then you fall in love with it all over again as you get used to the phone, because it has a lot to offer. Love hate. Comes only with 64meg memory. Good thing is that you can expand it by getting a 1 gig or even 2 gig memory card. I have 2 gigs and I love it. The extended battery is good to have, but sometimes it's cumbersome to carry your phone in it. It's a beautiful phone, wouldn't you want to show it off? But the extended battery does come handy at times, so it's like, you want it and then you don't want it. You debate where to put the extended battery if you take your phone off it. Bottom line: I wanted to return this phone many times. It's been 3 weeks. I am still debating. It has a lot of good things to offer, but it also has its quirks and problems. If you want something that comes close to a PDA without the bulk, if you want something like an iPhone, but not yet ready to buy an iPhone like me, this is a good one to get. I most likely will keep it, but I know that it will be a constant love/hate thing. It sure is a beautiful gadget, though.",positive
"PROS - Much more compact, easier to carry and lighter than previous models like IMP500 which i also own - Faster charging than previous model IMP500 - I was able to get around 1.5 battery charge even while using my iPhone4S intermittently - Also used this on iPad3 and iPhone 5 and it worked fine with them. - It takes about 3 hours to charge the iTorch fully from almost zero charge when using a direct A/C plugin. CONS - It would be better if the torch and laser pointer switches were separate from the charging switch. A slider switch might work better. - The flashlight is not bright enough to be useful in most situations. In fact I would like the charger even if it came without the flashlight. - It would be nice to have an integrated charging cable for the battery so that there's no need to carry an extra cable just for charging the battery. - Prefer the spring loaded/retractable charger cable in the older IMP500 model to the charging cable for the itorch.",positive

"There is only one light on the product. Mine was either red or blinking red, except when I first connected the power cord - when it flashed green for 2 seconds. I called zBoost customer service and was told the light is green when it is receiving a good cell signal. The very brief ""manual"" in the product packaging does not even mention ""green light"". It just says that a red light is not good. Amazon's return policy is amazing so a replacement unit arrived in a couple days.

"I bought this hoping many of the stellar reviews would trump the many poor reviews, but unfortunately it turned out to not be the case for me. I ordered the item to be able to charge my new AT&T Inspire 4G, by HTC. It's a battery hog, so having a portable recharge would be great. I opened the box, and was really excited because the product is sexi to look at... it's not one of the dark black boxy electronics you usually associate with this type of product. It's curvy and nice looking. Initial read of the instructions proved to be a challenge, as it's clearly a manual that was written in Chinese and then translated and converted to english for North American sale. It was a bit contradictory and vague in a couple aspects, so I went online and watched the how-to, just so I could say with certainty I was using it properly. I charged it initially for 24 hours (it recommends 4-6 hours), and the instruction manual that came with it said one light will flash when it was completed charging. After 24 hours, TWO lights were still charging. I went onto their website and it states that when charging is complete, the light should remain on and solid. However this was not the case for me. I decided based on the specs, 24 hours should have been more than enough to charge it (by technological spec 5 hours from complete drain to full charge is all it should take). I plugged in my device, and immediately all 4 lights lit up on the battery pack indicating full capacity. After 5 minutes, it dropped to 3, then after 10 minutes it went to 2... At this point I contacted the manufacturer. They were quick to respond that it's likely defective. I questioned if they see this a lot and they said yes. I asked why they don't resolve it and they said (in broken english) that it was what people expect for half the price of the competition. Seems a bit odd of a response from them. To me I'd want to put out the best (usable) product for the price, or not put out a product, but hey, whatever. BOTTOM LINE: Amazon is issuing me a refund as I'm sending this one back. Normally I'd give the benefit of the doubt and re-order another one, but given the less than impressive response from the manufacturer, I'm planning on returning for a refund. I'm going to order the Zagg Sparq 2.0, which gets great reviews. At almost 2x the price, I'll have to suck it up and pay for it, but I suppose if I want a product that comes with warranty and support, that's the cost of it. I also learned that Amazon doesn't have a lot of flexibility in their marketplace seller practices, so they said their hands are tied. I'll stick to ordering direct from Amazon going forward. :-(",negative

"we purchased this cell phone to go with the pay-as-you-go, AT&T Go Phone Service. The black painted matte finish starting to tip slightly on the edge on one side. Because of this, I don't think the finish is very durable on the long run. If nothing else, the voice quality is fairly good to me. Initially, the battery doesn't seem to hold a charge for a long but gradually appear to improved with more charge cycles. The digital camera resolution is quite low but adequate for simple snapshots. Because of limited storage, the digital camera is probably useful in case of auto accidents or other uses. This phone has many other features that is not supported or optional with our service provider such as net access and IM as well as online gaming. Although I haven't tried it yet, it's supposed to also record videos. Like I said earlier, because of limited storage it would not be practical to use. This phone uses a miniature USB port like those on some Cannon digital camera. I've tried hooking this phone up to my computer using my digital camera patch cord to see what would happened. My computer wasn't able to do anything with it. I found out that in order for the phone to interface with the computer, the optional software is required. This phone also would not charge without the needed software. Although, this feature is not important to me. Final thoughts: As a basic no thrill cell phone it's okay. But the paint finish quality leaves a lot to be desire in my opinion. The ring tone using the vibrator feature is so so being kind are weak. Under some circumstances it may not be felt.",neutral

"It works for me, but just barely. I am using it in my office. My office does not have an outside wall, and I was getting zero to 1 bars without it. When I first installed this, I was able to find a location next to the ceiling where I had two bars consistently. I located the window unit there, but even though my phone showed 2 or 3 bars, my calls broke up severely. A few days ago, I put the window unit above the ceiling, where I had three bars, and it started working. However, the only way it works is if I leave my phone sitting next to the antenna, and use my bluetooth. If I move my phone as little as 6"" away I go to 0-1 bars. Any farther and I have no bars. My other big problem is that if the antenna is too close to the window unit, there is a back feed, and it stops working. That wouldn't be a huge problem, except the wire isn't all that long, and once you run it down the wall, and across the room, it is nearly impossible for it not to pick up the antenna and it stops working. Since installing it in the ceiling this problem went away, but I can no longer run the wire all the way to the floor and over to my desk. It looks pretty bad, and it may cause me problems with my boss. I wish I could add another 12-20 feet so I can install it neatly. Bottom line. If you don't have at least 3 bars where you locate the window unit, and you can't leave your phone sitting next to the antenna, then I would recommend you stay away from this item. One other comment is that I think it should be designed to work the other way around. The black antenna should mount on the window and the main unit should be located near the phone. Running both power and the antenna wire into the ceiling or to a window is just plain stupid. But, for $50 it is working for me, and I'm happier than I was.",neutral

"I have used Plantronics at work and I have a Plantronics bluetooth for my cell phone so I thought I was going to be much happier with this than I am. I recevied the phone a few weeks ago. I don't like the headset and would prefer something different. The Plantronics bluetooth piece for my cell phone fits much better. Withink a few days of purchase I broke the little button in the headset that activates the phone and they had to send me a new one. Warrant service from Plantronics was easy but the headset they sent is slightly different. The old one used to verbally tell me when I lost connection with the base, now it just beeps. Also there is no mute feature on the headset and you have to mute using the phone. The phone is designed like a small cell phone and I don't like the size of the keys. It's fine when I carry something in my pocket but not at home. Caller ID does not retain the name of the caller. I like that fact that I can answer both my cell and house phone using the same headset. I work from home and receive calls on both lines. It picks up line noise from the fans on my tower PC case. Not bad but I am sure that's where its coming from. A line filter would help. I think Plantronics needs to do a little work on this before it becomes a great model worth the money.",neutral

"I had ordered this one as on Amazon it looked different from the headsets Motorola is distributing with the RAZR (at T-Mobile). But it turned out to be identical to this useless piece of plastic. If you do not have Motorola ""normed"" ears (they need to be huge!!) this will fall out of your ear even without moving. I usually like Motorola products, but they should be ashamed of such a poorly thought out design. Well I guess there is a marketing strategy behind it. As there are no useful headsets for Motorola phones that have a usb-plug, they will get thousands of people who will go out and buy Motorola's bluetooth headset instead. If I ever decide to join the crowd of people looking like dorks with their headset glued to their ears, I promise it will not be a Motorola (Motorola, this is a message to you, do you hear me????)",negative
"I just got this at my local Radio Shack store for 30 bucks. Activating on Virgin Mobile USA's website gave me $2.50 in starter airtime. BTW the activation page appears to only work IE 6.0; I'd tried IE 7 and other browsers before I realized only IE 6 would work. The phone itself is stylish and very lightweight. I find the battery life acceptable - but then, I only use this for occasional calls and I don't access the Internet (VirginXL) at all. What I don't like about the phone is it's painfully slow. Even checking balance (by pressing the ""up"" key on the navigation pad) takes 30 seconds, vs. 5 seconds or so on my 7-Eleven Speak Out Wireless-running RAZR. Sometimes, even pressing the End key to return to the standby screen takes a full second, which is really slow for such an easy operation. This is an inexpensive but useful phone, if you don't mind its being on the slow side. You can still find it in Radio Shack, Virgin and many other stores, as well as on Virgin Mobile USA's website.",neutral
"I really like my 60CSx and the car mount is excellent, but this mount needs better engineering. The mount itself only fits a few sizes of handle bars and it's hard to get the ends of the clamp lined up and get the screw going straight into the plastic. It won't take a lot to strip the plastic threads. I figure if you take it off 4 to 6 times, it'll be history. There is no way to change the angle of the mount without removing the mount and repositioning it. If the sun is reflecting off it into your eyes, too bad. The piece that connects the GPS to the mount is a pretty good setup and seems to work OK for a bicycle. In a car, the power cord interferes with taking the GPS on and off and you need to grind off a corner of the plastic piece, but on a bike this is a non issue. All-in-all, for the price of this, I expect a lot more. At least a longer lasting and more secure metal clamp for the base like anything else for a bicycle has, and an adjustable angle that is easy to clamp down - maybe with a thumb screw.",negative
"A solid three star value. It has already saved my phone a few times, which it is designed to do. That being said, it has two big annoyances. First, the buttons are not only hard to press, the volume often will do the reverse of what you intended since your S4 has one button for up and down and you have to press it in the exact correct spot. Second, you can't use your camera with the flash. The case will reflect a white haze across half the picture that will ruin it.",neutral

"I've had this clear case for about two weeks. I haven't had any difficulties getting it off as others indicated. I've dropped my phone and it has protected it. My only concern is that the screen is not covered so if I were to drop my phone at the right angle, the screen would probably crack. Also, the clip is annoying. I put it on to test it out, but then tried to removed it and ended up breaking the clip part as it didn't slide on and off easily.",positive
It does make my phone last longer. But I am taking away one star because I was expecting my phone to last longer.

"This sucks!! Years ago I used to be a proud owner of the D&G MotoRAZR and loved it! I saw this one and on the description says it the Dolce & Gabbana V3i. Well its not! First of all the original one comes in a Golden color box, this one comes in a regular V3i phone, the original one is engraved with the name brand DOLCE & GABBANA and this one the engraved is sooooo cheap and not even aligned. The color of the original one is a light golden color, this one is a horrible golden brownish color and the list goes on and on, does not include the D&G special ringtones either. Im so dissapointed. This is a joke and the phone is a total cheap copy of the original one. >:(",negative
I ordered these for our trip to Hawaii in 2012. I used them pretty much 8days in the ocean and pool. I rinsed them with tap water after most uses. We went back to Hawaii in 2013.

"Three reasons not to buy this phone: 1. It may be unlocked, but it is not unbranded. It still says AT&T every time you turn it on, in the menu, and on the battery cover. 2. The battery loses its charge within a day. 3. It does not ship with the advertised ""European charger with U.S. adapter"". It is simply a U.S. charger. This phone is simply a lemon, and reading other reviews I realize I am not the first person to say so. Don't make the same mistake we did!",negative

"This was the best bluetooth I used until it stopped working. The voice isolation worked as advertised and worked seamlessly with my pocket PC. However the product is not durable.

It is going back to the store.",negative
"I bought these as replacement for my LG HBS-730 headset that had stopped working. I like the wrap-around style and these were one of only a few headsets available in that style. These Motorola Buds looked promising, but the headset it altogether too tight around my neck and is very uncomfortable to wear and I cannot keep them on for long. The headset is also quite heavy in comparison to the LG and I found this added to the level of discomfort The sound quality is good - a little bit of an echo, but that could also be part of getting the right size piece I guess. I'm returning mine and will look for another headset to replace my LG.",negative
"This was the best Bluetooth I have owned because of performance and more importantly the fit. It was very comfortable on my ear and inside the ear, and I could keep it on for hours and not even remember it was there. Sound quality and features are excellent and worked as advertised. I have used with various phones. I used it every day for about 2 years until it started to break at the hinge. I used to just stuff it in my purse without a special case or protection, so I am not surprised it finally gave in. I see this product being sold for a lot of $$$ now, but I don't think I paid more than $40 for it. So it was a great deal and a great value. If I see it on sale again, I would buy it.",positive
"Pros: Easy to wear. Seems to stay in the ear and is comfortable. When the phone is close has a nice clear sound. Inexpensive. Cons: Some static if the fone is more than 2 feet away. The voice recognition is unrecognizable, can't understand anything it says and it doesn't dial whom you request. Best if you either dial or use the phonebook function. This is my first wireless headset for my cell phone and I feel that if I spent another $20 I would have done much better. I am sort of satisfied with the WEP200 since I haven't used another wireless headset.",neutral

I've just ordered my 4th and 5th (backup) set of these. Though I'm embarrassed to say I used to buy these from Griffin directly at ~$20 each. My first two lasted about 2-3 months with the cable splitting at the jack both times. This last pair managed to stay intact for several months but lost connectivity to one of the speakers.

When using the cell phone near the computer I had noticed it created an interference in the computers audio, by using the handset I can move the phone away from the computer to remedy this problem. Also if the phone is that powerful I don't think I wanted it up to my ear anyway so the handset remedies this by keeping the phone away from the side of your head. Great inexpensive product.",positive

"The latest flip phone by Nokia is what you call a basic phone with added features at a reasonably low price. It has been 1 month since i have owned it and i did come across a few issues which are 1) the battery status bar is not accurate. I took the liberty of not charging my phone for about 4 days looking at the bar which showed about 75% ,and on the 5th day it went dead. But thankfully it came alive after i charged it overnight. So i guess it has to be charged daily. 2) It supports MP3 ringtones but it has about 4 MB of memory. 4mb? it is too minimal for a phone to support media and mp3.3 pics and 2 ringtones ...and the memory is full. I had to get rid of most of the nokia logos and ringtones to accomodate my personal stuff. Anyway the phone is pretty okie but it would do better with a memory card slot. Considering the number of free and reasonably good phones available this is a so-so deal. At least it was better than my earlier phone the siemens flip phone.

"I previously had the LG Shine, I really liked the phone but my 2 yr old broke it. It didn't break my heart because I really wanted a phone with a qwerty keyboard for texting, and I was eligible for upgrade. Since I was very pleased with the Shine, I decided to stick with LG and go for the Vu. I am VERY displeased with the camera on this phone! Everything is blurry, unless you are able to be perfectly still and in perfect lighting. I have adjusted settings, nothing seems to help. If someone can offer tips, it would be appreciated. The Shine had an excellent camera, that even had flash. Having a toddler, I love this feature, it assures I don't miss any special moments just because I don't have my camera with me. The touch screen works fine and reception is good. Which are the most important things in a phone. Battery life is a little less than the shine, but the screen is bigger, brighter and the keyboard vibrates I would assume that would take more energy. I am also very disapointed with the ringtone capability on this phone. Ringtones that I was able to use before on the Shine, are too large to be used as ringtones on the Vu?!! Why would LG do this? Overall, it's a phone. It's good for talking and texting. If you aren't interested in the camera or having a wide variety of ringtones... this is a really good phone. It just seems that instead of improving on what they already had right, LG took a step back with the ""features"" on this phone. Can't quite understand that. This will probably be my last LG phone.",neutral
"Beware, this product is very limited for a Motorola V750. Most of the features are unavailable. The only thing you can do with it is transfer phone contacts and calendar items.

The unit seems to work better than the Motorola 500 and 700 that it replaced. BUT it is too heavy and it is really difficult to switch calls (call waiting) and hurts your ear more to wear than the Motorola.

This phone is very cheaply made and it definitely shows. Horrible quality. I can't think of one positive thing to say about it.

"I spent many hours researching the latest and greatest of blue tooth headsets and chose this one based on perceived quality. Price was not a big issue. It is very lightweight which was great. Easy to use as well. The biggest problem was the sound level. You can hear the caller if you are in a quiet place. However, as soon as the level of noise increased in the area you are calling it becomes very difficult to hear. I think the problem is the ear piece. It does not go into the ear, but rather sits on the outside. I have a Plantronics 510 and it worked with my older phone very well. it has an earpiece that goes into the ear and you can set the volume much higher. I only switched because I was getting a lot of static in the headset with the new phone (3G technology may be the issue...I don't know). I would not recommend this headset to anyone working in a potentially noisy environement (driving with the windows open, walking outside, etc)",negative
Looking forward to this 700w for quite sometimes. Sad thing is Verizon wants too much money out of your pocket and make nothing working on the unit for you. You have EVDO services and cannot use it as a bluetooth modem for your laptop internet access. You go buy the wifi card that doesn't work with any internet voip applicaiton or corporate PEAP-GTC network because it's asking for a personal certicate (no..root certificate won't work). You claim the rebate too fast. So you are stuck with the phone. What is good? My son likes the bubble pop game I guess that's the good part of it....and i use it to check the date and time.

"***NOTE: This includes the same model being sold at Wal-Mart stores.*** ***This is the same product as this model case.************************ I am currently on my third (and final) Body Glove case for my Motorola Razr V3.

"I bought this booster for my camper when I stay in the woods at some distance from cell towers. In the particular area I am staying, you can just occasionally get a received call through but it usually gets dropped quickly. So I set up this booster with the boosted signal antenna inside the camper as recommended. But the only way to get a call through is to hold the phone inches away from the inside antenna. And even then if I move away just slightly, sometimes the call gets dropped. So I called the help line from Wilson and told them of my problem. And they told me that if there was a weak signal outside, then the signal would be weak inside. If that is true, I wonder about the claims that it will boost the signal by six times. And they told me the only way to fix that is to buy a bigger antenna or put this one higher.

"I have two of these. One of them works the other has a very hollow and tinny sound. People constantly complain they cannot hear what is being said. So I called BlueAnt technical support, twice. This was after trying to deal with them by email. The first time when we got to the point where I said I wanted a replacement unit the support guy hung up on me. The second time I was told I needed to go through a process that would take about 30 minutes. At the end of that process they might have me send the unit back and they would try it with other phones - I guess the iPhones (3 of them), the Motorola and the Nokia I had tried were not good enough - then decide if they were going to replace it. So basically I would send it to them and they would send it back and say it was fine or working to their spec. From other comments here there are many people with the same problem and judging by some of those comments there are a large number that have had trouble with their call center. If the product works it is OK, not stunning but does its job, but if it does not work or if it fails beyond Amazon's return window then you are in serious trouble. My experience saw a 50% failure rate. ANNND this is with a fairly simple piece of technology, how reliable is their more complex stuff likely to be. BlueAnt products fail, I understand that, but their customer support policy appears to be to run out the clock or come up with arbitrary rules as to what constitutes working, or simply hang up until you get tired of calling. With those policies it is easy to offer a 2 year warranty.",negative
"The sound quality on this phone is excellent. It's far better than any land line I've ever used. Communication between two RAZR phone's are crystal clear. I love the sound quality. This phone is also a great phone for doing just about everything you could possibly think of on a phone. In conjunction with the $30 functionality software for integrating with the PC, you can make your own ring tones, manage files, add personalized photo's, etc. However, there is a problem with this phone that makes me a little nutty. The software on this phone has a memory leak. If the phone is left 'on' in the on position, ie the phone is on but in the 'hibernate' mode, and not shut down via the red power button, the phone will take on a behavior all it's own. Since my cell phone is also my 'home' phone, I leave the phone on all the time and simply recharge when necessary. I've noticed several times where the phone would not follow commands from buttons properly, or, the volume chooser will go up and down and up and down on it's own. In every instance just 'shutting down' the phone didn't resolve the problem. The phone needed to be shut down for 5 minutes or more, an irritation for sure. I'd say that the development staff for the software on this computer need to perform further testing when the phone is left on all of the time.",positive
I recently purchased this earpiece for my fiance. She likes the earpiece and I can hear her very clearly on it. However there is a huge problem with the device. It has automatic noise cancellation and it is supposed to increase the volume automatically depending on the amount of background noise. When she is talking to me and opens her fridge or turns on her sink or throws away a piece of paper the earpiece amplifies the background noise so much that it sounds like it is going to blow out my eardrum. Instead of cancelling the background noise it amplifies it louder than her voice.,neutral
"I got this phone as an upgrade from the Samsung e317 about a month ago. Overall I've enjoyed using this phone. It's solid as a phone, music player, and it's thin. The phone fits in my pocket nice and easy. Battery life for me has been average and the camera is ok. I like Samsung for their applications and ease of use, especially how easy it is to put it in silent mode. This phone continues with that tradition. It's easy to customize contacts with ringtones, photos, and change shortcut buttons. What makes this phone really better than my old one is the microSD. It's really easy to add photos, MP3s, and video clips to the card. I just use the adapter, that's included, to turn the micro into a standard SD card, and plugged it into my computer to add the files. Once the files are on the card it's easy to find them. You can tell Samsung focused on audio. There is a button specifically for the music player, which allows you to create playlists, search by artist, and albums. The phone comes with an adapter that allows you to use standard headphones but it's awkward, it does come with Bluetooth stereo capabilities, but I haven't used that yet. On the bottom of the phone is a speaker that I thought didn't work until one day I closed the phone while music was playing and suddenly music came out of it, which was a nice surprise. Also that speaker does playback MP3 ringtones and message alerts when phone is closed, I have no problem hearing the phone while it's in my pocket. When I first got this phone and saw it could play videos, I wonder what it would be like to watch videos on a cell phone screen. It turned out to be pretty neat watching music videos, movie trailers, and sport clips on it. It's great showing them to my friends. Battery life for me has been average when compared to my old phone, lasting about 3 days between charges. Perhaps that's because I use more of the multimedia functions like listening to music and watching videos. Also it takes forever to charge the battery. Another thing I didn't like was the camera and its rotating camera lens. It feels the camera responds slower then on my old phone and makes it difficult taking pictures of kids, who never want to sit still long enough to prevent blurry pictures. Once the camera snaps the final photo doesn't match what I thought was initially shown on screen. I tried to use the external screen as a viewfinder like my old phone, but I couldn't, so I'm stuck having to keep the phone open to use the camera. The problem with the rotating lens is that when it's rotated to face away from the user it reverses the image when the image is upright. To prevent reversing the image you have to take pictures upside down which is really hard to do. The up button on the side of the phone allows you to change the perspective of the lens.",positive

"If you want a phone with camera because you actually plan to use the camera this phone is not it, it's rare to get a clear image w/it! It's compact and that's nice for purses and junk. You can find many accessories for it, and if you like musictones they sound great on this phone! I have never had any problems w/reception. I think that the best thing about it is that it is durable. I have dropped it too many times to count on cement and tile, and I didn't break any part of the phone or camera. Seriously though, had it not come free w/my plan I would have NEVER gotten it. It's really not worth paying for.",neutral
"It's soo cool, it arrives in a beautiful transparent display case with all the trimmings and it just looks like you bought a gem. Yes, it does not fit perfectly, but working on the bits and tids you can make it. Then you realize how poorly this device has been designed. In fact I don't think it was designed at all, unless it was designed by an idiot. How can anybody but an idiot embed the only one functional button you need in the whole external surface of the device? The first few days it's all the same story: you are on a call, you can't hear well for some reason (or the device moves slightly from the ear), you push it in you ear to hear better, and doing so, since the whole external surface of it responds to pressure, you hang up. This is bad, I mean really bad, maddening in fact, but it's nothing compared to the other beautiful feature: you switch it off and put it somewhere, it does not matter where, in your pocket, in your bag, in a cup holder, whatever. You can be sure that the next time your telephone rings you will find yourself shouting into the handset ""hello! hello!"" but no, the bloody thing has switched itself on (it just needs a little pressure, there is no safe place) and it is now paired with the phone, so your telephone is not usable anymore unless you find the Jawbone (which could be in another room for what you know, in your bag for example). A device that switches itself on or off because you just put it into a pocket is a piece of junk. I need something that works, coolness is a plus. Not vice versa. I am so mad I bought this insult to intelligence that I cannot see it about me anymore.",negative
"I guess I was expecting more. I wanted a dock that could hold the phone in landscape as well as portrait mode. And something with a real connector, not a cable that is short, stiff and generally obnoxious. While it holds my phone with standard battery, it won't hold it with the 3500mAh battery I prefer to use. I also experience a lack of reaction to touching the screen when it is plugged into the wall. Very strange, not sure what would cause that. I'll probably keep this for when I travel and need to charge 2 batteries, but I wouldn't really recommend this to anyone as a real solution for needing a cradle for the Droid Incredible.",negative

"A few weeks into using this product and I'm having some odd issues. 1 - the battery life is not quite as suggested 2 - I have to keep my head unnaturally still during a call to keep any clarity on phone calls 3 - there is a noticeable lag to audio on this device (just over 1 second), which makes it challenging to use audio on language-learning apps, snapchat and other kinds of communication apps. I don't know if that's inherent to all types of stereo bluetooth headsets or just this one. 4 - while exercising, the device will often change the EQ on its own. 5 - sometimes it will not respond to button presses, especially the play/pause button. 6 - I'm not sure why, but the device will sometimes not respond even if the battery is not yet dead. Despite all this, I enjoy how lightweight the unit is and the simplicity of its design. Even though the device sits snugly on my neck, I have forgotten I'm wearing it more than once. I was worried I would have broken it or messed up the cables by now, but so far, it's held up to some less-than-genius ideas in my sometimes absent-minded student/amateur athlete/shameless prototyper lifestyle. The magnet feature for the headphones is fantastic and I am really rather impressed with the audio quality. Occasionally I have trouble keeping the buds in my ears when exercising but have learned that's mostly because I may have pulled one out to do something or talk to someone and sweat got between the plug and my ear. I may have to return them for the problems I'm facing, and if I can write a second review after that, or delete and replace this one, I will.",neutral

"After a ""by the book"" installation, I have to say that I am very disappointed with this device. They said that it will bring a strong cell phone signal from outside the building to inside the building to up a 2,500' radius: that's maybe true. But, they failed to mention that only works in an open space, like a warehouse or big garage. They said that walls will reduce the signal; not true; it will stop the signal! I could not get a signal improvement while sitting in a sofa, just 10 feet away from the base station. The only time this thing did what they claim it does is when I was within 25 feet from it, with no obstacles. So, if you are planning to use the cell phone while been basically next to the base station, sure it works; otherwise, don't waste your money. A simple sofa or a simple thin sheetrock wall will block the signal, even a small child will block the signal. Perhaps you will have to spend hundreds more for their ""accessories"" to get it to perform better. Bottom line; is not good.",negative

The 700 is very muffled on my end and every one says my calls were staticy on there end and then to top it off When I was getting in my car I bumped it pretty good on my door frame and now it works for sh@t. So newer isn't always better. The 500 had good sound on my end and my friends said it sounded normal on there end. Came with lots of goodies charges quick, long long battery life only thing is it's a little bigger then the newer models but it's still small in comparison to most and it fits your ear awsome. My advice BUY THE 500 SERIES BEST BANG FOR THE BUCK!!!!!",neutral
Fulfilled my two wishes for a spare charger for my desk at work. It was cheap and it works...,positive
Cord has worn with age and moving it back and forth from the dash to glove box. Works great although occasionally takes you in circles. Highly recommended although I would buy one with lifetime maps in the future as mine is a bit outdated and probably better to buy a new one than to buy a new cord and take the time and trouble to get maps loaded on this one. (looked into it and sounds like a bit of work to download the maps - need appropriate equipment etc. maybe easier for someone more savvy),positive
"I ordered this phone on te advise of my Grandaughter, she said it was a good phone from past experience. I am 70 yrs old and only wanted a phone that was easy to operate, say hello & goodbye, don't care about text or hardly anyother features. I got this phone in while out of town and my husband opened it and immediately threw away the order slip and packaging. When I arrived back home I tried to set the phone up. It only had a small quick reference guide in the package and now the battery will only stay charged 1/2 day. Can take battery out and put back in and it will show fully charged. Anyone got any answers to the problem since company it came from says no returns",negative
"This isn't worth it, it's cheap made, too small for ip4s with case on, only clips one way, gave mine away.",negative
"This isn't a bad little headset.. I picked it up cheap for use with my PS3. It pairs up easily and the sound quality is as good as any other headset I've used. If I had to do it over again, though, I doubt I would buy this model for gaming. There's no mute function, which isn't a must have, but it's very convenient for coughing or answering a phone call. The biggest downside is the AAAA battery. AAAA's pricey little buggers, especially if you buy them in a retail store. Amazon sells a 6 pack for $6, that's the cheapest I've seen. If you're looking for a PS3 headset, you might want to have a look at the soon to be released SOCOM headset, it looks to be ideal for gaming (as it should be).",neutral
Install and set up were easy enough. I live in a one story brick house with a metal roof. Sprint cell phone antennas are less then half a mile away. We could not get a reliable connections in side with a sprint phone. It would drop out or go into roam. After installing the extender we were able to get minimum service connection in the room with the extender. Walk to another room and you lose it. At least we don't have to go out side to answer our cell phone now.,neutral
"Received as a gift lasted about 1 and a half years. Enjoyed it while it lasted. Considering it was under $20, worth it!",neutral
Actually have not been able to get it to work. Was able to pair to my phone but It doesn't work right,negative
