"The Wilson product did improve our cell signal from 0-1 to 1-3 depending on the ""moon."" I expected the signal booster to pull the signal out of thin air and give me four bars, but it did not do that. It pulled the signal our of thin air and made it usable at 1-3 bars.

"I took this item on a trip to Greece 2 weeks ago. It worked for about 5 minutes in our Athens hotel and then stopped. It never worked again. I used to live in Europe and had a similar item years ago from a different manufacturer. It took nearly 14 years for that one to wear out, but I guess that was back when products were better made. I do not recommend this product. However, the shipper delivered promptly.",negative
"got this battery at the beginning of March to replace RAZR battery that wouldn't last a day anymore (it originally would last 2-3 days on average amount of usage) upon receiving it, this battery would only hold a charge about a day and as of now (mid-june) it no longer will take a charge. in other words, this IS NOT an OEM Motorola battery, please avoid.",negative
"I cant really tell between good quality sound and better quality sound, but these earphones sound horrible. THere is static, when listening to music, and the people your talking to hear echoes.

"I got this in the thanksgiving sale. The look is good and matched my black Samsung A900 cell phone. Voice quality is good on my end but the other side complains about strong static.

"Very good product! Works fine with my mobile phone and Nextel radio. Before BT5020 I'd answer the phone only and had to use my hands to talk on the radio. Now I can drive and talk easily on both. Actually I'm a fan of Jabra products. I really like the design and the fact that the device stays hidden. I don't like those devices that everybody sees a huge insect eating your ear... Regarding BT5020 I'd say the next level would be peering to more than 2 devices ""simultaneously"". Also you can improve the design because it's a little bit uncomfortable on the ear and doesn't fit so well as the BT500 did. Maybe because of those rubber attachable pieces that the BT500 has. Somehow the BT500 fits better... But as I said previously, all in all, great product.",positive
"Best phone from old times ever! Slick, chic and classy. Too bad the battery doesn't last long, about 4-6 hours tops and with all the smartphones today you can't be part of that world whit this phone. I bought for a trip to Brazil in 2010, when smartphones were not that common and networks were 2G only. Work on any GSM network. Good nostalgia feeling with this one, when people didn't have to be online all the time and phone calls were actually made.",positive
This hands free bluetooth works great. The reception is very clear and the mike works great. The only problem I have had with it is that it is uncomfortable on my ear. The loop hurts the inside of my ear. I tried cutting the loop off and it got better but it does tend to fall out sometimes. I started using it with the included ear hook to hold it in place better. I know I have a strange ear. None of those headsets that hang off the ear work for me because I have a small ear that does not lay flat against my head so I can't support those hooks. They should make a hook that can be adjusted with a wire inside to fit small ears like mine. That is why I gave it three stars. The charger works great and fast. It is easy to set up and my Treo 650 finds it with no problems. Wish I could find a comfortable headset though. I think its a great unit for the price.,neutral
The first phone I got was used and didn't work. The second phone I still had battery problems and it never worked right. I just gave up. A solid POS!!!,negative
"I ordered a couple of these to attach my cell phone to the car - an alternative to the phone mounts that have an arm that suctions to the window (which is illegal in CA). So far, it has worked perfectly! I would highly recommend this if you have the space in your car. Why didn't I give it 5 stars? Well, I bought a few of these, and the 2nd one that opened up, the sticky on the car mount didn't work. A little bummed, but not a big issue. I will update this in a few months.

"This phone is a pretty good phone. It accepts the use of micro sd cards which greatly improve the use of the phone by allowing the user to use the phone for music, movies, and pictures. The touch screen is also a nice touch (pun intended). The only downfall that the phone has is the keyboard. Its a regular phone keyboard but the buttons are too closely spaced together, making text messaging and dialing phone numbers a hasle.",positive
"This is the very best bluetooth earpiece I have worn and used. It connects instantly, usually lasts for 2-3 days when left on 24/7 with 3-4 hours of talking. It's true it picks up background noises-- just as with ANY wired mic. The beauty is that there is NO connection static with the BT500. Voice commands at a touch, connect and disconnect at touch. Easy, immediate pairing. The earpiece even recongizes whether I'm using a silent or loud profile and changes whether it produces a ringing tone (to match the phone's audible profile) or no tone (for the phone's silent profile). I'm paired with a Nokia 6682. Every Motorola product I tried produced extreme static noise on the called/caller end from a flaky bluetooth connection. None of that here. The only complaints I have are getting the thing on initially-- it's a snug fit over the ear. If you haven't worn a Jabra product before, all I can say is it's different in that it fits inside the ear instead of just laying against the outside of your ear like a traditional phone handset speaker. Once on however, I often forget I have it on. Second complaint is from the general public. Most people are used to that pager-sized backlit Motorola hanging off of everyone else's face. With the BT500 I often get comments about my ""earring"" from guys, my ""hearing aid"" from children and the elderly, or being ""assimilated into the Borg"" from (fellow) techies. LOL This is a top-shelf, five-star product. I am PICKY TO A TEMPER with my electronics. EXCELLENT (and about time).",positive
"I bought this phone in July from Radio Shack (RS). The main reason was to pair with my Acura TL. Poor reception, dropped calls, static, poor Bluetooth abilities, does not work on incoming calls in my TL. Communicated with RS, Moto and VZ. all three told me it was Acura. Acura refers me to Handsfree Link, Verizon never gave them the phone for testing before moving this to production. (This is done with all other wireless companies). RS exchanged the phone in Sept. Oct. I find that it is not the car but the phone. VZ bluntly told me it is my problem, discuss it with RS. RS said discuss it with Moto. Moto states that they know there is a problem with the Bluetooth but do not know how to distribute the fix. No one will refund me the price of the phone that I bought outright and paid in excess of $400, because it is now over 30 days old. I travel nationwide and have the same reception problems in all parts of the country. My Qualcom from 1997 and My Nokia from 2001 perform better then this phone. Poor picture abilities, can't transfer files form phone to my laptop using Bluetooth as VZ disabled this. I will write off the phone and have my company switch me to Cingular.",negative
"The Voyager 510 works like a charm. Connects easily and fairly quickly, I guess (my first cell phone and my first Bluetooth headset). Range is incredible, although I can't conceive any situation in which I'd need to go more than five feet away from my phone (it's usually in my pocket or on my desk). So far I've gotten great battery life. I like the blue LED. A few downsides: -Frequency range of the headset isn't fantastic. The sound quality of it is good, but not superb. This is more of a problem with Bluetooth than with the headset itself, though. -Ergonomically questionable-- it fits very well once you get it on, but it's a little hard to adjust, especially when it's on your ear. It also feels very flimsy. I wouldn't mind having a little more weight so I could feel safe just putting it in my jeans pocket. -Volume buttons and especially the power buttton are rather hard to fiddle with while it's on your ear.",positive

Installation could have been made easier by the manufacturer, however, if they'd made the screw holes through and through on the back or marked the position of the holes for better visualization while hanging. It would have been nice to include the measurement between the two screws. I measured and determined it easier to use centimeters than inches, btw.",positive

"So i got this phone for my sister as a replacement for her previous phone which was an old V3. I do love the styling of this phone and it has a very sturdy feel when compared to other phones in its price range. The flip opens very fluidly and I love the casing. However, thats where everything ends. I mean motorola has this beautiful screen and uses the UGLIEST interface I've ever seen. Honestly, if you were one of those people who bought into the Razr fad and seem to continue to buy more just out of habit, i really recommend going to your local AT&T first. In the cell phone market and I'm talking internationally. There are two leaders in terms of quality and design and those are Nokia and Sony Ericsson (SE). You might look at their phones and think that they have a cheaper feel to them or just seem to simple. But its not the outsides that set them apart. Its the insides. What I've always hated about motorola is that it seems like while they update the hardware from time to time, they still use the SAME useless unintuitive software they came out with like 5 years ago. I have been a loyal consumer of SE and if you take a phone from 5 years ago and compare it to one out now, you will notice more fluidity in the menus, faster shortcuts, a more intuitive system. The same goes with nokia, which used to have a simple interface but now has buffed up there menu system to compete aesthetically. I really recommend trying both phones and seeing how quickly there menus work compared to Motorola. I've lived outside of the country for 3 years and SE and Nokia always lead the market. Samsung solely relies on making their phones thinner then everyone elses and motorola is just banking on this ""High fashion"" razr/krzr/slvr styling. Yet I see them as the dominant phones in the US market! CHECK OUT SE and NOKIA before settling on simple style. Once you make the switch to either, you won't want to go back.",neutral

"This product is awful. It was ok when I installed it, but then it didn't even last long. Right after applying the screen protector, it immediately showed signs that the adhesive wasn't strong enough. The edges were lifted and it allowed dust to get inside the protector.

"Again, stay away from this phone. I've made the mistake not to take into consideration the negative reviews that had previously been posted on this site (btw, it looks like I am the first to do a review for this phone; that's funny, I was here the day before and there were multiple other reviews for this V600) and went ahead and bought the phone. Major mistake. I got the phone Nov 22 and ever since I've been having only problems with it. I am returning it to Amazon for replacement with another phone. Not Motorola for sure. It loses the signal just out of the blue, and it won't come back to life for anywhere between 10-15 minutes and a couple of hours. If during this time I want to make a call I have to power it off and back on. I have 2 other lines with T-Mobile with different phones, and they all work in the same areas and conditions. It also appears that Cingular (another GSM carrier which had this phone) already pulled it off the market for reasons unknown to me. I can only guess why :-) Otherwise, nice features, it is small enough, Bluetooth compatible, takes decent photos. Too bad it can't do what it is actually supposed to do best: make and receive calls!",negative
"I've read other reviews which state this model has taken out the second VGA camera which allowed for video calls, which is reason it gets 3 instead of 5 stars. If the manufactors and distributors read these reviews then I would hope they will take my advice to make the perfect pda/umpc as the Advantage almost is, would be to keep everything the x7500 had and to include both a second camera for video calls, window mobile 6 os, a radio, gps, 8gb or higher flash memory and slot for sd card, instead of less capacity micro or mini sd cards. And lastly it needs a scroll wheel for easy navigation. If I can find a pda like that I would buy it. The only thing close is the Loox t830 but it has too small a screen and still only runs windows mobile 5.",neutral
"I read a lot of reviews on the product and then purchased this recently. I have to say it is excellent. Much better than the Polycom or Jabra products. A couple of nice features: 1) Multiple phone connect 2) Auto connect to phone (this works almost too well. When my car is in the garage in my house, this sometimes gets picked up). 3) Extremely clear speaker 4) Phonebook announcement for callers So, it's nice to have the announcement when I'm driving. If the person is in your address book and you uploaded it to the SuperAnt, it will say ""Joe Smith calling..."" The speaker is also loud enough to use for conference calls on its own. I compared this with the $500 Polycom conferencing speakerphone, which did not sound as loud nor did it sound as clear on the other end for the listeners. Also, this uses a magnetic clip which is cool - I can disconnect easily to put in my laptop bag if needed. The battery lasts an astonishingly long time. I think I charge it once a month. Hope this helps!",positive

"These Motorola headphones are included in the V-Cast Music Essentials kit sold by Verizon and are worthless if you want to use them in anyplace that has any ambient noise. The earpieces are hyper-stylish flat discs with rather sharp edges that cannot seat in your ear at all (unless you have ear canals the size of dimes); they seat in your ear worse than iPod headphones, makiing it impossible to use them on, say, the bus. What they were thinking, I'll never know: using them in the car is illegal (both ears can't be covered) and they are useless for exercising: they fall out just sitting there, never mind trying to jog with them. Someone is going to make a mint making in-ear adapters; Motorola would be well advised to just offer a microphone/clip thing you can plug a pair of decent in-ears into in future.",negative

"My phone was bought on Amazon in September 2011, brand-new, first owner, with full warranty. One day, all keys suddenly stopped working except the red power key. When it is pushed, a message says ""Voice Record Memory Full"". I called Motorola customer service. At first they said, as long as it's not bought from eBay, it has regular 1 year warranty. So, as asked, I sent in phone, along with the purchase order paper. A few days later, it was returned and problem was not resolved; a paper stated ""out of warranty"". I called again and explained, and was asked to ship it back, which I did, again with order receipt. A few days layer, same thing - returned, not repaired with a paper saying ""out of warranty"". Called again and was told the phone had fluid damage and cannot be repaired, which I swear was not true! After escalating to talk with a supervisor, their story changed; they said it's out of warranty. I provided order receipt, which I did two times already and then, story changed again: the supervisor said the receipt cannot prove I am the first owner. I asked how I can prove that, she said, she does not know. This is how Motorola treated a small customer who cannot do anything about them!

"I chose the least expensive model for this device. The concept is a good one; however, the voice activation feature is inaccurate. It dials the incorrect party often. More times than not, it does not recognize my voice command, thus, I am reduced to using my handset to dial. The earpiece does not fit my ear and often shifts while I am driving (even though I have an average-shaped ear, close to my head). I press the device close in order to hear properly. In addition, I cannot tell when the device has turned itself off. The device is worth what I paid for it, no more. Do yourself a favor and buy the higher-priced model. Better yet, go to a store to experience the Bluetooth (or some other brand) before you purchase same. The engineer who designed this model needs to go back to the drawing-board.",negative

"When I found out Virgin Mobile was coming out with a camera phone all I could say was ""hell yea!"". Finally a camera phone on a pre-paid services plan. The v7 Flasher is great, not only for the camera, but for all the extra features I wasn't really expected. Superphonic ring tones, Wap brower, great battery life, great reception, and it's even smaller then I`d first though (the exact same size and weight as my v5 slider). The camera again is my main reason for wanting this phone and after testing it out under many different conditions it doesn't disappoint. The quality wonderful for a camera phone, and the process of sending pictures to your friends is a snap. You can send pictures either to another camera phone, to your virgin mobile online account, or directly to an e-mail address (doesn`t work with gmail, I`ve tried). One thing that pleasantly surprised me was that you can even take pictures while the phone is flipped closed and the small external screen acts as a viewfinder. My only gripe with this phone would be the overall look. There are so many sweet looking camera/flip phones out right now that this one just doesn't compare. I'm differently not complaining cause I love what this phone does and how well it does it, but if there were something I could change the look would be it. All n' all this phone is a must have for anyone looking to upgrade to the camera phone generation and not have to sign a contract.",positive

"We've had the Sidekick II for about two months. Although my 11-year-old likes it for its buttons and Gee Whiz value, I find it very awkward to use as a phone. It doesn't have a normal keyboard, so you must flip the screen up to press the keys, then flip the screen back down to listen and talk. When you get into a voicemail situation, you have to keep flipping the screen up to ""press 1 for English"", etc. Very annoying. You also must pay an additional $20 per month if you want to browse the Internet, use Instant Messaging, or even Download Fun. Otherwise, all you get is phone calls and text messaging (which is also extra). Even the non-sidekick phones let you get T-Zones for Instant Messaging as a $5.00 option. Another gripe is that the phone is falling apart after two months of not very rough usage. The screen no longer slips into place when flipped open and the letter ""A"" has fallen out. It occasionally just freezes for no reason. The first phone I received froze up the first day and had to be replaced. The battery is built into the phone, so you can't take it out to let the phone reset itself. No such thing as having an extra battery on a trip, for example. Internet browsing is cool, but so slow you think it stopped working. I think some of the fault is just the slow connection, but the other part of the fault is that the phone seems to take a long time to actually build the web page it's trying to display. Oh, yeah. Another problem is that T-Mobile expects you to pay $9.95 to set up your album on its web site, then 29 cents for each photo you upload to it. The phone is too large and heavy and has poor quality voice reproduction. You can't use wallpaper and the ring tones sound terrible. Although it looks good on paper, it isn't really ready for prime time.",negative

"The range is not more than 5 feet, not as proclaimed 33 feet. Very poor quality of sound. After trying it for one day I returned it.",negative
"This headset is definitely good looking and great sounding, however it has several fatal flaws. First is the awful design of the charger. The headset does not click into the charger, it just sits there so you have no idea if the headset light is off because it is fully charged or because the headset is not connected to the charger. Plantronics gives you adaptors for chargers of most popular cell phone brands, but that does not solve the design problem. My second issue is the poor fit of the headset. It is supposed to be held on by a gel earpiece. None of the earpieces fit me well. At one point, while wearing it in the car, the headset flew out of my ear and landed somewhere in the back seat. There is a loop you can add to secure the headset, however the loop makes the headset much less comfortable to wear. This means you have to periodically take the headset off to give your ear a break. This brings up the third flaw. The way that you switch the headset from one ear to the other is to turn the gel earpiece 90 degrees. The problem is that the way to remove the earpiece is to move it to the center position (45 degrees). I often had the earpiece pop out as I took the headset out to put it on or as I took it out of my pocket. My last issue with this headset is that there is no way to carry it with you. Some headsets come with a loop to hang it around your neck, others are comfortable enough to wear all the time. This one is neither. You could try to carry the headset in its charger but that is not a good idea either. Even though the charger has a clip to put in on your pocket like a pen, the headset does not sit securely on the charger, it can easily fall out as you lean over. Besides the charger is bulky, as thick as a magic marker and not convenient or comfortable to wear. The sound and the looks of this headset are excellent, but unfortunately they don't overcome the fatal flaws of the design.",negative
"This doesn't work miracles but it works well. I use it all the time for car camping and it's great. iPhone 6 fits.

"I had initially bought the Belkin armband from the apple store. It was a nice piece with some decent features and quality construction. However, since the case for the phone clipped onto the armband, the phone would flop around on my arm while running. Also, the band itself was a little thin with no edge seams. This caused it to dig in a little in places. So, I bought this one because of it's one piece design, wide contour coming off the case, and rolled seam on the band. In general, it is a great product. It's very comfortable and stays securely in place with no movement. Just a few quality and construction details let it down. The plastic screen cover is sewn on with ripples in it. This makes it hard to see and operate the screen. It's fine with music on shuffle, but if you're trying to watch a video while doing cardio or check on a pedometer app you have running, it's a distinct detraction. In addition, my screen came with a scratch in the plastic, on the inside, which added to this. The armband is also on the short side. My biceps are 15"" and I'm left with about 3/4"" of strap to fasten. Give it a little more strap and a smooth, slightly more rigid screen and you'd have a perfect product.",neutral
"I purchased this headset to replace a lost Motorola HS810 headset that I had been using with my Samsung i730 phone. I immediately noticed that not only is this headset just as bulky and loose feeling, but the volume is much lower! Connectivity is simple and flawless and the device will hold a charge for 24 hours or longer if not used continually. In any case, it's much better than the earphone/microphone that came with my phone. I initially inherited the HS810 from my business partner who has 50% hearing in his right ear and could not hear the HS810 headset. He purchased another model with an ear-bud. I have good hearing and was fine with the HS810 volume, but I must admit that when travelling in a car, I feel like I need a hearing aid to use the HS850! Not only is the volume lower on my end, but I am now getting complaints from those on the other end that they cannot hear me either. I never had this problem with the HS810 and am now considering purchasing a different device.",neutral
"Did not give me as much of increase as I had hoped for, then had to add a different attena to help it out. Does increase my phone from 1 to 3 bars (most of the time).",neutral
This product was used and in good shape. It was easy to install and works great! I recommend it to everyone who has a good signal outside but not inside.,positive
Not bad. When I took it out of the packaging I thought it was a little cheap but now that I have been using it I am OK with it. The only thing I would say negative is that 2 of the foam retainers are coming off. Not a big deal.,neutral
great,positive
Product is holding up very well and keeps my phone safe from scratches while not slipping out of my hand. It's nice you can buy just one instead of in a pack of 3 which I had only found before. I definitely recommend!,positive
"My daughter likes the case and I love the extra security it provides. She has dropped her hard molded clarinet case in the past and it popped open and the clarinet pieces have gone tumbling out. Now if she drops it, it will be in the zippered case. The shoulder strap is nice but she doesn't like to use it. It has a large pouch on the outside for her sheet music.",positive
"Great product, but understand what your buying. CALL the Wilson tech hotline and discuss your needs before you purchase. They are great, always answer and will carefully work you through the correct booster choice. This unit transmits maybe 5-8 ft. from your desktop at the most and that depends on having a fair signal outside to pull in. It works great for what it is designed for, just make sure you have a bar or 2 of signal outside to pull in and understand this will only transmit as the description says a desktop size area or very small room.",positive
"Very light and kind of flimsy. It keeps my cell phone and remote organized next to my bed, but you can't run the charge wire through is as if you pick up the phone the whole station comes with it.",negative
Motorola has the Bluetooth phone market cornered! I have been using only Motorola phones and Bluetooth head phones for three + years and find every head phone ear piece to work well with all of the mobile devices owned during the recent past.

This is by far the best phone hard case I've ever purchased. It was easy to install and is everything the manufacturer says it is. It fits snugly over the phone and stays that way. It also has a very clean and nice appearance. No less than 3 other people who have seen my phone with this case has inquired about and purchased this case for their own use. Highly recommended for anyone who works outside or does any kind of heavy work or activity.,positive
"Hi, I received the order after waiting long. When opened and saw the order I see that the charger is not in good condition.

"I wanted a lightweight case that protects my phone without adding a lot of bulk or weight. This case does exactly that. The black case also maintains the nice look and feel of the Motorola W385. However, I also wanted the option of clipping the phone to my belt at times. Unfortunately, the clip is a montrosity that doubles the depth of the phone. I removed it immediately after seeing how it looked. I knew it would result in the phone getting snagged and banging into things. No thanks. So if you want a nice, cheap, lightweight case that's not too fancy but looks decent, this will work. If you really need the clip, look elsewhere.",neutral

"After reading all the reviews on the x3 I ordered it and was very excited when it finally arrived. But that excitement quickly faded on the second day when I couldn't get the x3 to pair with my Treo. Numberous attempts were made without success. Finally I called tech support at BlueAnt and the tech advised me that the x3 was not compatible with the Treo 700p. The Tech at BlueAnt was very Helpful and advised me to try one of the Plantronics bluetooth earpieces, which I did and it works very well. I contacted DataVision which sold me the x3 on amazon, and was told by the rep that I could NOT return the product and DataVision would NOT refund my money because the product had been opened. The rep was very Rude and not helpful at all! I will NEVER purchase another product from DataVision again!",negative
"Just find out my location is too remote to have good and stable signal to be boosted. This testing signal strenght way should be posted on amazon, so that people will make less error in purchasing. The signal in my home is not good. Just one bar or two with tmobile. half of the time simply no connection. That is the reason for me to purchase this item. After failing to install the product, call technech support, and they ask me to test the strenght of signal by entering *3001#12345#* call and read the number on upper left of my iphone. My reading is -103, -107, and then searching. They told me, -50 is under the cellphone tower, -108 will lost the connection. Hope this information is useful for others.",neutral
"It arrived within one week. I love the cover! It is soo pretty! There were a few places with no paint and some glitter falls off when I use it and such . When it falls off and sticks to the screen that is really annoying. The hot pink color and tons of glitter make it soo flashy! I feel like a princess when I use my phone! Probably is way overpriced but I totally love this item! P.S. ~ after using it for a while, i realized that i didn't get very good service in places like a basement but everywhere else the service was decent. also, the top cover didn't ever really fit well and after i removed it once to clean my screen (which was full of glitter and other crumbs) it fell off somewhere and is now lost. how sad!",neutral

It has a great reception , I can leave my phone inside and still talk outside about 40 ft away. The only drawback is the side button you press to answer is very sensitive, so its very easy to call the last person you that you called by accident. Highly recommended.",positive

"Put simply, this product works. After reaching that point where I threatened to shoot the computer, cancel the cell phone or move, I looked around at alternatives. Finding the Wilson Signalboost online at Amazon, I did the internet obsessive search. Bought one, hoping for the best. Put the antenna in the attic facing out a gable vent, ran the wire and fired that sucker up. Immediately went from one and two bars to five. My only disappointment is that I didn't get the model which does the whole house. Maybe for x-mas.",positive

"Bought this to protect my new IPhone 5S from other things in my pocket, at first I was afraid it wouldn't fit with the cover on (Mophie Juice pack plus) but It's almost a perfect fit (It covers all but doesn't close completely), the pouch can also be used to clean fingerprints of the phone, total win!",positive
The battery only lasts a couple days before needing recharge. When new the original battery that came with the phone lasted 10-15 days. This replacement is significantly inferior and only useful if... your original battery can only hold a charge for a couple days AND you don't mind leaving the phone on the charger most of the time AND you don't want to pay the higher price for a good replacement battery,negative
Do you think they could have used any stronger adhesive for the film seperator tabs. Must have been super glue on the ones that I received!! Very hard to remove.

Good deal, no worries here.",positive
"Does what I want it to do. I works perfectly with my Motorola L2 phone. I was able to back up my address book and sync my outlook calendar. I transferred a custom ringtone. The thing that really makes it perfect for me is that it has an audio editor that edits MIDI files. I have a lot of MIDIs and they make better ring tones, but it's hard to find an editor so that you can cut them down to the necessary size. The sound editor contained in this package edits mp3s also. It was the easiest sound editor I ever used. There is no manual with it, but it's a very intuitive interface and you should be up and running in no time. They don't tell you, but you should know, if you add a ring tone to your phone, you have to shut down and restart your phone or else you won't be able to answer or make calls. Since I synched my calendar at the same time I did the ring tone transfer, I don't know if you have to ""reboot"" after doing any transfer to the phone. I would play it safe and do so.",positive

"This is a sleek little phone that I wish so very much would work better. I had it for two weeks. Most of the time it worked fine, however, sometimes I would go to pick it up off the counter where it had been sitting for hours and it would give me an error if I tried to push any buttons or make any calls. It would need to be restarted before it stopped doing this. Other times the screen would just go bright white and stay that way until I powered down the phone. The final straw was after going to bed with a full battery I woke up to find the phone dead and completely drained. Twice. Not good when you use your phone for your alarm clock. It's been returned. Pros: -God it looks sexy. -Sound/volume and everything phone-like about it was fine (provided it had battery power to work). -Nice big, bright screen. -Did I mention it looked awesome? Cons: -Battery/software issues -Makes me feel like a two fingered gorilla sometimes when trying to hold it it's so small and light. -Can't change the quick menu keys. Seriously, Samsung, how many people need the voice recorder taking up one of the quick keys? Neutral: -Camera. It's a phone, if you want a camera go buy one, but as far as camera phones go, there are better ones out there. This is average though.",negative

I installed the booster kit on an 8 ft pole attached to my rear ladder and aimed the box in a direction I thought was the nearest cell tower was located. Instantly my phone showed 3 bars and had cell service all around my coach for about 20 yards. We successfully use it with our Verizon air card as well.",positive
"The i850 has a great sounding speaker. It doesn't distort as other Nextel radios do. The display is good. The nice blue glow of the external display is nice, also. But the ""media center"" is painfully frustrating, and lack any good features that are common in other phones. There is no slide show feature, no flash for the camera. I can't figure out how to change the default picture size, so I have to adjust it before every picture. There's no video capability. The menu button and power buttons are annoyingly small. It is very frustrating every time I need to charge the battery because the connector on the phone has a cover that keeps getting in the way. I understand the need for the cover, but they should have used one that flips up and down instead of a rubber stopper. The battery life on this phone is terrible and makes the phone almost un-usable. I can't make it through an 8 hour workday with moderate usage. This phone is sturdily constructed and fairly well designed, but the user interface needs a lot more thought. My Sanyo MM-7400 phone that I had before this was much more easy to use and had more features, but I needed a Nextel for work. This phone is overall a nice looking and good working phone, but the many little annoyances make me wish I could use the Sanyo phone on the Nextel network.",neutral

"I have used several different Bluetooth headsets and this one by far is the best. Comfort and Quality are its most prominent traits. I have been told that the Mic is clear and lacks distortion. The sound levels are vivid for music and sharp for the phone. The base is better than most earbuds. The battery lasts about a week with moderate use. I suggest pairing them with Comply Tsx-500 Foam Tip replacements (note that Comply does not make a tip specifically for this product but the Tsx-500 fit well enough though a dot of super glue will be required to keep them on, well worth it). It enhances the base and cancels the noise rather well.",positive

It is very important that you follow the directions for placement of the attenae and receiver. It is a relatively inexpensive solution for poor reception.",neutral
"Connectivity is easy and reliable. Volume sound control is fine for the well hearing, but lacks base for the hearing impaired. Speaker end fits over the ear cavity, but if slightly smaller would fit more recessed and sound woould be mainly contained to the area of the ear it is intended.

"Overall I agree with the ""cool"" features of most of the reviewers. My problems are: 1. The phone book lists every entry seperately (example if I put my husbands work and mobile in my phone, the address book lists 2 entries, Husband and Husband 1) This can be fixed by setting one number as primary and setting book to only show primaries, but then if you want to see other numbers you have to go back thru the settings and set to view all numbers, then set it back again after you view the number you want. This is a very annoying feature for me. 2. The ringer volume is terrible. I have tried different ringtones, but still don't hear it if it is in my purse, or if I'm in the grocery store with it in my pocket or in my car. Never had that problem with my Nokia. 3. The vibrate feature is so light, even when the phone is in your jeans pocket you can barely feel a flutter. My Nokia you could feel the vibrate and sometimes even hear the vibrations.",neutral
"I was very skeptical after reading many bad reviews about the 850, but i still decided to purchase it.

I recently purchased the new model of the Voyager 510, the Voyager 520, and love it! It still has excellent battery life of the 510 (in fact, slightly longer battery life!), excellent noise and wind reduction, and very comfortable, all in a more traditional style. Search for Voyager 520 on Amazon, and check it out, if the 510 didn't quite work for you.",negative
"My opinion is, you would be better of purchasing the ""Creative Zen"" charger, not this cheap knock off version. The only reason why I purchased it because I misplaced the real deal (while moving) that I purchased from Creative. I knew that this wasn't going to be as good as the original one I purchased, but I didn't expect it to me so cheap. People don't intentionally drop stuff, sometimes it just happens. I dropped this cheap imitation knock off and it cracked open.

I got this phone becuase it was free with an upgrade. I had read reviews and thought it would be worth the money (none) to upgrade to it. It's a good phone. I've had it two days and the battery is still going strong... they say it takes a few rechargings to get the full potential out of the battery. On the plus side: I like the front screen that shows caller ID. It makes for a quick check to see if I want to answer or not. I also like the calendar. I can pull it up and quickly look at appointments. I haven't bought the data cable yet but plan to do so soon. I like the navigation disc... it's easy to get around in menus although the menus themselves are sometimes tricky... the cancel/exit/ok buttons switch sides on some menus. The Shortcut option is great... the menu on this thing is extensive so it's nice to be able to quickly get to often-used menu options. My biggest pet peeve people who let their phones go off in public places where they have no business answering a phone... so I love the vibrate option built into this phone. Speakerphone!! On the downside: I'm left-handed and the side buttons really are a pain. I can't hold the phone with my left hand for long. It'd be great to be able to disable the side buttons... or change their functions. The phone becomes very uncomfortable on my ear after awhile. I don't understand the need for the side button that allows for voice-calling since I must have the phone open to use that functionality anyhow. It's just in the way. The camera is pretty sad... I never understood the need for a camera on a phone in the first place and 640x480 is basically useless. Often times I've been entering contacts and I accidentally hit the hang-up button instead of the save button and PRESTO... I lose all my entered info! I want to be able to put my name on the front screen since my wife and I have identical phones... can't do it. Can't do it on the inside screen either (It'd be nice to take off my service provider's name too). I've been looking for a hack but haven't found one yet.,neutral

"I got the BlueAnt X3 Micro Headset for my new Cingular 3125 phone. The headset has simple good looks with and performs almost flawlessly in my experiences with the phone. The signal strength is excellent and voice quality is very good. It comes with a car charger and a wall charger that utilizes a USB cable. So you plug the headset into a USB cable and then into either car or wall charger. You can also plug it into your PC or Laptop to charge it as well. Very cool. As a side note though, the inclusion of a car charger that uses a USB interface means that I don't have to buy a new car charger for my phone, as it has a USB charging interface. All I have to do is plug the PC to Phone adapter cable into the car charger and I have an instant car charger for my phone. Cool for me, but if your phone doesn't feature charging through USB cables, it won't work for you. It's just an added bonus to me.",positive
"I ordered 2 batteries and received them in 3 days. Both batteries had a 11/2007 date on them so I guess they are over 4 years old. One battery said the cell origin was 'Japan.' The other one said 'China.' Guess which one doesn't fit, the China one. The back cover keeps popping off so the China one is thicker. I was able to fully charge them today so I'll report back whether they hold their charge or not. I'll probably have to return the China one since it doesn't fit.",neutral

"Admittedly, when this first became available, it sounded like a fabulous concept. Over a six month period, I purchased three Bundles, and subsequently bought many different adapters. I was highly annoyed, BTW, with the absence of the iPod adapter (IPDA-0001) from the Bundle, as others have written here. None were used in a mobile environment; mine sits on my desk, my wife's on her desk at work, and my step-daughter's on her desk at college, where they are not subjected to stress or abuse. Then the adapters started to fail. The first two iPod adapters split longitudinally along the plastic housing and died. The 3rd iPod adapter just croaked, period. And therein lies the story of the next two-and-a-half years, failure after failure: Two generic USB adapters (CHUA-0011), one mini-USB (MUSB-0001), one Plantronics (PLNA-00001) and two others. What is the problem? I'm convinced it's poor and shoddy manufacturing. Most of these adapters arrive out-of-the-box with the two ends out of sync, forcing the user to twist them in order for the charger hub and device-to-be charged to lie flat together. No matter how little force you exert, it is still too much for the obviously flimsy wiring connections inside the connector housings. I also noticed, as I replaced them, different wire lengths between the two connectors, especially on the iPod unit (they have also now changed the housing on that adapter, obviously due to the shell-splitting problem I mentioned above). That's another sign that whoever is producing these is not adhering to a specification, or Callpod changed suppliers, or both. Remember, all of this was just from simple desktop use, never detaching the adapters. I cannot imagine the failure rate if one were to utilize this system in a mobile application, where the adapters would be subjected to constant attachment/detachment cycles from the hub. The tines on the herkin' AC adapter do not fold into the housing, and, astonishingly, the tines on the optional ""mobile"" AC adapter don't either, so both are pretty much useless for travel, unless you want to damage items inside your case, or the case itself. I'm sick and tired of returning and replacing these adapters. I'm going to sell all three of the chargers and revert to outlet strips and multiple chargers. I strongly suggest you avoid this product... it was a great concept, but ownership is an absolute annoyance. September 2010 update: iPod adapter #4 R.I.P. Oy friggin' vey, I really hate this thing.",negative
"This is actually the second Plantronics Voyager 510 I purchased from Amazon. The first one was awesome. It was so good, in fact, that it ran through the washing machine and upon charging still worked great. Clarity in voice and reception were great. The second one; however, was not so good. I only purchased it because I lost the first one. I had read reviews from others who did not have such good luck with their second purchase of this item when the first was awesome. And yet, I gave it a shot anyway, becasue the first one was so awesome and durable enough to be washed and dried. But the second one is hard to hear and people on the other end complain that it sounds like I'm talking in a trash can and get a lot of background noise. With the first, there was virtually no background noise. I don't know what Plantronics did between the manufacturing batches but they need to undo it if they expect to maintain their reputation. After this second purchase, I wouldn't recommend this item to anyone.",negative
"Have been a loyal Plantronics customer for over 20 years - first PC video cards, then wired headsets, and now Bluetooth headsets. Had two of the 510's. They worked great for their function, but had to give up on them. Lost one, and used it's charger on the replacement 510 I bought. That original charger died - fair enough, just got out the charger that came with the new one. After a few months that one died, too. Figuring to side-step the apparent charger problem, I got the USB charger cable. Guess what - the 510 would not take a charge. Had to retire it and the pricey USB charger cable, and give up on Plantronics. Bought a new Motorola headset, and hope it works out - at least it's charge port is a mini-USB and not that strange thing Plantronics put on the 510.",negative

"A nice looking phone for a cheapie, fairly easy to use (with some odd quirks, I'm used to Nokias and Samsungs), with basic features that are enough for those who mostly want to make phone calls. The organizer works well and it's nice to be able to send text messages to multiple numbers, but the phone does have the annoying Motorola trait of only having one number per name entry. However, the v188 failed at even being a basic phone for me, as reception was notably worse than my Samsung X105 (which I've just gone back to after a few months of using the v188), and it got especially horrible when friends who also had T-Mobile picked up Motorola V330s. The printed manual was also poor, seeming like the writers just made sure they wrote about all the features as opposed to explaining them in-depth.",negative

"I had bought a new Razr last fall, and it had a speakerphone function, but didn't come with a corded hands-free headset, which I had been used to using on my previous Nokia phones. I decided to jump in on the bluetooth wagon and this model had gotten good reviews, and was (and still is) on a great sale here on amazon. I bought this in May. I've used it off and on, but keep finding myself going back to just using the speakerphone to be hands free. The fit is just not good for my ear. I'd say you should ""try it on"" before buying, but of course you can't. If you know someone who has one, maybe ask to borrow it. As other reviewers have mentioned, it just isn't a tight fit - it's not uncomfortable that way, but I would find that turning my head sharply to talk to my kids in the back seat would send it flying. It was super easy to connect to the Razr phone, but some people would mention that they had a hard time hearing me when I used it. I could always hear the other person. As it happens, my mother thought she had found this model of mine - I had to travel to her house within the last few weeks and hadn't seen it since - however, when I got it in the mail, it turns out to be an H700 model instead. We've asked all over, but can't find the owner, so I'm using it for now. It fits my ear much better and has the same or better sound quality and features (I think maybe it's just not the newest connection speed, but neither are most phones.) Personally, I would recommend it over this HS850. This wasn't bad, and certainly was a good price, but it didn't ""wow"" me. Not being an experienced bluetooth owner, maybe nothing would, but I can't give it more stars.",neutral
Pros - Elegant - Allows receive calls from 2 paired phones - high voice quality - Very stable behavior - Very comfortable on the ear - Long battery life Cons - It controls outgoing calls from the last paired device ONLY (I need to use voice commands in both phones).

"It is the right battery and it does make the phone work, but it is just enough fatter than the old one so that I can't click the back on the phone tight.

"I had three moto Q's die on me, so VZW's ""forced replacement matrix"" told the less-than-helpful rep that would be my new smart phone. I am a business user, so the one good point is that Winblowz Mobile 5 does synch beautifully with an Exchange server - when the phone works that is. Most of the time, it was slow, buggy, randomly reset and would literally not get through an entire day. In deference to the poster who said that ""the poster didn't charge the battery correctly intially"", I would respond please read the manual. It's a Li-Ion which actually works better with frequent top offs. Anyway, I have dumped it in favor of a BB Curve 8310 on AT&T and couldn't be happier. It is amazing to get through two full days on constant email and voice while not having to consider battery life. Plus the form factor of the Curve makes a Treo look like the old fat pig it is IMHO.",negative
"I needed a wireless headset to use at the Y with my iPhone. Already have a Plantrionics Voyager 855 that I really like, but the stereo connector quit working recently.

I bought a set this afternoon from my local Best Buy and will be returning them first thing tomorrow morning. Why? I can't wear them because I wear glasses! The S9 is designed to fit snugly against the head just above the ears right where the arms of glasses rest. Other reviews mention not being able to wear sunglasses, but for those of us unable to wear contacts or qualify for Lasik and doomed to glasses 24/7 should forget about buying these.

"After a lot of searching and reading other customer's review about ZENA Mobile I decided to go with them to replace my dead original Razr V3 phone. Why get a Razr again: I have all the software, cables, chargers and experience with it and do not need anything else. Plus, find a phone that survived a 23 feet drop on a concrete floor with only the battery poping out? Mine did 4 years ago. So I ordered from ZENA and received promptly a ""new"" Razr. It might have been new but wasn't like the original Motorola I had. That one was probably made in China (the included battery said so) but the case was not airplane aluminium and the keyboard was definitely not like the original. The metal was a lot thinner. In all, worked right out of the box, not surprises whatsoever, rock solid and very satisfied. The price was right, 1/10 what I paid for the previous one, both unlocked. And I picked regular shipping, which reach San Diego withing 3 days. Why spend money on express when the 'regular' works just fine? All in all, highly recommended, I would buy from ZENA again.",positive

I don't use my phone as a camera or music player so I can not comment on that. Battery - Several people have indicated problems with the battery in their reviews. The battery for this phone is the same as Nokia 6102. I previously had a Nokia 6102 and its battery lasted 4-5 days with moderate usage. When I got 6133, its battery drained out in 2 days. However when I enabled all the ""Power Saver"" options (settings => main/mini display, turn off screen saver, turn off keypad, start-up and switch off tones etc.) in 6133, the battery started lasting around 4-5 days with moderate usage. So I strongly suggest enabling all the power Saving options on this phone.",positive

Thus, calling it a original OEM cable is not accurate, I believe. For me it is not a major inconvenience in that I already had a 110 vold recharging cable.",neutral
"This equipment was difficult to set up, very slight adjustments to antenna placement made a huge difference in performance. Also found that weather and time of day affected (source) signal strength making it a complex problem to solve. I ended up running up a 35 foot antenna on the west most corner of my house using a PVC extension and I pretty much always have signal in the house. The antenna can't be connected to metal, the coax must be grounded, there must be at least 15 feet vertical distance from antenna and amp (my personal experience is that 25 verical feet wasn't enough), amp must be located near ceiling and away from electrical wires (in wall or ceiling ... & other EMF generating equipment) and after all that, it sort of works. My source signal is weak so the amplified signal doesn't travel far within my house but at least we can text and talk in one or two rooms of the house. It's expensive but for a family that's used to having cell phone service it's an option worth considering.",neutral
"I purchased this to use at work. I work all day on a PC and like to listen to the music loaded on my BlackBerry. The cord from my ears to my BlackBerry was always getting in my way. I didn't want to be connected by wires to it (I have pulled it off the desk a few times) but I still wanted to be able to skip through my music. The Jabra BT 3030 was exactly what I needed. I wear it around my neck and use retractable ear buds to limit the cord mess. I love being able to pause, play, skip forward or back without having to touch my phone. It even works great to attach my work badge too. The music sounds great. And I have used it for phone calls too, with no complaints. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great way to listen to their music without having to be attached to your music.",positive
"About a month into ownership, the extending microphone quit working and was falling apart. Plantronics was easy to deal with when I inquired about an exchange. They must have felt the product was a little flimsy too, because they replaced the headset with the BackBeat model. While they (the Backbeat) are OK, they're not that great, and the micro usb charger is proprietary (a real pain). Plantronics has some good products out there, but the stereo headsets they make don't seem to be their forte; I'd go with another brand. **************************************** ORIGINAL REVIEW Another home run by Plantronics. I'm using it with an iPhone 3G and a Blackberry 8830. I'm sure there's better sounding stereo headphones out there, but as I'm not a purist or an audiophile, all I can say is they sound great to me. Very well thought out product and seems sturdy. The slide-out microphone feature is great. The convenience of using the 855 as a standard bluetooth headset and then just plugging in the other earpiece when you get to the gym is worth enough to me that I would have gladly paid the original $120-$150 asking price when it first launched; that I got it on Amazon for $55 is just gravy. The fifteen inch cord that plugs the second earpiece in is not just black vinyl - it's covered in a nylon woven fabric that is strong but flexible and isn't tangle-prone. I own several bluetooth headsets and one stereo bluetooth headset, a Jabra BT series over-the-ear/around-the-neck design. The Jabra sounds good too, but it just won't stay in place at all for me. Also, their design makes it hard to set them down; they act like a weeble and wobble all around. May not sound like a big deal, but inevitably, when you go to put them on the bench in the locker room while changing, they roll off to the floor. I've read a few reviews that complain about the fit of this headset and I find it hard to believe. It ships with three sizes of in-the-ear silicone tips and I find them very comfortable. My complaints are minor: A dedicated on-off switch would be nice (Motorola has this on a few headsets and it beats any multi-function button hands down), and the controls are on the small side for a guys hands. Overall, I'm very satisfied with this purchase and would recommend them to anyone.",neutral

As a result, I have nothing to say about other virtues of this apparatus.",negative
"This device I have been using for a year now and it works very well. Microphone placement is very important so plan this part well to be sure that it picks up the least amount of road noise since it is very sensitive. All features that I use including voice dial and standard calling from recent calls and contact list works well. The only thing I ran into is that contacts that are in your phone from social networks such as linked-in or facebook do not sync to this device so you will need to enter these into your phones contact list if you want them on the device. Other than this, fantastic device, handsfree and worry free calling in California. I should mention that if you have a Dodge Caliber (probably others too), it will require an $80 harness for connection to your speakers due to the way that the radio control handles sound to the speakers so check this first before you buy. This added to the cost but the final product was worth the additional time and money. There probably are better devices out there since this came out and I would check these out first but if the price is right, this gets the job done.",positive

"From a functional standpoint, this is the best bluetooth headset that I have owned to date. It is loud and clear, noise cancelling function is very effective, and the voice command capability is brilliant. The problem is that the headset will not stay in my ear. The ear clip worked reasonably well when I first bought this, but the rubber bushing soon after became stretched and would not hold the ear clip in place. I have since tried different methods to keep it from flopping around, but eventually it falls apart. It seems to me that a company capable of designing such a technologically superior device could have come up with a more effective method for keeping it on your head. Let's hope that blueant corrects this with their next release.",neutral

"After looking around in local stores here and seeing the cheaper sleeve cases, I decided to go for this product and pay a little bit extra. I think I should have paid more attention to the picture, since the picture clearly shows a gap between the sleeve and the top of the phone. I was expecting a better fit. Second thing is the ""Exclusive EasyReach system"". It's not that exclusive, since most sleeve cases have this, but the new sleeve I bought after buying this one is much smoother than the ""system"" used in the incipio sleeve case.

"The phone was rated as a new product, yet it acts like a refurbished phone. The product is of a sub-standard material and will NOT last long.

Already - after 1 week's worth of use - the letters on the keyboard are washing out and disappearing. The keyboard is squishy upon touch and the reception and transmission is poor. The phone is cutting out and has poor reception and transmission capability and is hyper-sensitive to ANY power source or wiring within 5ft. to the point and frequently disconnects calls. I am VERY unhappy with this purchase and WILL NOT order from this manufacturer again. My previous Motorola was made in Japan, whereas this one is made in China.

"What a pain. Every time I turned on the Motorola W370 from the time I turn it on to the time it finds the network no matter where I am, it takes a good 1 minute 45 seconds! It never got better - no matter when or where I turned it on, it would take that long before I could make a call. I cannot live with that and complained and complained to Tracfone. Yesterday, after nearly a month going back and forth, I finally was okayed for the option of changing to a comparable phone with them. I had even replaced the SIM card that they sent, but that did not work. They finally concluded that even though this phone is recommended for my zip code, that it just does not work well for me in this zip code. I haven't decided which phone to get yet - they offered the LG225 or the Motorola W376g. Who knows if the same problem would happen again - I hope not! I would still be using my old Tracfone (Motorola 120 - no SIM card), old-fashioned, but the antenna fell after 3 years of use, no idea where all the parts went. Tracfone no longer supported that model so it was put to rest. But what a fantastic phone for me - never had a problem with it and it was a rebuilt one and free with the units I bought. As soon as I turned it on the network came right in. I haven't moved so it is strange that the Motorola W370 takes as long as it does to find the network. This is NOT normal. Otherwise the W370 was fine but I only use my cell phone to call out from when I am not home, but generally I am home. Be so glad when this whole affair is finished.

I have been using the Powerpak Itorch for a few days now and it has already become one of my favorite gadgets. We have two Iphone's and two Ipad's in my home and we are constantly charging them. The Itorch has made this task a much easier process. I generally charge the Itorch on a nightly basis and then just use it throughout the day to charge my devices as they need it. I find it so much easier to charge my Ipad with the Itorch rather than a wall outlet. I can sit on my couch and continue whatever I was doing without having to worry about sitting by the outlet etc. I already own another New Trent charger that I use for backpacking trips and times when I need to be able to charge several times.

"Finally, a PDA, phone, and MP3 player all in one. And the Treo 650 delivers, if it weren't for the bugs! The Palm portions work as you'd expect, the screen is awesome, and it syncs with my Linux box faster and more reliably over Bluetooth ([...] (So I don't care much if the unit can't read Microsucks documents.) The system used to reset itself daily, or sometime require a manual reset when you couldn't turn it off, or on, or when it hung. Most of these resets disappeared when I ran the dbScan software that comes with DateBk5 to remove deleted records. You can get the dbScan software from the DateBk5 site. I read another review here that the 1.20 firmware update helped the stability too. I'll have to try it. The VersaMail application as well as the Bluetooth and Network preferences pages have some usability issues. The VersaMail application reverted to factory defaults--losing my mail--twice over the past six months. The Palm Wireless headset sometimes doesn't pick up calls, but when it does, the sound appears to be pretty good. Wish I could turn up the volume more though. Sharing the same power cord with the Treo is a welcome feature. The phone is surprisingly robust. It's taken a lot of lickings and keeps on ticking. However, it took its last fall last week (and it was a beaut--it leaped out of its case while I was sprinting across a street) which rendered some of the phone operations inoperative. Tip: Don't get the Covertec horizontal pouch case which rotates and dumps the phone nearly every time you get out of the car, or releases the phone when you run. Someone mentioned that the text was hard to read. I'm over 40 and can read the crisp lettering just fine without my glasses. The keyboard is nice too: I could use Grafitti very well (I wrote a trip journal for two months in Grafitti!) but can type a whole lot faster and more accurately with the keyboard. Despite the problems and well-deserved criticism with the phone, I will be replacing my dead unit with another 650. I don't use the phone heavily, so if the 1.20 firmware update improves the stability, I will be content.",positive

"I bought this phone case for my Lumia 820 and overall I'm very satisfied with the product, it fits well and it has thick rubber on the corners to prevent falling damage I guess.

"I have had this phone for 2 months now. First, the Good Size, Call Quality, User Interface, Volume, Virgin pricing plans, web extras. It is very thin and can be stuck in any pocket without making it look like you just shoplifted half the store. The call quality has been excellent, much like my 2 previous phones from sprint were (Virgin runs off of the Sprint PCS network for those who didn't know). The interface is clean and simple for anyone to use. The volume of the call is loud and clear as is the ringer - I have yet to not hear the phone ringing in my pocket (one of my biggest problems with my last Samsung phone). Virgin has really simple pre-paid pricing plans with a well organized and useful website. Virgin offers lots of ringtones and wallpaper online at 2 bucks a pop as well as celebrity voice mail & rescue ringtones. Now, the bad Button size, battery life, built in extras. The buttons are very small and can be difficult to operate if you have large hands (Once the phone book is programmed this becomes much less of an issue). This phone will not stay charged for more than 1 day - even if no calls are made. I have to make sure I charge it every night or else it becomes useless - this is my biggest complaint about this phone. There are hardly any backgrounds or ringtones that come with the phone. I had to go online and pay more for a ringtone than I would for an entire song from iTunes.",neutral
"I have the arm mount (that goes on the window) that comes originally with the device. I guess the arm mount that fits into this bean bag, is a different size arm because the one I have does not fit or slide into place.

"I bought this phone and when it arrived it was a cheap refurb that had problems from the moment I put the sim card in. The Customer service is bad, basically you have to use email to get a RMA Number and then they take their sweet time sending you a RMA form that makes you list all this stupid infomation then you have to send it back to them. I have not gotten a number yet, even after sending them emails to check on the status. STAY AWAY FROM THIS VENDOR.",negative
"The case is great, looks good and does its job... for about three weeks. The first case broke in two weeks time at the clip, Amazon was great about replacing it. The second one broke just after four weeks. I would typically expect a case like this to go for $20 and made of higher quality. But since i'm seeing it being sold for under $10, i'd say its fair to say someone cut serious corners on quality. And here's the kicker, there isn't another case out there, that looks this good and works this well ... that is for the three weeks it will last.",negative
"I am on my third one and love the call quality. I really love the swing out mic that turns the earpiece on and off. You can save a lot of battery life by having it off until you get a call. Swing out the mic and answer the call by the third ring. But, and this is a huge BUT, the swing out mic is also the weak point. The wires in the arm eventually weaken or break. At first it will sound like you are far off and then it might not work at all. As such, I cannot recommend this earpiece to others.",negative
"Sure there are three rings on the male end, but there are only two wires on the inside of the cable and female side. Effect: No volume controls or mic. This will NOT work as an extension for credit card readers. I wish I could offer zero stars.",negative

"Won't stay behind the ear, ear piece won't stay in ear cannal, cuts out and sometimes won't respond at all.

I thought these things were supposed to make my life easier.",negative
"The wall unit shorts out after 2-3 seconds and the car unit is temperamental. I do benefit from having the extra hot sync cable, but the other parts are useless.

"I have never had a Bluetooth headset before the 510. I use it with a Motorola i870 Nextel phone. The headset works great, sometimes it disconnects for a moment and I just press the button on the side of the headset and it reconnects. The talk time is awesome and I have gotten almost 5 hours continuous talk time out of the device. The range isn't too bad I think I can get about 30 feet from my i870. If only my crappy Nextel phone could keep up will the quality of the headset. Since my i870 battery goes dead in like 1 1/2 with the extended batter pack I have to plug it in to charge. However, while it's plugged in I can still use the 510 and wander all over the house and still talk on the phone. It almost replaces the phone if I could dial from it. The best part is that when you get too far away it gets a little static so that you know to come back closer and then the sound quality clears up. Everyone I have spoken with on the headset says it sounds very nice and clear. Overall I would suggest this headset to anyone because it works, it's cheap and it wears extremely comfortable on your ear.",positive

"My husband and I both have this headset. It is absolutely wonderful especially if you have a blackberry. The reception is clear and though when you first see it you think it's big, the 3 earpiece option provides a fit for everyone.

"Haven't used this much, but so far, so good. It seems a little flimsy, but it's held up to my minimal usage. It's also a little difficult to get the phone in and out of the pocket, but that may be a symptom of all arm-band type media holders (I hae always used hip-pack types before). Outside of that, the phone is fully operational while inside through the clear plastic, and I wore it during a downpour (NOT recommended) and my phone remained completely dry.",neutral
"Like so many others, I am on a perpeptual search for the ""perfect"" Bluetooth headset. I want it to slip over my ear quickly, to fit firmly into my ear canal, allow me to hear clearly while I am standing in the midst of a roaring crowd and reproduce my voice perfectly no matter how lousy my connection. Someone on quest like this encounters a lot of disappointment. The Jabra 510 met some of these requirements, but not the critical ones. Hearing the other party often required pressing it into my ear and I often received complaints that I was difficult to hear. Many reviews on the Jawbone have been glowing . . . and some have been downright derogatory. I figured that I might as well try it. The design is visually appealing, but the earband is a piece of bad design. Apparently made of aluminum or some metal alloy, it is relatively inflexible and difficult to place over the ear. One point against. There have also been reports that these earloops are easy to break. There are only two buttons, both of which are hidden. One is relatively easy to find, the other requires a bit of hunting. This second button is also the volume control. Press it a bit too long and you've just turned off Bluetooth and lost your call. The visual indicators for status are sparse, so often you are left guessing as to precisely what status your Jawbone is in. I found that restablishing my Bluetooth connection, which I had accidentally severed, was way more difficult than it had to be. Initial pairing was flawlessly simple, but if you lose your connection while driving on an expressway, for example, trying to reconnect turns you into an accident waiting to happen. Received audio quality is pretty good. Using the standard ear bud, the fit was good, but not perfect. The volume control proved to be hit-or-miss. Sometimes pressing it as the directions specified increased the volume. Sometimes it broke my Bluetooth connection. I tested the voice transmission capability by turning up the television and radio at the same time and calling my own voicemail. I must tell you, the noise cancelling technology works very well. Voice quality is acceptable: we're talking cell phone audio here, not concert hall acoustics. The battery seems to last the specified times, but the proprietary charger connections are not only a bad idea, but stupid as well. While one end of the cable can be plugged into a standard USB slot, the end that attaches to the Jawbone is proprietary. This is just plain dumb. It should be a mini-USB. Instead you have to remember to pack yet one more cable. Is the Jawbone worth the premium price? Kind of doubtful. With other headsets, I've never been unable to complete a phone call, although sometimes I have had a hard time hearing and being understood. The Jawbone does make your voice more intelligible with its noise cancelling abilities. So I guess the determination would be how often you would need to depend on that noise cancelling technology. I am also wary of Aliph's customer support. Many Amazon reviews have remarked on poor build quality, breakage and very poor customer support by the manufacturer. Jerry",positive
"These screen protectors are not for the PSP. Even before opening them to try them, you can see on the packaging that they are for an IPhone. I decided to try one out anyway.

This is a misinterpretation. Does not work. Do not buy unless getting for an IPhone.",negative
"My first phone when I switched to Verizon was the Motorola SLVR L7c, horrible little phone, very little about it was positive. My prior phones have always been Samsung so I went back and have not regretted it. This little phone is cool, compact, very functional, and fun to use. I love the dual hinges and the full qwerty keyboard. Yes, the keys are rather narrow and take some getting used to, but I love the functions. Easy to use, great phone, clear calls, compatible with Acura's HandsFree bluetooth too. My only complaints, my prior Samsung (SCH A900) had a message indicator light that flashed red, this one doesn't, you gotta wake this one up by pressing and holding any one of the side keys when it's closed to see its status. The other thing, don't know if it's a Samsung flaw or Verizon's weirdness, I can't assign different ringers to blocked and unblocked calls. I could with all my other phones but could not with the 2 Verizon phones I've had. Pro's: small but easy to use full keyboard slim profile Con's: no message indicator light Verizon's need to alter their phones' factory software/displays/setting options",positive
"I received on yesterday, read the directions, plugged in to charge and the light was red to indicate it was charging. I tried after a few hours to see if it was charged and nothing.

"Part ONE (the upgrade for folks who HAVE the Jabra BT800): The manufacturer's (free) website has a link to download an UPGRADE to the existing Jabra BT800. This reviewer cautions you to follow the manufacturer's downloading instructions EXPLICITLY. In case you are drunk, stoned, distracted by your Little Darlings, recovering from an all-too-fresh spat with your spouse, or were actually heading out the door before you changed your mind and now wish to ""quickly"" get this upgrade thing over and done with: STOP. Do not proceed until your misguided enthusiam has dissipated and you can PAY ATTENTION, FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS, and WAIT PATIENTLY. The whole idea of an upgrade is to render your Jabra BT800 even more up-to-date than it was when the manufacturer first released it on us. Should you attempt to hurry up the step-by-step process, or should you somehow interrupt the process midway, you DEFEAT the goal. The details are spelled out on the upgrade page for the BT800 on the Jabra site. Most of you do not need to ever ""upgrade"" your BT800; nevertheless, there are advantages: - faster audio transfer for (Sony-)Ericsson phones - faster speech channel handling; the call is transferred to the headset more quickly - faster reaction on key-presses during incoming calls - The missing international prefix ""+"" is displayed in your caller list, thus allowing you to dial out from your Jabra BT800 Part TWO (for folks who want to double-check that their make/model Bluetooth phone is compatible with the BT800 before ordering the BT800 for it): The Jabra website has a Navigation Bar tab entitled ""Support"". On the Support page there is a COMPATIBILITY GUIDE box or hypertext LINK. Slow down; pay attention: you MUST turn on Session Cookies _before_ you click. The Compatibility Guide will STONEWALL you if you try to navigate the three drop-down menus with the Cookies disabled. I myself successfully obtained their Result by setting the Cookie option to ""Prompt"" and rejecting the long-term (year 2020) Cookies from Jabra. Session Cookies ARE A MUST, and you can hopefully delete them from your PC before you leave their site. Should you receive the message ""... are not compatible."", don't order the BT800 for that particular make/model phone. Plantronics (another good-quality manufacturer) has a Compatibility Guide too, but it's not labeled as such: look for ""Will this work with my existing phone?"" on each of the pages that describe a Plantronics device. I'm not taking sides here. BTW, in case you already have a Motorola or Nextel (made by Motorola) phone, I think that your Bluetooth headphone also ought to be a Motorola. Nextel is weird to start with (they use a soon-to-be replaced by Sprint language called iDen), so definitely look before you leap into a purchase of any Bluetooth compatible headphone. Both Motorola and Plantronics are big companies who know what they are doing, yet Jabra seems to have a feature which makes me gravitate towards some Jabra Bluetooth products: I very much like the GEL BUDS and the MINI GELS that go into the ear. The audio is better (no outside noise), and the COMFORT potential (assuming a correct fit) is fantastic. I withheld one star because of the retail cost; I withheld one star because of the overall weight/SIZE (due to all the extra features tacked on to the BT800). In case sound quality is paramount, and the Bluetooth convenience is secondary, do consider an unknown unit made by Plantronics: the MX505. There are four models (Product Variants) to match your make and model phone. It is part of what Plantronics calls the MX500 Series. The boom mike is actually a TUBE (you get two lengths), which is purposely curved and can be pivoted. The end has a windscreen ((""WindSmart"" technology) to dampen rushing wind (open car window). Soundwise, you won't do better. Looks-wise, it IS techie-looking, not a fashion statement. You won't develop as many wrinkles on your face while struggling to hear or be heard, so you will look better than the equipment. As for the decided convenience of Bluetooth, which enables you to function without any mind-body coordination, the MX505 and/or MX510 (Nokia) has you tethered to your device. The cord is NOT automatically retractable into a reel (the Plantronics MX300 corded headset has a good one), so you must work safely, since you are on a ""leash"".",neutral

"I struggled about whether to grade it as a 2 or 3 star. Initially worked better than it does now. The ""DT"" stands for desktop if you haven't researched it thoroughly.

That was the case in year one, now in years 2 - 3, we have to sit within about 4 - 6 feet of it to be of any help. Also be aware that it is not capable of boosting a 4G signal; only up to 3G. I haven't seen any noticeable improvement in my smart phone's internet, which uses 3G and/or 4G signals.",neutral
I purchased the unit for use on a bicycle and it is great to have on a bicycle but beware of the battery life. It will not last for a 3 to 4 hour rides.

"As there are some other excellent reviews here, I am concentrating on what has not been written. Sound quality varies, depending on how you use the headphones. Basically, both comparisons with AM radio and HiFi Sound are more or less true. Here is why. I find the earphones of an excellent quality at low to middle sound levels, delivering sound better than my Koss Porta Pro and on par with Sennheiser PC-150. But this is only true, when the earphones are wired to the source. It is also loud, at 50% PB output level sound get unbearable. Good sensitivity and sound detail. Using the including Bluetooth dongle, quality slips to the level of FM radio. Using it with iPod, which does not offer that good output quality (at least no comparison to my Al PowerBook 1.5GHz), quality slips a bit further. This is partially due to limitation of the Bluetooth and the fact that sound is amplified twice (both in iPod and headset). Further gets worse :(. By connecting vie Bluetooth to the PowerBook, quality does goet to the level of the AM Radio, as Mac currently do not support A2DP Bluetooth profile for improved audio quality. It is really a no go for listening to music, and Skype quality drops to the level of a normal phone. To get it working, however, there is one thing to keep in mind. I guess, Macs do not support another feature of Bluetooth, multi-access. Since I am using headset as a phone headset as well, it is constanly connected to the mobile phone. It seems like macs do not like sharing headsets, so bluetooth on the mobile phone has to be switched off. Otherwise, no problem whatsoever. Dongle-phone (SONY Ericsson K750i) combination works perfect and is REALLY cool stuff. It switches sources, once you get a call and then switches back to the iPod. Basically, I am keeping the headset, as getting rid of the wires on the go is worth the sound quality penalty. For a good quality, 3.5 mm jack is the only option for some time to come, in my opinion. So, this is an awesome product, well designed, very well built. If it suffers some quality issues, it is actually due to the limitations of the technology, not the product. I had no problems with charging, as did some other users. Another batch maybe :p. Accordingly, 5 stars for the product, 1 star penalty for inperfect technology (Bluetooth and Mac), 4 Stars in total. Oh! One annoying thing, there is a blinking blue ring light on the right earphone. At night it is really bright, so you'll end up looking like a lighthouse. During the day it is not that obvious. Still annoying, as I would prefer to use my cool headset rather discreetely.",positive
"It functionally works, so I can't complain. I therefore give it 3 stars to be neutral. For the price, it's not such a bad deal. Pros: Holds my iPhone securely in the bracket Cons: Cord too short, suction cup is cumbersome to attach and release as you rotate a knob that's not designed for a quick mount or release. The range is limited, in that the crane is short in length and will not extend or swing around for adjustment. The car charger I bought of this brand also died after 2 weeks of use in my car. I went to the Apple store and bought a nice solid gooseneck that plugs right into my car charger to charge the battery, hook up to my stereo speakers, and does not obscure the view of the windshield as the hard flexible gooseneck extends vertically up from the charger and floats the device solidly in air instead. It even has an extra outlet for USB port to charge another device simultaneously. I guess I should have just gone for the grand package rather than piecing together multiple inexpensive products that was inevitable to be replaced for an avid user like myself.",neutral

"This is a nice product, a very nice phone (or should I say ""very nice ALL-IN-ONE PHONE""?), I gotta tell you, it worth every penny, first days I was a little upset because I didn't get into it, but now... seems to be a nice solution for a lot of things, what I have installed in my AIO PHONE: 1. Skype 2. MSN 3. Office Viewer 4. Lots of games (metal gear solid acid for mobiles, fifa, etc) 5. Internet using WiFi corporate network (you can specify the type of encryption, open/shared, IPV4 y IPV6, sutnet, gateways and DNSs) 6. Yahoo Chat 7. Google Talk 8. Bluetooth connectivity is really awesome 9. Opera Mini and the built-in brower (both are good) 10. PDF Reader (this is nice if you need to open/read something while you're traveling) 11. You can synchronize it with Windows Media Player what is nice too, because is easy to find WMP already installed in your computer (against the ipod/iphone-itunes, you have to download it and is a little tricky) 12. ETC. Of course, not everything is PINK, and has some cons: 1. Is just a bit bigger and heavier than the w810, but if you think you're getting WiFi, you forget that. 2. I guess... is easier to use a sony ericsson, but every feature included in the N81 worth to learn something new. 3. The storage (8gb) is built-in, and it has not any slot to expand the capacity, but again, I guess 8gb is enough space for applications, games and music. 4. Since I'm an IT guy, I like to keep my gadgets UP-TO-DATE, but the Software updater is not available for Windows Vista, so, I gotta wait the release, of course, it does not means the phone does not work, but sometimes when you update your software, some enhancements in performance and new features are included, the updater is only supported by Windows XP. 5. The realplayer is the player included with the phone, and only plays mp4 and 3gp, the resolution on the screen is nice, but, sometimes, when you're trying to watch videos from YouTube.com (yes, you can watch streaming video too) the player get fuzzy... and you should close and open again the video in order to get a better display. That's my experience with the N81 8GB, I hope it will be useful for you. BR",positive
I am protesting the Amazon Price Gouge occurring with many items added to my cart. The price for this item increased by $21+ overnight! I will not buy an item when this happens. This seems to happen with a LOT of items being added to my cart. Update: Price dropped to $104.93 now.,neutral
"The only reason I refused to upgrade to a bluetooth headset and never used it because that the other party would always complain that I do not sound good. The fidelity was absent. Jawbone 2 eliminates this problem and I use headset now during driving. The other party does not sound good to me. The caller is legible but I do not like it as the sound is to robotic. Also the fit needs to be improved big time and the controls require getting used too. At $129 price tag, you expect everything to be great which is not the case. There should also be a storage case to stow it away safely in pocket when not in use. One good thing though, at least I use a headset when needed.",neutral

I was hoping the Voyager 855 would serve double-duty and replace both headset and headphones while also giving me the convenience of bluetooth wireless connectivity to my phone, laptop, and music player. The build quality of the Voyager 855 is excellent. The headset is well put together, the buttons are easy to use, and the earbuds and ear hook are easy to adjust and fit comfortably. I have one complaint with the cord that connects the stereo earbud; if I turn my head, I can hear the cord rubbing against the back of my shirt or neck quite loudly as the vibrations are transmitted directly into my ear. The call quality of the Voyager 855 is also excellent, much better than the Samsung WEP200. There is practically no difference audible to me or the other listener when using the headset. The sliding boom brings the microphone closer to my mouth so that I'm still clearly audible and the earbud delivers acceptable sound to my ear. The music quality, however, leaves much to be desired. There is practically no bass to speak of and the sound is generally tinny and weak. It sounds like I'm listening to music through a telephone. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised, but I was hoping that a headset advertised for music playback would be a cut above the typical headset sound quality.

"When you're constantly on the go like me, sometimes you don't even get 2 minutes to sit down and charge your phone, iPod, or iPad properly. This is where the New Trent iTorch IMP52D comes in. With this external battery I only have worry about getting the battery charged itself instead of worrying that I have to charge 12 different electronics. I am love with the useful features it has such as the flashlight and laser pointer (very useful for school presentations). I was able to get my iPhone 4S (fully), iPod 4th Gen (fully), and iPad 2 (partially) charged from below 25% within about 6 hours before it started running out of juice. Ahh Factors: -Very portable size (looks and feels nice) -Charges up quickly (about 4 hours) -Laser pointer -Flashlight Ehh Factors: -Somewhat confusing to turn on the flashlight and laser pointer My only minor complaint with this product is remembering how long I have to hold the button to turn on the laser pointer or flashlight. If you press it once (quickly) it will turn on the laser light. Press it again and it turns off the laser. Press and hold it for 2 seconds to turn it on and start charging and hold it for 3 seconds to turn on the flashlight. It does take some time to get used to it but overall nothing to cry over for such a convenient and useful product.",positive

If you cannot try the ear bud before you purchase it, avoid this product.",negative
"We've slowly been upgrading the tree stands that we use for deer hunting and recently started dropping batteries in with solar panels to top them off. The primary use has been to wire in some lighting to make it easier to get set up in the morning and pack up in the evening. But, it gives the added benefit of having 12v DC power available for topping off phones, iPods, or even running an iPad or netbook like my uncle likes to do during the long mid-day hours when the deer don't move around as much. Of all the various options I found to add power ports to the tree stands that I looked at this was by far the easiest I could find. I was easily able to splice two of these into the 12v power line I have coming off the battery and then use a couple of pipe straps to hold them in place. It may not be the prettiest piece of wiring ever, but hey I have power in my tree stand now.",positive

After reconferming my address (which was correctly placed in the original order), I checked the UPS delivery website and with Amazon. The latest up to date information they had was that the order never got sent to my address in Sacramento, CA. In fact it was sent to a warehouse in New York and never left. I am extremely upset at the fact that not only did I never receive my ordered product, but I was lied to by the customer service.

"I bought this headset for my motorola e815 phone and it paired nicely with it. However I returned it after much testing for 3 days. Here are my pros and cons: Pros: - Great design. - The retractable boom is great because you can turn the headset on and off quickly. - The buttons work just fine and are easy to get used to. - It is light and comfortable to wear for long periods of time. Cons: - ECHO ECHO ECHO... Everyone I talked to (on landlines and cell phones) complained about the echo. I had to turn the volume almost off before they stopped hearing it, then I could not hear them... - Volume is terrible. Even at full volume it is difficult to hear the other person. Forget using it in the car or in a noisy environment. - Fits the ear very loosely and feels like it is going to fall off. The earpiece tends to move around and get out of position with any head movement. Overall, it is not worth any price (well, maybe $20 or less) because you can't have a decent conversation with the headset. You can't hear the other party and they hear themselves twice.",negative

"Upgraded from a Razr v3 to this. It was a good move. The handling will take some getting used to (slider vs. other). You'll have to change the settings around to make the phone easier for you. But it has alot of capabilities. Drawbacks is theres a button for ""music"". What? It's great that it has MP3 capability, but I'll use my phone for a text message before music. I wish that button was for text or camera even. The slider is smooth. The phone is pretty solid. I have a feeling you can bang it around a little and still have it work properly. Battery life seems strong. Reception is fine so far. Buttons are smooth, although one big pad instead of seperate buttons. Overall I think this phone is very good. Once you get past the initial setup (IE setting your address book, hot buttons, text style, ring tones and volumes) and once you get past the sliding action (i'm used to a flip phone) this will be a seriously powerful and fun phone to use. lots of extra stuff like mp3, video and camera for those who like the tech stuff. but fully functional to use just as a regular phone like I do. I recommend this phone, as it's not too expensive and works well.",positive
"The biggest complaint about this case, is that with the swivel system, the pouch stuck out way too far. It snagged on everything. This was the eventual reason for its breaking.

To improve this, the unit would probably need to be larger, but it's a drag to have to use the reading glasses to see the keys.",positive
"Pros: This is a great bluetooth if you want stereo for music or for conversations in loud places. Whenever I had trouble hearing I use both buds. It blocks out background sound so I can hear fine and the mic is so good it only picks up my voice (as long as the volume isn't set too loud). Worst case in really loud environments I have to hold the mic near my mouth. Sometimes I use it at work just to block out loud sounds. Works just as goood as the earplugs we use hear and Thy're easier to put on and take off. It's great for me because I don't like to walk around with a device in my ear or have to explain to people that I'm on the phone and not talking to them. Also, If your driving you don't have to fumble around to look for it because it just hangs on your neck. Works great with my Sony Ericson W580i and my bluetooth laptop. It accesses phone contact book and recent calls or music playing. Displays time too. One button music play, one button phone answer with caller ID. name shows just like you have it saved on your phone. Cons: It would be nice if I could plug in another set of head phones. Actually I really want to plug into my home theater so I can remotely send the music from my phone. Overall: Great product. Already bought a second one. I made the mistake of thinking it could handle a hot sauna room. It ruined the rubber. But that would have happened to any earphone I'd of used.",positive
"First of all, it was at least functional, until we upgraded to Snow Leopard. Now you can't even use it with Skype on a Mac. The utilities are cumbersome. Why does it only hold 200 phone numbers? Why that small limit? If you have more in your address book, which many folks will, it just cuts off. So it's only partly functional. The product was so poorly constructed that I've already had to have a part replaced. This after only very mild usage. You are really a third class citizen here on your Mac. They claim to support it, but that's a very hollow promise. I just don't recommend this device. It's not a good value for your money, even with a PC. With a Mac, it's 100% useless. And their support is not too helpful either. Frustrating.",negative
"Let me first say that I really wanted to like this headset. The features were amazing. It has a LCD for caller ID, vibrate mode, and it's pretty small. However, as much as I wanted to like this headset I couldn't overcome the discomfort of wearing it. I mean, the wrap around plastic earpiece is pretty stiff and puts quite a bit of pressure on the ear. My ear would start to hurt after 30 minutes of wearing it. I think it's also very heavy. If they could have gotten these features into a lighter package, I would have loved it. I guess I'll have to wait for the next generation from Jabbra. A couple of other issues with the headset. You get quite a bit of static if you walk away from the phone into a room. The caller won't hear it, but you do on your end. Actually most people I talk to say they hear me very clearly with this headset. Another problem is it does flop if you move your head around b/c of the weight of this thing. I read the review and figured it's not going to be a problem with me, but if I lie down and try to talk to people, it flops away from my face and people complain I sound muffled or garbled. I'm going to return this and take my chances with another headset. I'm really going to miss the LCD display, but comfort must come first.",neutral

"I bought the Nuvi at a great price at Amazon ($134.00 & free shipping), so I didn't expect top of the line features or performance. I must say that I am very pleased with the unit. The only disappointment was the need to purchase and download the City Navigator program for Mexican cities. I had hoped that this would be included, since the product had been advertised as a ""Nuvi 200 Mexico"". After several tries with extremely long waits (25 min)--I finally got to talk to a real person on their support line. He explained that my unit has Mexican highways, but for city navigating, I would have to purchase the additional City Navigator program for $49.95 The preinstalled highway maps are not at all helpful, since they refer to highway numbers which are rarely indicated with signage. And of course, once you enter a city of any size, you need specific instructions to thread your way through the disorder-- and lack of signage-- to continue on the highway you want for your particular destination. This was completely lacking until I did the City Navigator download. Other small details: the unit does not distinguish one-way streets, and can route you heading the wrong way on a one-way street. When doing a search for a city with a long name, such as San Miguel de Allende (21 letters and spaces) you have to type in more than 15 letters before the unit kicks in, and provides the name. I cannot understand why the recognition does not come sooner on such a long name if it is a repeated city search. There are many hidden features which are helpful and fun that I am still becoming familiar with. Overall this is a great entry-level product, and I am enjoying it very much.",positive
"**************** TWO WEEK UPDATE **************** The info below under 'Original Review' is just that.....the original review......this is a two (to three) week update after having the phone and integrating it into my life. The camera is workable at best. Both the still and video cameras should be upgraded in the next update and could have been upgraded in the move from 600 to 650. Still functional though. The mpeg viewer works great. I downloaded a little mpeg clip through the palm install tool and it played perfectly with relatively good clarity. This is a nice feature....... The phone itself works fine with no problems and the programmable buttons have worked well since I set them all up. I had a Treo 300 a couple years back and this phone works functionally better....... Versamail continues to be my favorite software installed. I have used it daily and have both mine and my wife's bellsouth.net accounts set up and functioning well. Haven't really noticed any major glitches in it. I have downloaded a couple games over the web into the memory of the palm apps and that worked really well. In addition, I've installed a couple from the desktop with the same results. Functionally, it's a pretty smooth process that is working well..... I really like the buttons and thumbpad and have progressed to where I can do most if not all the functions of the phone without having to pull out the stylus. At first, I thought I'd miss the Graffitti functionality of my Sony Clie NX70 but I do not. The keyboard works well except for my large clumsy fingers and they're starting to figure it out pretty well. Only thing I've noticed on that is when sending messages with Versamail, there doesn't seem to be any great rules for when it auto capitalizes words. That's pretty nit-picky though.........

If you complain about this item and try to return it, my guess is you won't get your money back. Go to an authorized dealer, you're better off. I read somewhere online that if the samsung wep500 has a ear hook in it , it's not real. The hologram sticker on the box wasn't real either, it was a black and white circle already a part of the box, looks like they photo copied the front of the box. t is extremely obvious that this is NOT a genuine product.",negative

"Life with the iTorch 5200 is VERY easy for someone on the go. Ive had it for at least a year. The charger is pocket size. It keeps at least 3 full charges for my iphone 4 or 5 (I upgraded), but thats not all... it also charges my iPad mini air and my Jaybird headphones! THATS RIGHT!!... if you have a USB connection, you are going to get your device charged. Even better is that it doesnt weigh anything. If its in my work bag, backpack on a hike, or in my kid's diaper bag... I don't have to worry about if my stuff has been charged. WAIT theres more! Charging the iTorch 5200 only takes 30-40 min. I haven't timed it but considering it taked my iphone and ipad at least an hour to to charge, time well spent! What are you waiting for... buy it.

"The Garmin Mobile XT comes on a 2GB micro SD card with adapters for mini and the full size card included. The software is locked to the supplied card. This is very convinient if you do not plan to use your SD card slot on your phone for anything but the Garmin Mobile XT. It proofes the product useless if you actually want to use it in order to save for instance pictures, videos, email or music on your SD card since then you need to swap those tiny cards each time you want to use the Garmin Mobile XT. Unfortunately if you do this too often the little contacts will break and you cannot use either card. Or you do not have the card handy when you need it. Garmin customer service refuses to give out an unlock code, which would make it possible to move the files from the to 3/4 full 2GB card, which ships with the Garmin Mobile XT, to something like a 4GB or 8GB card. Bottom line, this product for all practical matters is uselss. I recommend using your mobile phone provider's subscription GPS service or another GPS software such as Tomtom.",negative

"I'm sure this could be a good product, but mine, however, was not. My pack would charge by itself, but it would never charge the phone. The phone just did not seem to recognize the battery pack, and honestly, seemed to drain my phone's battery more quickly. The most disappointing aspect of this purchase (though partly my own fault for not testing prior) was that I bought this in anticipation of using it on a long cross-country flight. When I realized on the flight that it didn't work, I had to cease use of my phone all together for fear I wouldn't be able to make any calls once I arrived at my destination. I know that the problem is with the battery pack and not my phone as I purchased a MacAlly battery pack while at my destination for the flight home. It worked wonderfully.",negative

"Normally when a 3G-capable Nokia is advertised by Amazon as being the U.S. version, that means it is designed to operate on the North American 3G networks. Sadly that is not the case with this phone. It is not 3G-capable in North America. The only thing U.S.-oriented about it is the warranty and the charger. I was hoping that the ""Asia/Europe 3G compatibility"" in the description was a leftover from the non-U.S.-model description, but after receiving one I can verify that that statement is accurate. Very disappointing. Come on, Nokia, where is our real U.S. model?",neutral

"I previously had a regular cell phone with Cingular. Though I was quite happy with Cingular's service, I was really attracted to the idea of the Sidekick, since it could do web and had (or so they promised) both AOL and Yahoo IM which is only available through Tmobile so I switched. That and the qwerty keyboard, ..I never could enter stuff easily on a Palm, and forget trying to type actual words on a regular phone pad, maybe I""m too old for that. This looked easier. So its good good and bad points...the phone itself is pretty nifty. The keyboard is very easy to use and I can type pretty fast on it. Not 80 wpm but not bad. You will see people complaign that the ALT key is not backlit which is true, but it hasn't been a problem so far. Its not a nice little notepad and calendar feature. The screen is nice and clear. Its really cool having all this stuff in one phone. And oh, they don't mention it anywhere, but it makes a darned handy flashlight. The screen is pretty bright, and you can also press =F and get it to just be a flashlight. The down side is the marketing makes it out to be much better than it really is. Browsing is..so so. You can get to a lot more sites than I expected, but it doesn't do Javascript, which a lot of sites rely on to work. For example I can read posts on a popular blog site but not update. Most of the time browsing is slllllow. I wasn't expecting T-1 speed, I know its a phone and all, but was just hoping for the speed of my old 56 modem, but its not even that fast. Its - go and get a cup of coffee and come back - speed. But, I got a little majong game on it, so I enter the page I want, and to play majong till it blinks that its ready. Its not fast, but being able to look up the address of a restaurant from the parking lot of Target is pretty darn handy. And oh its got its own email acct too which works okay. No bells and whistles but it works. The camera sucks..I mean I wasn't expecting much at all, but its so bad I could do better with crayons. Seriously tanks. But hey I didn't buy it for the camera. What I DID buy it for though, and the reason I gave this a 3 despite the niftiness of the phone, was YAHOO IM. I was *told* by t-mobile both on the phone and in person at the store, that sure, it had yahoo IM, you just have to download it. It advertises this on their site and on the box. 90% of my friends are on Yahoo not AOL. Well as it turns out you CAN download it, but then..trying to actually IM on it is nearly impossible. It disconnects you VERY frequently with no notice or indication whatsoever for about 10-15 minutes. It disconnects easily every 5 minutes. If you check the sidekick forum on the hiptop danger site (the people who make the gadget) you will see its a very very common issue. Despite this issue being so common I've tried to contact T-mobile repeatedly and they were utterly unresponsive, and insisted they could not help, it was not supported by them I had to contact yahoo. They gave me no info to do so. I kept telling them THEY said it was included but they say as it wasn't preinstalled its not supported. What?? So I finally found a Yahoo help email buried in their site and emailed them, and now THEY say its not supported either!!! (and more to that effect). That the only thing supported is the mobile.yahoo.com site, which doesn't quite work either. So even though its advertised and what I paid for, it works well only maybe 5% of the time and neither Tmobile or Yahoo want anything to do with resolving the issue. THe AOL IM works fairly well, but not yahoo. But I don't know anyone on AOL so that doesn't help. MSN btw is totally not available but at least that I knew going in. As far as signal strength goes, its so so. The phone is fairly consistently all the bars where I live, but it still is more staticy and cuts out more than cingular did (on the old network not the new one I had an OLD phone). The data service is spotty. It works maybe 75% of the time. Doesn't work in my house at all. But luckily its the 75% of the time I need it to work so its good enough on that count. And oh..its a bit bulky for a phone, but not bad when you get used to it, and its got a handy speaker. THe speaker has a bit of a delay, but the sound quality isn't bad. SO the sidekick in theory is really neat. I'd love to see where this type of gadget is in a couple years. But right now..ARGH.. its still got some bugs and Tmobile apparently does not care one bit about its customers and trying to resolve these things. THey have their 200 and me in a contract, so I guess that's that as far as they are concerned. If I had to do it over again I'd probably get a regular Cingular phone and one of those Ogos for the IM. Its *got* to work better, cause on the Sidekick it doesn't work at all. If you just want basic web, a phone, and aol then get it. If you want Yahoo IM, definately look elsewhere.",neutral
Sounds great. I switched the ear buds to the larger ones supplied and it fits beautifully and is quite comfortable for long periods. What lets it down is its reception - any kind of RF interference causes it to cut out incessantly which is very annoying if you're listening to music and makes phonecalls impossible. The only remedy is to hold the thing no more than 12 inches from the phone if you're in an area with a lot of RF noise (other wireless and bluetooth gadgets seem to block its signal) If you're wearing an armband or a backpack with a phone pocket built into the straps then you're set. Even having my phone in the top pocket of my shirt wasn't good enough outside. Indoors I can walk easily 8m away from it and it's crystal clear. I will say this - if you live in NY don't bother. I bought mine there and it just wasn't up to going outside. If you live (as I do) in Australia though where there isn't quite so much signal interference in the major cities then it's ok in most places. Still have to keep the phone close to the head set but the problem isn't as extreme.,neutral

"I have a small shower stand and I was looking for a shower head with both height and flexibility. I needed to be able to push the shower head close to the wall while maintaining height so I could have enough space to shampoo, soap, etc. without banging into the walls. For that, this product works perfectly, thanks to the two pivot points and fairly short arm. I'm giving it only 3 stars because it really wastes a lot of water. Surely, the company could have designed a product with the same flexibility but with consideration given to conserving an incredibly valuable and increasingly scarce resource.",neutral
"I bought this product to transfer photos from an older LG phone. Unfortunately that didn't work but that has nothing to do with the cable, but the phone itself.

The cord still works, but I'll have to fix it with electrical tape if I want to try to use it again. So either be very careful handling this cord, or perhaps find one that costs a bit more and might be more sturdy.",neutral

The earbuds would fall if you don't wear them over the ear.

It keeps losing the signal if there's anything in between the phone and the headset pendant. I'm not sure if it's my phone or the headset but I have a S.E. W710 walkman phone.

"This set is great for the price, except that I find it a bit uncomfortable to wear. At first I thought that my ears were too big, so I gave it to my husband who has normal sized ears. Well, he found it uncofortable to wear as well, so he keeps it in his pocket. He actually says that it hurts his ear when he wears it regularly, and when he does put it on his ear, it dangles. The sound quality is good, but to agree with a previous poster, you do have to speak a bit louder for your party to hear you well. You can't beat the price though.

I have this case which came with my no-longer-used Neat Receipt Professional (Neat Receipts charges for a patch just to use it on my new computer that runs on Windows 7 so I opted to get a new scanner from a company that does not charge to upgrade). It is simply a hard case that you can replace with any number of cases available at an organizer store. The case is not particularly specially built. It is similar to the hard case that encases some sunglasses. It has a flap that separates the unit from the cable it comes with. All you have to do is purchase a hard case at the drug store that for a couple of dollars and then place a good cushion such as dusting cloth or towel. Even a small pouch will do as you simply can roll a towel around the hardware. In my case my Neat Receipts Professional hardware did not last regardless of the care I took. I kept it in this case but it eventually succomed to the normal use I gave it. So don't bother spending the exorbitent price for a case as it may not matter in the long run.,negative
"I read the advice here before I bought this. Amazon has the best price i could find on it, and I spent 1.5 hours goggling prices. It is absolutely essential to get the jabra eargels with this, the partnumber is listed in a prior review, from Verizon store. This makes it fit the ear almost perfectly. Failure to do so will make you very very unhappy! One issue was bending the wire to the correct conformation to loop on my ear and position the unit in the ear canal. I suggest starting with the smaller loop wires, as they are easier to bend to shape. Twice already I've gone around looking for my headset only to realize i already had it in my ear! I guess that says it all for comfort. I haven't had any other experience w/ bluetooth devices, but no one has complained about hearing me even in the most crowded noisy places, so it looks like noise assassin lives up to it's billing. The thing I like best about this is hands free operation. I can talk to people while I'm working on my other computer or doing other tasks, and I have no problems getting things done whilst talking, unlike the cramped neck hold it in place that I used to have trying to hold a microhand set to my ear w/ my neck So I gave it five stars because I couldn't imagine what else i'd need in a headset, and I recommend it to my friends.",positive

"Its an ok phone that would be my starting title! why is this, its because the phone its relatively a good phone but you cant compare it to an iPhone after using an iPhone you are just expecting the same features as the iPhone.

Youtube works and you can see it ok but not as good as the os from mac that is installed in the iPhone, btw i bought this phone because i was sick and tired of doing workarounds to my hacked iphone so i could use it here in the Republic of Panama. This is a great phone when we talk about the wifi which it gives you a good signal but this phone is not so user friendly and is kinda hard for a person to set it up to make it look like its part of you. This phone has great games though, the screen is great and the 2 megapixels are great! it has great features as video, video calls, night mode, etc!

I just got it today and I tried it out. So Far its a pretty good fit on my ear cause not a lot of head set fits on your ear anyways.

"I really want to like this headset. The battery life is excellent, the Bluetooth performance is outstandingly good, with excellent range and good performance no matter where I put my phone on my person. The main feature -- the noise cancelation -- works as advertised. Callers say I come through very clearly, even if there's significant background noise. Now for the reasons I'm returning it: 1) The headset is *extremely* sensitive to wind. In conditions where other headsets I've used (Treo, B&O EarSet 2) would pick up a little wind but remain usable, the Jawbone is unusable. People on the other end ask me to call them back or hang up because the wind noise is so loud and they can't understand what I'm saying. I don't know for certain, but I suspect that the fancy enclosure with all its holes is at fault, since it can pick up wind from almost any direction. 2) Incoming voice quality is poor. People to whom I'm speaking sound to me like pale renditions of their natural voices. Somewhat tinny and one-dimensional. And, the only time I've ever noticed the Jawbone's supposed automatic boost in incoming volume happen is when there's so much wind noise that the other person can't hear me. 3) Fit is extremely difficult. The ear loop mechanism includes a clever little spring system that is intended, I suppose, to ensure that the contact microphone stays against your cheek. However, I found that it tended to act to lever the earpiece out of my ear, so that the already-tinny sound quality became even worse. This is in stark contrast to the B&O, whose adjustability and fit are spectacular. 4) Non-standard charging cable is annoying and inconvenient. I wish they had just used a mini-USB cable like a number of other headsets are using. I already carry such a cable with me in my bag, so I would always be equipped for a charge. Long story short: what I really need is a headset that will work in normal conditions. Military noise cancelation technology that will allow me to stand right in front of a boom box and have the person on the other end hear almost nothing but my own voice is very neat. However, if that same person can't stand to speak to me while I walk from my car into a store in a breeze, then the headset is useless. I hope that Aliph will make a new generation product that addresses my issues above.",neutral

"Fits the iPhone extremely well and provides good protection. I dropped my iPhone a day after I got it because it's so slippery when you're taking it out of a pocket. With this case it would never have happened. There are cutouts for the camera, headphone jack, speakers/mic, connector, silence switch, proximity sensor, and earphone. Everything else is covered. It came with a screen protector which was pretty easy to get one. My only complaint is how much dust and lint the case attracts. It also covers up so much of the iPhone that it makes it a bit generic looking.",neutral

"The Razr phone is a great marketing blitz. It's about as thin as a PDA, but not quite. It's actually thicker than my palm pilot. But the RAZR is also about the same SIZE (height/width) as my PDA. So if you want to carry around a slightly thicker version of your PDA and call it a phone, then the RAZR is the phone for you. Otherwise I strongly recommend looking at other phones, such as the Samsung 335, which easily slips into your pocket without being noticed.",negative

"Just as others here have said, these headphones are really uncomfortable. I wear these sometime at work to drown out the office while I work, but I can't keep them on for very long because they get very warm on my head and they press my ears down to the point that it gets painful. I also feel ridiculous when I wear them because they look odd... to say the least. On a good note, battery life is pretty good, and while I'm not an audiophile, the sound compares well with my Bose TriPort In-Ear Headphones.",neutral
"I originally ordered a nuvi 600 series, and I fell in love with the product for its bluetooth capability. However, I recently changed careers and needed a treo phone for my work. When I tried to sync the nuvi with the treo 700wx, I was unsuccessful. In calling Garmin they said that if I was patient, they would probably be releasing some software to deal with the issue in the coming weeks. Well, when spending that much money, I'm not that patient. So, I purchased a car with bluetooth capabilty and decided instead to purchase the newest nuvi 200 for its simplicity and small design. When I got the product, it worked well for the first 24 hours. It then repeatedly locked up. I spoke with Garmin, and they instructed me to do a hard reset, which I performed. The product worked for about 2 hours until I parked in a parking garage. When I left the garage, it took about 10-15minutes for the nuvi to find any satellites. I have dealt with this same problem for the last two weeks. I am now sending the nuvi back to purchase a better unit with an antenna, the most likely problem with this nuvi 200. If you plan on using this nuvi for quickly accessing street navigation in a car, I highly discourage you.",negative
"I previously had one of those neoprene covers for my treo which worked out ok til the plastic belt clip broke off, though that also made the phone pretty bulky. So I was looking for more of a case which the phone could slip in and out off for my next case... this has worked out well so far. The material feels relatively nice and not real cheap.... only complaint is about the clip itself, which was mentioned in some other reviews- it can be hard to get on over some belts - for example I have a leather weaved belt which is a little thicker than a standard belt, and it is a bit difficult to get the clip on that belt. My other belts which are thinner, there is no problem. Overall though I have been fairly satisfied.",positive

"I have only been using it for a few months and it is swelling up already. Even worse, it is bending the phone's screen making it not water resistant anymore. If I hadn't discovered it sooner, the bulging battery would have cracked the screen already. The phone is still usable but now the screen sometimes does random flashes. I am going to contact them for replacement/refund. Even if everything is going to go smoothly, I will still end up with a damaged phone. Ugh... UPDATE: When I contacted them, they responded quickly with an offer to send a replacement. They shipped it right after I responded. I am editing my review to increase the rating to 3 stars for good customer service, but can not go higher since my phone has already been damaged. A good battery should never swell up or explode under normal usage. I am keeping my fingers crossed, hoping the replacement battery would not swell up again.",neutral

"This made a huge difference in areas of marginal signal in Montana and Glacier NP, Yellowstone NP and Grand Teton NP and other places on our trip. The connections do get hot as mentioned by other reviewers but it can be handled without burning you. I didn't see any improvement in the DFW Texas area but we have a good signal so it's not really necessary. As mentioned by others, it can't boost a signal that's not there so no service means no service. It worked well on my Iphone 6S in an Otter Box. If you're in an area with weak signal, it's well worth the cost.",positive

"This is one of those devices that you don't know you need until you have it. Between using our phones for personal and business, and also having our kids play games, we find that we can't make it through the day without charging our phone. And since we're always on the go, the iTorch has been the perfect accessory for keeping our devices charged and ready to go. Usually when we take long trips with our friends and family, someone is always asking for a wall charger and then they have to find an outlet to use. Now we can just keep this in our bag and plug our phone in and keep going. It does come with a red laser pointer and flashlight, which are cool features. I haven't used the laser pointer for anything practical yet, but the flash light has been useful more than I had expected. This is also a very small and slick looking device. It has caught the attention of many passer byers and it's very easy to tote around. This does not come with a wall charger though, just 2 USB cables and a carry bag. If you have a phone or any other mobile device that charges via USB, you need this!",positive
"Works as advertised. Protects your Blackberry from nicks and scratches. Provides better grip. One caveat; If you put this in your pocket it tends to ""grab"" fabric, so it's hard to retrieve. Also, collects some lint, but it's easily washable. Otherwise, a good product for the money.",neutral

"Originally using the Wii on a 720p rear projection Panasonic for viewing Netflix offerings, I was using was the standard RCA cable. I purchased the Wii HD Pro Component Cable in hopes of a significant difference in picture and/or sound quality. So far, the improvement has been slight at best. The minimal improvement may be due to the type of TV I am using. However, the price for the Wii HD Pro Component Cable is very reasonable and may be worth the risk-reward tradeoff, especially if your TV is of higher quality picture quality output. Functionally, the cable works fine.",neutral
"I just returned my T-Mobile wing after a week and a half of solid use. It had a lot of strong points but some major drawbacks ruined the deal. First, those shopping for a device like this are probably looking for a fairly quick data connection. I'm sad to say that T-mobile just isn't up to par with any other, major carrier when it comes to data speeds. It's not a trivial kinda of difference eitther. Verizon has speeds on their phones that are nearly as fast or faster than DSL. With this phone it's barely comparable to a dial-up modem. Forget about Skype, forget about streaming video. It just doesn't happen at those speeds. From a business perspective this device is very solid. Windows Mobile 6.0 offers a few crucial changes over 5.0 but the applications are what won me over. It's nearly a fully functional desktop version of Excel in this bad boy. The version of Word is top of the line as well. Outlook functionality is stellar, and... it even browses Sharepoint sites (with some limitations). As far as the physical device itself, I have some gripes. When using it horizontally with the keyboard slid open, the screen feels very fragile and the device feels fragile over all in your hands when using it this way. I could predict that the sliding functionality would break in the very near future.. .it didn't feel sturdy in that actiona t all. The keyboard is virtually flat, which sucks if you are typing anything other than an extremely quick text. There is no 3.5mm audio jack, it's USB and Bluetooth only. That' sunfortunate because this thing is just about the right size to replace your iPod with, and with memory cards getting as big as they are it's not such a bad alternative. Plus the Win Media Player is very cool and very comprehensitve on this guy. It can be controlled from the home menu The overall feel of the device is great. The case is not smooth and plasticy, it's textured and has a soft feel that would obviously show fewer nicks and dings than your standard PDA. Also, just in case you wondered, the color is not as bad as it appears online. It's a very deep, dark, bluish-purple with a metallic sheen. I can see this device having serious merit for somebody with smaller hands since it isn't that much longer than a RAZR. In the end I sent the device back because it's Wi-Fi module failed. Let me tell you this up front... T-Mobile, not very good at technical troubleshooting. Wouldn't recommend you even bother. I made it through 3 levels of Technical support for the guy to tell me that it must be my wireless setup, despite the fact that my friend was able to connect with his T-Mobile Dash, and the Wing wasn't able to connect to ANY wi-fi connection after the first day. That's T-mobile though, I doubt you'll have success troubleshooting with any carrier on that note. The real story here is that mine was prone to defects within 48 hours of standard use. Overall, I'd recommend it. I'm sure they would have recalled the device by now if everybody was having the wi-fi issues so I guess that's a fairly safe bet. I wasn't able to find evidence of mass defect for wi-fi capabilities on the net. Make sure that you are comfortable with the feel of this device when it's open and the keyboard is in use before you commit to it!",neutral
This is really a great headset in terms of sound quality and overall. The noise cancelling/wind reduction feature makes a big difference. My only reservation was that it was bulky and heavy on the ear if you have small ears like me. It kept falling off and so I was adjusting it so much that it became dangerous to have on since I was fumbling with it more than i would if I was holding the cell phone by itself. I recommend the Plantronics Discovery 610 if you don't like anythng wrapped around your ear. Overall good product though. Volume was a bit hard to adjust if it was on your ear though.,positive

I have a samsung stratosphere 2. If it fit a little better and did not go in and out sometimes then I would give it a higher rating. (Update) I stopped using this headset because it would just disconnect from phone and I would have to restart it for it to connect again. This started happening after people told me the going in and out was getting worse. I have downgraded my review to 2 starts because of this. Ended up going with a wired (gasp) skullcandy headphones with microphones and I can head people better and they can hear me with no problems.",negative

"A solidly built, multifunctional device with an ingenious interface... Too bad the whine of electronic interference from your car will most likely destroy the sound quality. A ground loop adapter can eliminate this noise on your end (what you hear from the stereo), but only at the cost of eliminating the bass from your music. As for the person you are trying to have a phone conversation with; they're just completely out of luck. This would easily get 5 stars were it not for this problem, but due to this issue, I can only give it 3. I've since replaced it with an Acoustic Research ARWH1 unit, which does a better job in terms of both call and music quality despite not even being designed as a car kit, and doesn't suffer from ground loop issues even when plugged into the car's power outlet.",neutral

Ever since i've owned the bluetooth wireless device I have had many calls dropped due to weak signals and static. I also have a big problem with the comfort of the device on your ear lobe. Wearing the product for more than 3 hour intervals will leave your ear's sore because of the insertable earpiece. Overall, the product is not something to rave about or invest money in. I would advise potential customers to look at other types of Bluetooth devices instead of Plantronic's bluetooth devices.",negative

"I've had this phone a few days now and I'm loving almost every aspect of it. I switched to this one after growing tired of some of the crappy ""features"" of my RAZR. This is kind of simple, but I love the fact that if I have a ringtone set for someone, it'd doesn't play every time that person sends me a text. Overall the phone is great, and all the other reviews talking about how great it is are right on, especially when compared to a RAZR. The things I don't like are: - You can't move the text on the screen, so it sometimes covers parts of your wallpaper. - It has mobile IM, but when you try to log in, you can't insert every kind of symbol. If you have an underscore in your email address you're SOL, no IM for you. - You can't change the soft keys to different functions so you always have Menu on the left and Camera on the right. - Call volume is a little weak in my opinion, but it works alright. - As with all Cingular's phones, there're ""Shop ______"" links at the top of every menu related to pictures, ringtones, videos, etc. It'd be nice if I could just get to my pics without being innundated with menu items that try to get me to buy things from Cingular. - For me, the top row of keys are a little hard to type when texting, but I got used to it, so it's not really that bad I guess. - Downloaded apps go to the Games folder, even when they're not games... I think that's it. The phone is great other than those things, but it's better than any other phone I've had. Beautiful design, great screen, good features, good reception... It's a great phone!",positive
"According to Jabra tech support the issue isn't bugs in the Nokia 3650, it's simply that Nokia decided to use the handsfree Bluetooth profile on that phone instead of the headset Bluetooth profile. All of these headsets made since the 19th week of 2003 support both profiles and are supposed to have the blue sticker about supporting the Nokia 3650. My only real gripe is that Jabra made this major change to the firmware but left the model number, etc., the same, so there's no way to tell what you're getting unless you can examine the box in person.",neutral

"I recieved this phone for 50 bucks with a 2 year contract and wow this is just terrible. I'll start with the few pros, there is a good deal of features but nothing that lg or samsung phones don't have. Now the cons, the camera is fuzzy overall bad, there is a very low amount of memory. usb driver costs a whopping 50 dollars from cingular, so transferring the pics is a big wallet drainer. The battery meter is terrible, it indicates 4 bars out of 4 then goes 1 hour later to one bar. It completely defeats the purpose of having a meter. U can't record ur voice and use it as a ringtone. Coverage is terrible on Cingular's gsm network, number of dropped calls is amazing with this phone. (I live in CT) Now for the worst part of this phone that should make u not buy this, whenever there is a ring, data exchange of any kind, the phone creates extreme disturbance with nearby electronic devices. Particularly speakers, if you like music, forfeit this phone, the crackling increases the amp volume and eventually kills your speakers. My brand new harmon kardon speakers for example, were victims of this, now the right tweeter continues to make a constant crackling sound, Not only is this phone terrible as phone, it manages to ruin the speakers of my house. I had to unplug my intercom system because of this thing. The crackling sound is a very annoying high pitch problem. Even if your volume is set low, it manages to increase the amp volume.

I used it to charge an battery for an old cellphone where the charger port was broken, battery died and I needed to retrieve info. from the cellphone. The clips on the charger held the cellphone battery in place. There are two prongs that attaches to the cellphone (or other devices) battery terminal and this is how the electrical charge is applied, once the charger is plugged into an outlet. The two prongs are not secure; weak and moves easily as if its loose. These prongs seems like they'll break easily if not managed w/ care. The prongs can also be adjusted from the front two outer plastic covered tips, which kinda works enough. It plugs into the wall and has USB port.

The hardest part was figuring out which direction to mount the outside antenna and running the cable outside. It took me about 2 hours to set up. The system is a little expensive but home phone service generally costs $30-$40 a month so this thing will pay itself off in about 7-8 months. 5 Stars!",positive

"I concur with other reviewers! This is a single room (maybe some directly adjacent rooms, DEFINITELY SINGLE FLOOR UNIT!) If you are close to the unit on the same floor it will work beautifully.

I think companies should be forced to stop this false advertising nonsense. 2500sqft in an open field maybe, NOT IN HOUSES EVER, unless your house is completely made out of glass! Just writing nonsensical disclaimers into the manual doesn't cut it: ""Walls and floors may reduce signal strength!"" How about ""Walls and floors will certainly reduce signal strength! Greater coverage only reliable in homes with very open rooms! Best used in small one bedroom apartments!""",negative
"Eureka! It works. For several years we have cursed at Verizon Wireless for the terrible service we have in our home. Anywhere else in our city - 4 or 5 bars, inside our house, less than 1 bar, dropped calls, static, etc. If it hadn't been that most of our friends and family are on Verizon, and that other service providers have worse service nationwide, we would have dropped long ago. I read the review on this cell phone booster, and as usual, some folks said it was terrible, but most said it worked. Bought it, installed it as directed - except we used a shorter cable to cut down on signal loss from the 50 footer provided, and guess what? At least 2 bars in most of our house, can even send and receive in our basement, which was impossible before. Set up is easy, I put the antenna in our attic, and the unit in the garage. My only regret is that we didn't get this unit a couple of years ago!!!",positive
"The NewTrent Mobile Power Pack is a lifesaver. I cannot tell you the number of times that my cell phone or tablet's battery was dangerously low with no place to plug in for a charge. I have dropped money into airport charging stations only to find that they either did not work or were very slow. As soon as this charger arrived, I tested it and found that with the Lithium-ion battery, it is powerful enough to work well with all of my devices (iPhone, iPad and Samsung 3S.) It charges quickly and easily with the micro-USB cable that is provided, and I use my iPhone/Pad data cable for the Apple products. A pouch is provided and its small size fits easily into a backpack or computer case. It is great to have confidence in knowing that important data or calls will not be delayed due to a dead battery.",positive

"I have had my RIZR from T-Mobile for a few weeks now after switching from Verizon. I was originally considering the Nokia 5300. But when I compared the 2 phones side by side, the RIZR seemed more solid, more durable and less flimsy than the Nokia 5300. So I chose the RIZR and I could not be happier. The phone is easy to program and a breeze to use. The display is bright, clear and very easy to read (even without my bifocals!). So far the sound quality and reception have been outstanding. The best feature for me is the mp3 player. With my new RIZR I can transfer mp3 songs directly from my computer to my phone with a simple drag and drop (the 128 MB card is not very large, but enough for my needs). I can then select the songs to act as ringtones. Being able to assign a song/ringtone to a certain phone number is a really cool feature, at least for me. The mp3 player included with the phone is very easy to use too. My only ""minor"" gripe is the screen goes black during calls. But I found pressing the volume up button, which displays the volume screen temporarily, brings the main screen back fast enough for me. All in all a great phone and highly recommended.",positive
"With my Palm Pre being the gateway to my audio content, I was growing tired of using a cable to hook it up to my Bluetooth-less vehicle. This was the cheapest solution for my needs (new car or new stereo are both too pricey today), as I wasn't expecting to take many calls...especially after hearing the reviews regarding the mic. Installation was pretty easy. I already had a ground loop isolator and it worked well with the LiquidAUX. One aspect of the installation was getting the remote to work. It seems that my unit needed to have the spring tension increased, so I lifted the spring (it was relatively flat) up a bit. Its been working ever since (a week now). Connection with my Palm Pre (Sprint) was easy, as the generic PIN wasn't needed to be entered. I had to use a splitter to power both my car charger for my Palm Pre (I use a Touchstone, and the USB port doesnt provide enough power for the Touchstone) and it works just as well. Both profiles showed up on my device and on the LiquidAUX. The LiquidAUX displays orange when connected and blue when in use, and there is an icon for music and for voice which helps indicate which profile is being used. The best part of the LiquidAUX thus far has been its consistent connection. It quickly connects to my Palm Pre in about 8 seconds after starting the vehicle (I have it attached to a port that turns off with the vehicle). The remote is great, as it pauses most audio programs running on my Pre (Pandora, what gives?!). The directions say that you can initiate voice commands with the 'Phone' button, but my Palm Pre has yet to implement this feature so I couldn't test it out. Lastly, the incoming voice quality is good enough for me. I mounted the LiquidAUX on the lower portion of the center stack, just above the cup holders and gear shift selector. It points towards me. I mention this to give you an indication of the mic's orientation. My voice is also a projecting one, so it helps my situation. I believe that coupled with the lower mount (decreased road and ambient noise) and my voice, people hear me fine. Again, this solution isn't aimed at voice calls in my opinion, and I would pay an extra $20 for a wireless mic that I can clip on my visor for a more robust voice call experience. All in all, a nice solution (even if temporary) for a somewhat wireless solution for audio streaming.",positive

I got this product for a friend of mine who is a Dr. Who buff and always wished she had a time machine. So I got her one. Very fun and requires little to no setup.

"This headset works great if I don't move. Unfortunately being able to move about is half the reason of buying a BT Headset.

"I had a negative shipping experience with this seller. Although they were ultimately apologetic, they were not proactive with a way to resolve their shipping issue. It really took over 3 weeks to get these small mail items. Also, when i called the company, the attitude was not unfriendly, but more like apathy. I am very concerned that there is no sense of urgency even once my complaint was made. The seller did want to have me promptly remove my comments about the poor service. Almost more than they wanted to fulfill my order in a timely manner. So, buyer beware. When the items came, please know that they worked...even if they appeared cheap. The headphones are very good.

I tried with another computer, but it seems the USB port (or modem) of the phone no longer works. I'm not looking forward to taking it to the service and waiting another month. On top of it, the warranty continues from the original date of purchase, not from the time of the replacement phone. 3. My friend used her's with a Jaba bluetooth headset and the circuit board got fried. The phone had to be replaced. I've used mine with the same headset with no problem. In short, although I like the phone and it's features I am a fed up with the problems and would not encourage anyone to buy one. PS.

"I drive a full-size diesel van with quite a bit of cabin noise, so any headset I've tried before this one never worked out; the background noise was always so bad that whoever I was talking to was driven crazy. That is NOT the case with this headset. It's so clear, people don't even notice I'm using a headset. Connection to my Blackberry is quick and works every time. It might not be as sexy or compact as the Jawbone or other models, but it's very comfortable and you can wear it all day without an issue and without worrying about it falling out. It fits very securely. I WOULD have preferred a charging connection that was a bit more universal, like the one my Blackberry uses. So - don't lose the cord. A case would have been nice too, but that's not a big deal. I still almost gave it 5 stars simply because it performs extremely well at what it was designed to do. All in all - well built, comfortable, excellent sound, and dirt-cheap. I paid $36 for mine, and after using it for a while, there isn't a single shortcoming that could justify spending twice as much on a Jawbone. Nothing against the Jawbone; this is simply a very good headset at an excellent price.",positive

"I'm not very happy with Virgin Mobile about this one. I've been using their service for years and have had at least a half-dozen of their phones. Overall I was happy with their service, but when I bought this phone almost two years ago my opinion of them started going down. Other than the battery issues that others have mentioned here, it worked OK for the first few months. Then I started getting text messages that were days old, or not getting them at all. I contacted VM support through the web site and they responded within 24 hours, but they wanted me to document when messages were sent and when I received them. I didn't have time to deal with it at the time and just decided to do without texting for a while. When I wanted to try fixing it again, they promptly said that this is a known problem with the phone and that they would send me another one. I got it within a couple of days, got it set up and it worked fine (other than the weak battery still.) However, after a few months I started having the texting problem again. When I contacted them they responded promptly again, and this time offered to send me a different phone. Without thinking I said OK, but then I did a little research on the phone they were going to send me (the TNT) and found that it didn't have bluetooth, one of the features that I bought the Flare for. I emailed them again and said, wait, I want a phone with the same features as the one they're replacing. They pretty much said that i have the choices of keeping the Flare without texting if I want bluetooth, take the TNT and have texting but no bluetooth, or buy a new phone. It also occurred to me that when I bought the Flare it was a $40 phone, the TNT was $20 most of the time that they sold it, if not from day 1. I think it's pretty cheezey of them to give me an older, cheaper phone with less features than the one that they're replacing. If they were more customer-service oriented, they would have offered me a better phone when I pointed out the lack of features in the replacement phone, even if it was a little more expensive when new.

"I generally like this headset. It looks light and cool and has good sound, and since the earpiece is in your ear, this works well in noisy environments. It does pick up ambient noise, but I can't imagine how that can be avoided in a headset of this type. I had a Plantronics 320, and this one is better. I wouldn't buy the Plantronics again. It stays put with the proper adapter, and I am really active outdoors. HOWEVER - I don't like the redial feature. I can't hang this thing up without the darn thing redialing, which has to be an annoyance to your last called number. Not only that, it will redial if you hit the button accidentally. This WILL happen if it's in your pocket. This is a potential disaster. This gives your last caller their own eavesdropping device. Why they designed it this way is beyond me. I can't find a manual online either, which is inexcusable for Samsung. It's too bad that it has these flaws; otherwise I'd give it a 5. Update 2009: I finally lost this one to the wash machine, and for the last year or so, had the WEP200. The sound quality is better, but it hurts my ear.

"My wife and I both purchased the BT350 on suggestion from a Verizon rep with our new phones. She got a Treo650 and I got the LG8100. Pairing the device was relatively easy, once you followed the written instructions. However, we've both had problems with the headset staying paired with our phones on a couple of occassions, and have to run the pair-up process again. When they work, the sound is pretty good. But most of the time, they don't work very well at all. And for the record, typicall my headset is with 3-4 feet of my phone - and I've had the same problems when it's less than 2 feet away with perfect line of sight. My wife and I almost never can call each other using our headsets and connect on the first try. Oh, it will call and we'll try to answer, and it will sound loud and usually clear - but one of us can't hear the other 99% of the time - at all. It's a series of ""hello-hello? HELLO?"" Forcing us to hangup and call again. Then we usually are connected. When we do connect, the sound typically has some static, minor digital echoing, and/or frequent dropouts such that you can't hear what the other party is saying. It's very annoying - almost like when you try to fake that your getting bad reception on your cell phone an...it...sou...ds..li..is. The one button feature is ok once you figure out what the various presses on it do. I've never had to adjust the volume buttons, but they are basically up and down. More annoying is the continuously strobing blue LED on the main button. When the headset is powered on, the button flashes. When you are actually using the headset (connected to a call) the button flashes faster. This confuses people when you are wearing it - because it appears to them that you must be using it since it's flashing. But it's always flashing! So if you are a person who uses it a lot and doesn't take it off very often, that can cause a problem. Even MORE of a problem is driving with it at night. For a week, I drove home in the dark with my headset, and found myself constantly turning my head to look for emergency vehicles as I kept seeing this blue strobe out of the corner of my eye. But of course when I turned my head, it was gone. I finally figured out it was the reflection of my headsets indicator light reflecting off the windows! That can't be good. On the plus side - it is very lightweight and easy to wear on either ear. It comes with an AC and a USB charger - which was great since I could charge it at work or with my laptop. It seems to hold a charge very well for long periods. I know I've gone an entire week without recharging. The range seem pretty good - though I usually never get beyond a few feet from my phone. Even though I can't take this headset back, I'm purchasing another one because this one is pretty much useless if the intent of it's design is to have a simple to operate, hands-free and safe method of communicating with your cell phone. The BT350 simply doesn't meet any of those standards.",negative

"After reading several good reviews on the H610 I decided to purchase as I am living in Italy and roads are difficult at best to navigate. I knew it came with US maps loaded but wrongly assumed it would be an easy thing to get the Euro maps. After I checked their website, they said ""maybe"" they would have the maps ready by spring 2007. This was baffling to me that a GPS would be released with all these ""world traveler"" features like currency/temp conversion, etc. and not have world maps available. Besides that, the user manual can only be accessed through the CD, which can be frustrating when you are looking for how to do something. The tiny booklet that came with explained almost nothing. I still am not sure what the M button on the side was for, other than the fact that it kept getting stuck down and would make the MIO boot in some sort of maintenance mode. Finally, I was not impressed with the look. The screen is just too small and cannot be changed to horizontal (or at least not easily because I could not figure it out). Also, the color and wrist strap that come with the thing have a decidedly feminine look to them and then I found some websites where the thing is advertised as ""GPS for Ladies"". You can imagine how much fun my coworkers had with me when they saw that. All this added up to me returning the product for a refund. Regarding the GPS features, it seemed to hold a signal well and play all the multimedia junk fine, but the negatives far outweighed the positives.",neutral
"Overall I really enjoy this headset, its small and fits in my ear nicely. It is really easy to use and hear the person on the other end of the phone call. The only issue I have is that I live in a large apartment building and get some static sometime due to the large volume of wireless networks and other radio interference. When I am in my car or not in a area with low wireless usage it does not have this problem.",positive

"Mine must be the debunk one built on a Friday night at the shelf. My battery life on a Lithium battery roughly 10 hrs! Not as advertised or even on other comments. I have been going through batteries like underwear! Naturally I am getting to hate ordering from Amazon as getting ahold of one of their vendors is a real PITA! The Trackstick.com website was quick to reply but I did not buy the item from them. I believe my ""Super"" Trackstick is not so super as I don't see the Powersave feature as advertised and juice keeps dying with at most 2 days activity for me! Covert magnet is good and signal capture is good, even under the engine (under metal blocking open sky which they don't suggest). That does make some signals goofy but you can easily spot the outliers. Geospacial software and Google Earth are easy to use if you have a brain and can operate Windows. Again my only problem is lack of communication from my vendor Telespial Systems (no a voice mail at 8am and no reply to my emails constitute as quality conversation), and battery life sucks. It is advertised to last weeks at a time but really only records 10-30hrs of data. Time wasted if constantly scanning for a signal. I've seen other comments of similar posts with little juice life.",negative

"I purchased this phone from my local T-Mobile store along with an Unlimited Nights/Weekends/1000 Whenever Minutes plan and I must say, I am very impressed. The phone is beautiful and thin, and although this phone has been available for a long time now, I still can't get over how thin it is. Reception is great, and compared side by side to my old Samsung x475(T-Mobile, same network as the RAZR), the RAZR always wins on the reception. Where my Samsung gets 1 bar to no service in my room where I am typing this from, the RAZR gets a steady 3 bars, sometimes 2 but it never goes below that. On my old samsung, calls sounded weak and the audio would clip a lot, sometimes the call would even get dropped. I have yet to see my new RAZR drop calls. The screen on this phone is beautiful, or at least the main screen. The front screen on the outside of the phone is color but it seriously lacks contrast and color saturation. However, for an external screen, it does just fine. This phone also has bluetooth and has worked flawlessly with my bluetooth headset. I have also been able to send pictures taken with the RAZR's camera to my friend's camera-less phone via bluetooth. If you are looking for an affordable, stylish, bluetooth-rocking cell phone, this is the one.",positive

"This phone looks good on paper, in person, and in my pocket, but it was a huge hassle to use compared to a Treo. First, everything runs sluggishly and it takes a long time to do anything. The Treo has less memory but runs much faster because it is better optimized, and more importantly, has a touch screen. With the touch screen, I can click on links, buttons, etc., even with my finger, which saves a lot of time compared to using the thumbwheel and arrowpad. Finally, the Q's battery life was terrible. I thought I received a defective unit so I had it exchanged...the second unit was just as awful. Finally, the Q's keyboard looks better and is bigger, but is harder to use -- the keys are harder to press and because the system is slow, sometimes keypresses don't register (while Windows Mobile is trying to catch up or something). I wanted to like the Q but came away utterly disappointed.",negative
"I purchased these headphones for use with my iPod and Motorola phone. The pairing isn't very good with the iPod, takes fiddling with, constant turning on and off to get it to pair.

"I had been very happy with my Motorola phone until the battery started losing its charge within a day, even when the phone was turned off. The friendly but incompetent customer support kept me on the phone for an average of 40 minutes for the repeated calls trying to figure out the problem. After the phone had finally been sent to their technical service center, they returned it to me that the phone was irreperable ""due to customer abuse."" I have done nothing to that phone that could have caused any damage (unless using it to make phone calls counts as ""customer abuse""), but got the same comment, without explanation after I had sent the phone in for a second time for reevaluation. It seems that Motorola is just trying to get out of fixing or replacing the phone free of charge under warranty. You'll be fine with a Motorola phone as long as it works.

I got this for my non technically inclined brother so he could get good home cell signal. I walked him through the install over the phone and he cold not get it working. Next time I visited I spent 4 hours trying to get this to work. He lives in a marginal coverage area but it seemed to always be interfering with itself. I took it home where I have ok coverage and it did boost the signal marginally. I did get it to work well once I found the direction of the nearest tower and aligned it just right. The issue then was that the supplied cable was so short the booster and repeater were interfering with each other. So I went to radio shack and got a 50' cable and put the receiver in the attic and the repeater in the basement. I got good reception as long as I was within 10' of the repeater. Useless for my brothers needs. Overall I was not impressed.

"Ok, so I have had several nice Bluetooth headsets in the past, I'm a heavy user and needed a spare so I picked up this one because I couldn't pass up on the cost savings, and the other reviews for this product were decent. After 2 weeks all I can say is, if you are looking for a good bluetooth, pass this up and shell out the $40 or more dollars to get a better one. Cons: - Several times my connection has dropped mid-call...for no reason (about 5 times over 2000 minutes of use). - Should you ever drop that call...there is no way for you to reconnect without hanging up on the call, and dialing that person/conference back. - You can NOT have the volume turned all the way up (which is sometimes necessary to hear properly, i.e. conference calls) the other person will get their own feedback. Pros: - Price - It does work and call quality is clear. - Its still better than using wired headphones, when it works.",negative
"for fairness sake, this screen protector is not bad for the price, i didn't have a problem putting it on but can see how someone with thick fingers or a bit clumsy would have trouble with it.

If you use the FM modulator you have to be pretty close to the stereo and that picks up some feedback. Also, the mic picks up alot of breathing noises so I put some foam from some cheap headphones over it secured with a rubber band. You think at the price it would have something over the mic to stop excessive noise. All-in-all though its a fun product and with some tweeking you can have alot of fun.",positive

Let me start with this is the 4th one of these I have had over the past 4 years. Life span seems to be about a year. I know they leak where they mount to the existing shower pipe and this can be solved by adding two rubber washers to make up the distance to the threads. This solved the leak. What surprised me was this was completely dis-assembled. The head was not attached to the arm and the arm was not attached to the mount. The pieces were loose in the box. This is an upgrade to the old style so I used the old one as a guide and assembled the new one. It works but there is no way to tighten the tension down where it can't be moved and the parts are not interchangeable. I did notice that if it gets where it will not stay in position there is no way to re-tighten. If this happens I will open it up and RTV it permanently in place where I like it. The only reason I replaced the old one is the rubber tips were splitting and no longer spraying a single straight stream. 3 stars because it is to much trouble to assemble.,neutral

"Around Christmas 2004 I bought the Motorolla V276 phone from verizon. Horrible idea. Really horrible idea. I bought it because of the ideal price, but I really got what I paid for. The battery of the phone dies 3-4 times quicker than every other phone I have ever owned, there is a constant static in the background no matter if in the basement of my apartment or driving to work in the suburbs. It has gotten to the point where I can only talk on the phone when it is plugged into the charger and I am holding the phone at a certain angle. Usually when this happens I take it to the verizion store and they replace it with a new phone. So the customer service on this phone is great, and thats the only thing that saves it from a 1-star rating, but I shouldnt have to go to Verizion every 3 months to get a new phone. Maybe next time this happens I will just buy a Nokia. One last reason I dislike this phone (although not a technical problem): When going through your recent calls, it lists your last 60 phone calls.

These fixes make it a four star phone I think). -Phone buttons get pushed easily in the provided holster (even with lock screen enabled - the green and red phone buttons are still active and they stick out and so you will answer calls without meaning to, or hangup occasionally). -Processor is a slow 201mhz by todays standards. While this makes for good battery life, it is disappointing to see Cingular with the 400mhz Hermes/8525 and Sprint with the 6700 and set to release the upgrade to the Hermes - the 6800 in October. (Verizon has the XV6800 now as well). All are faster machines with faster connections. And, of course, there is the iPhone with a 600+mhz processor. -T-Mobile help just told me that the darn phone will not always sync recurring appointments correctly. This is of course not a T-Mo or an HTC problem but a WM6 problem. Apparently if you put a time limit on the recurring appointments it solves the problem. Say - this recurring appointment will end after 999 ocurrences. ============= Bottom line (so far for me): if you have a Dash or MDA (ATT 8125) or something comparable that is still working - save your money and wait for the next ppc. Certainly the various 6800s are better than this. If you want a qwerty ppc with touch screen - you might be pleased. It may be the best T-Mobile could do given their limited technology (no 3G in my city yet) and customer preferences (small phones are more popular).",neutral

"I have tried many bluetooth headset, cheaper to expensive models. All of them are not suitable for me, until I bought this Jawbone Noise Shield Bluetooth Headset. It is very comfortable to me, the sound quality is good, the noise shield feature works perfect.

"I really don't have a lot of time. That is why I shop online, So if I'm purchasing an item that is to be used to make life more convenient, like a Bluetooth headset, it really is obnoxious to receive one that is ""worse than sucks"". This item did not even charge. Plantronics really needs to pull this item because it is really damaging to their reputation to have this out there for sale. I choose Plantronics because as a Regional Sales Manager/Road Warrior, I've always had luck with Plantronics. Too bad that this one was a lemon.",negative

"I had this case for 7 months now. It was great for the first few months, until I noticed slight discoloration along the leather edges (it turns blue/green) from rubbing. The leather stitching is also frayed on ALL sides. I however wore this case inside my front pocket. If you wear it like it's intended (hanging outside your pocket), it should maintain its new appearance for a long time. Because I like to wear my Blackberry Curve phone inside my pocket instead of letting it hang out like a fanny-belt, I decided to get an OEM BB slim case that usually comes with a new Curve phone. My 3/5 star rating is simply due to this leather case's inability to maintain it's like-new appearance IF you rub it often. If you're a plumber, construction worker, it'll probably wear out quickly.",neutral
"Purchased this headset because of all the positive reviews and paired it with my Motorola E815. So much for that. The call quality was horrible.

I'm going back to using my Plantronics wired headset until someone makes a wireless headset that actually does what it's supposed to do. Work!",negative

"I hate this phone. 1. Pitiful battery life. OMG, it's the worst I've seen. 2. The d@mn Push To Talk button on the outside of the case is always activating. I don't use PTT. So, when I have the phone in my jeans pocket it constantly beeps as I stand up and sit down. 3. The volume control on the outside of the case is in an awkward location. It's on the flip cover so if you're on a call and want to adjust the volume you have to contort your hand and slip the phone downwards in your palm to adjust it. All the while trying not to drop the darn thing.",negative
"No matter where I put it, I can't seem to get the signal to boost. There's absolutely no difference in signal quality when it's installed and running and when it's off. :(",negative
"Update two years later: The unit's red light always stays on now, and it doesn't amplify the signal any more. I don't know if that's because I upgraded to a Motorola Droid 2, or what. But I always get 2 to 3 bars at my desk now, so I don't really need it any more anyway. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Overall, I'm pleased with the zBoost YX300 zPersonal Cell Phone Signal Booster unit, which I purchased to help with signal strength in my home office. It makes a definite difference. Not huge, but big enough to meet my needs, and well worth the price. I work out of my home office, and use my cell phone (currently a Palm Centro on Verizon) at my desk regularly. Standing out on my sidewalk, I get three bars. In most of my house, I get 2 bars. For whatever reason, sitting at my desk I would occasionally get two bars, but usually only one and sometimes none. After adding the zBoost, I always get two bars at my desk, which is a critical difference. I had hoped that I would get 4 bars at my desk, but that didn't materialize. But I'll settle for always having at least two bars, because now my calls don't drop and my voice quality is good. I found the setup pretty straightforward, with the exception of the suction cups on the antenna end not sticking very well, even to a slick surface. I solved that problem with an adhesive cable tie base, attaching the antenna to it with a couple of plastic cable ties. Fortunately, the suction cups on the base unit stick to the glass just great. It is crucial to observe the distances specified in the instructions, which are pretty scanty, on the back of the box. My base unit is stuck to the window at approximately the same height as the antenna (about five feet up), and the two are ten feet apart, give or take a couple of inches, and have a clear line of sight between them. I sit midway between the two, i.e., five feet from each. Both base and antenna are vertically oriented, if that makes any difference. The idiot light on the base is always green. It is also crucial to connect the antenna cable to the base first, and only then plug in the power. The light will be red, and stay that way for ten or fifteen minutes while the unit acquires signal towers, etc. Once it turns green, you can accurately guage the results. So, just three stars, because I had hoped for more bars, but the ones I got have made a critical difference to me. I would recommend this device to anyone with similar needs - just keep your expectations modest.",neutral
I purchased this and charged it and used it one time. After the first use it will not charge again completely. No matter how long I leave it plugged in it only shows it as having 25% charge. I haven't returned it yet. Hope there isn't an issue.,negative
"I'm not thrilled with this. It had some of the best ratings when I researched it online and here on Amazon, but the quality of sound/ reception of this device is not good. Some days I sound fine on it & other days people can't hear me & the calls drop or break up. Often people tell me it's obvious that I'm on a blue tooth speaker & I sound far away or tinny. The car I'm using it in is a 2011 which doesn't have blue tooth - and I'm using it with an iphone5.",negative
"We've had our Supertooth Light(STL) for about 2 weeks now and paid about $[...]. Before that, for 2 weeks, we bought the VRBT200V(VR3) from Costco for about $[...]. My wife is not a techie, so when I buy a techie thing for her it must be simple. For the $[...] extra dollars, the STL had 4 advantages over the VR3: 1) Clarity: on the freeway the STL better background cancellation; 2) Battery time: VR3= 6 hours; STL= 15 hours; 3) Chargers: VR3= Car lighter (I have to leave my keys in my car and my car on to charge this way for about 4 hours); STL= AC and car lighter (AC took about 3 hours to fully charge); 4) Simplicity (answer/call): VR3 has 2 small buttons and you have to remember which button is to answer and which is to hangup/cancel; STL 2 buttons -- green and red (can you guess which is for answering?) In addition the green and red glowed their colors at night for easy identification. Pairing (connecting to cell phone): Both units seemed to pair about the same from what we noticed. VR3 has the display for caller tel # and you're able to view calls received, missed, and made (hold the round control down for about 3 seconds). My goal is simplicity. It was worth the extra $[...] to make my wife ""feel like a techie"".",positive

It is made of plastic and snapped the first time I sat down in a chair. At least I was able to hear the phone drop and did not lose. I highly recommend the hard case, and would encourage the manufactoring company to either take the holster off completely or do a redesign to correct the weakenss in the clip assembly.

"I bought this headset to use with my iPhone. If you have an iPhone, read the last part of this review. Overall its an okay headset. Hooked up to my computer and I can now listen to the computer wirelessly. It is a little confusing getting it into pair mode. There are two ""M"" (Motorola Logos) buttons, one on the left and one on the right. It can be confusing remembering which one you should hit. It does not do much to reduce background noise. I am happy enough with it for the devices that it works with. If you have an iPhone, this is not the product for you. Really, this is designed to listen to music through. If you want to just take calls a smaller ear piece is better. The iPhone(as of 1.1) WILL NOT play music through this well. There is a hack that will allow you to play music through it. If you go to voice mail and turn on the headphones, and return to the iPhone, then it will play MONO music through the iPhone. However, the iPhone will still play through its built in speaker. If you plug ear buds in, then it cuts off the wireless headsets. I do not fault the headset for the iPhone issues. The iPhone is just NOT currently setup(as of 1.1) to play music through headsets. I hope this changes in the future.",neutral

"PROS: - Small body - No protruding antenna - Nice big screen - Plays MP3's and allows you to make playlists - Voice Commands - Looks cool - Good signal so far, drops fewer calls than my last phone - Memory card expansion slot CONS: - Of the 100 MP3's I tried to sync, only half got transferred... and the rest generated generic errors. There doesn't appear to be any rhyme or reason for the failures. - The ""OK"" button is small and even after I've gotten the hang of the ""touch"" buttons, I frequently need to push ""OK"" 3 or 4 times before I get it to register. - Screen is unprotected. There isn't a rim around the screen edges or any other type of protection for keeping the face of the phone from getting scratched. To do my best in keeping the screen protected, I've attached the phone to a lanyard and have been wearing it around my neck since the day I got it... and yet there are still a couple of small scratches already. I hope there will be a way to easily replace the face, because I'm sure even the most careful person will have scratches all over the place in less than a year. I bought the essentials kit, and have enjoyed listening to music through the headphones.

The rate of charge for the HTC phone is only about 10-20% per hour 4. The curly cable is short and stiff - very inconvenient to use. Despite the officially-looking Samsung label, the charger looks very cheaply made. Actually the label is the best made part of it. Conclusion - stay away, buy something else.",negative
"I live in a major metropolitan area, surrounded by cell towers. But my home is at the bottom of the hill, and I've always had problems with cell phone reception. It's very common to see me or one of my neighbors outside talking on the phone, trying to find better reception. No more. The installation instructions on this device are pretty demanding. So I wanted to test it out before I installed it, to make sure that it worked. Installation does require a penetration through your house for the coax cable. This wasn't quite clear in the instructions or the description. Cell phone coverage at home is now a necessity for me, because I'm running my business out of my house. In fact, my office is in the basement, where the reception is the worst. So it was either find better reception or rent an office. in my test installation, I just kind of toss the antenna onto the roof. So it was facing more up than towards any cell tower. When the correct cable through an open doorway, plugged everything in, and viola: 3 bars instead of 0 or 1. Fantastic call clarity. I've now made a more permanent installation, with the receiver antenna aimed per the instructions. Now I have 4 bars! I would say this is a fantastic device for improving cell phone reception in urban areas.",positive

I charged it up and used it less than a dozen times. It worked fine the first few times, charging my iPad and iPhone. However, after a while, the battery could no longer be recharged and is, therefore, useless.",negative
"This cable worked great out of the box, but like a few other reviews mentioned, deteriorated very quickly. It was only $3 when I purchased it, so not a huge loss and not worth the effort to try and return, but you definitely get what you pay for. Full disclosure, I had very low expectations on it due to the price so I can't say I'm all that surprised at the poor performance. The picture is still fine with them, it is the sound that went out. Like another reviewer mentioned it almost seems like the cables are not shielded and there is a ton of interference on the audio. Moving the cable so it's not in direct contact with other cables is not really an option with my setup, but I imagine it might help. Purchase with caution.",negative
"Palm should have retained more of the features of its plain PDA OS, rather than trying to copy stupid interface features from Microsoft. Overall, NOT a great job, really. The reviews are quite unhelpful about the PDA applications. And battery standby life is about half of the 300 hrs specified in the description. I used to like the Palm OS, but... The OS now used by Palm in the Centro (and 680)is a screwed up version of what they have in their PDA's. For example, in Contacts, there is no longer a compact, single line, listing form. Instead, you must view all phone numbers for each entry on separate lines in the main listing. No choice. This means you can't see very many listings per page. Also, if you are not careful about entries, and put a word description with a phone number, you may just get a blank line. It used to be that word descriptors were just fine, as well as helpful. Blackberry has the more flexible and compact entry format that Palm used to have. Also the amount of information you can now enter for each number is more limited. Two steps backwards for Palm. Also, if you press a letter, such as ""J"" to see all the last name listings that start with ""J"", in alphabetical order, you are out of luck. It finds every bloody listing entry with a ""J"", whether it is first name or last, that you have to scroll through. This means fewer helpful listings per page. It means you can no longer enter a letter to skip that far down into the alphabetical listing, and if you enter something as specific as ""john"" to get to Johnson, you will go instead to first names listed as ""john"", assuming there are any in your contacts before Johnson. Also don't try to be cute and enter several letters such as ""jaa"" to go to the start of the ""j"" listings. The PDA will complain and not even let you scroll further down. The plain PDA OS does it sensibly and returns an alphabetical listing of last names starting with ""J"" if you entered a ""J"". And you could scroll from there all the way to Z if you so desired. One bug in the Treo 680 that has been fixed in the Centro relates to the display of contact information. Suppose you click on a contact entry for which you entered a fair amount of information. That is, more than can be displayed on one screen (Given the inefficient way information is now displayed, that is not hard). On the 680 you will not find any cursor or arrows to let you move up or down the page to see additional information. But there actually is one that is invisible in the bottom right of the screen. On the Centro, it is visible. But did Palm fix this bug in the 680? No. Owners of that model are stuck. This is expected given the general contempt Palm shows toward its customers. You will also find stupid changes in the Calendar. For example, you could on a Palm PDA hit an entry for 9am on a particular day and it would let you start an appointment with 9 am as the default entry for start time. That is, while you were viewing other appointments you could select an open time for a new appointment. Now it doesn't enter that default (on the next screen). In my view, Palm has messed things up enough you might as well use some other OS. Like what Blackberry offers, although overall their PDA/PIM seems less efficient. Oh, and customer support says this new PDA platform is exactly what Palm intended for the PDA smartphone, even though they know it is different from their PDA's. So which do they think is better? If they think so highly of the implementation on the Smartphone, why don't they change their PDA's? Palm won't say, but I think we can guess. Palm's right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing, and anyone with good judgement has long since left the Palm development group.",neutral

"I use this for my job as a field technician out in the Texas heat. I sweat a lot. My old bluetooth headset is plantronics ATT V521. That design kept it off of my head and dry from my perspiration. The V510 on the otherhand will have a large surface area directly on the side of your head and it collects a lot of sweat and moisture. My unit failed after about 2 weeks and this might be the reason why, or maybe it was defective. I sent it back and got a refund. I went back to using my old V521. If you work in hot areas or you expect to sweat all day, the V510 design is not a good choice. On the other hand, The V510 stays on your ear firmer and is more comfortable than the V521. And the sound reception was extraordinarily good with the V510, much better than the V521 until it started to die.

I had the samsung e315 previously and this was never an issue. I never had any phone numbers stored in the phone book, only in the sim card. 3. Once you switch the numbers to the phone book to save into groups, all the phone numbers will not store in the group; only the first number that is stored under the contact. The good things: 1. The phone is very cute and very lightweight. 2. The sound is great. 3. The picture/screen resolution is crystal clear and very bright. 4. Once you figure out how to use it, the phone is great. 5.

My only complaint was the install was a bit more complex than I was lead to believe but thankfully I had an attic and was able to run the coax cable down where my cable TV coax went.

"Since I have found customer reviews helpful in the past on Amazon, I felt it my duty to warn you about this product. I was originally sold this product at an independent Verizon wireless store. Since they didn't have it in stock, they were going to send one for free. When that didn't happen, I decided to buy another one here. I was excited that the online price was less than half of what I was going to pay in the store. Obviously, I learned, yet again, you get what you pay for. The cover is meant to be used in two ways. 1) You can put the plug in the back and just put it in your pocket, or 2) you can put a different plug in the back and use it as a belf clip. This was a great concept in theory, but in real life, did not work at all. The belt option never worked correctly. Every time I sat, stood, walked, stopped, or just merely breathed, the phone would pop out of the backing and fall to the ground, which completely defeats the purpose of a cover. After two weeks of trying to fight with it (even considered gluing my new phone to the cover), I put the other plug in and now just put it in my pocket, which smears and scratches the screen since there is no protection for the touchscreen. I would not recommend this cover.",negative
"So the product works great once its connected properly. Installation itself is easy, just strip and crimp. The things is that the the only differentiation between the wires is the white writting on one. I could be way off base here, but in my expereince the writting typically designates the (+) possitive wire. So when I hooked this up the first time I wired it as such, insterted my phone power adapter and promptly blew it out ($20) down the drain. Lesson learned: always use a multitmeter to figure out which cable is which. In this case the wire with the writting on it is (-). I have since installed several of these for friends to have a hardwired cellphone power cable that is hidden behind the dash and doesn't occupy the factory cigarette lighter. Great price - Great Product - Lack of proper Labeling",neutral
The product is okay but could be better. The first problem I had was one of the latches came off immediately upon receipt of the item while trying to open it for the first time. One is easy to open but the other sticks so it requires some extra force to open. The latches are apparently designed to be removable so I was able to just slide it back in place but since it is so hard to unlatch I have pulled it totally off on three occasions now. I could just glue it in place but the fact that it is removable makes me wonder if the manufacturer is planning on it breaking eventually. Why else would it be designed so it can be easily removed? The second problem I had came after flying with it. There is no pressure release valve on it and after getting to my hotel I attempted to open this case and could not. I had to use a pocket knife to pry it open which is fine when I am on the ground but not so fine when I am on a plane where I am not allowed to have a knife. Upon returning home after another flight I was able to get the case open without my knife but it was not very easy. Since I bought it to keep some battery backups in for long flights it I don't think it will work for my needs. Edited to Add: So far I have not had any issues opening the box while on a plane. I still have problems after I land as sometimes it need to be pried open but at least while in the air it opens fine. I am still using it but be aware that if you fly with it you may need a tool to pry it open after landing.,neutral
"This phone is awesome. I have only had it for about a month, but I have enjoyed it from day one. I can truly say that it was worth every penny. My screen did flicker on me one day, put all technology isn't perfect. I recommend that you definitely go out and buy this phone.",positive
"I live in an area where phone reception is horrible. Although there are pros and cons with this phone, the majority are pros: Pros: 1. Out of all the cell phones my family and I have used, this one takes the shortest time to connect as well 2. Clarity with every conversation 3. Numerous amount of features. 4. aesthetics 5. battery life is long Cons: 1. like most phones and services, accessories and fees for extra services (i.e. for verizon the V-cast feature is aprox $15) 2. The camera is good for about a 1.0MP but the zoom blurs once you reach the max 4x. 3. It is rumored that after a few years, the screen blinks. This is TBD and I personally have not heard of any other technical error(s). In general if you take good care of the phone, the phone should work.",positive
"Here's the deal, no bluetooth headset, and for that fact no headset is perfect. Now...with that in mind, let me give a little bit of background. I have had more headsets, cell phones, and other hands free devices in the past few years than most people will have in a lifetime. I have poor hearing due to numerous surgeries on my ears and have found that while I can headsets are great for me when I'm in a completely quiet environment. Having said all of that, I bought the BT800 about 3 weeks ago after reading numerous reviews from a plethora of sources and coming to the conclusion that the vast majority of the comparisons and reviews I read rated this headset as #1. As stated I have had the headset for about 3 weeks. Getting to the functionality...it pairs with my phone and laptop with absolutely no problems/issues. My first few calls left me feeling as if the ear piece could fall off of my ear at any point in time, however after wearing it longer and longer and making hours of calls I have found that the headset is surprisingly sturdy. The inbound audio is remarkable, and when compared to nearly if not every other headset I've ever had, it's the best. The microphone is nearly ""too good"" and it took me numerous phone calls to finally figure out that the microphone is so sensitive that you have to position the headset so that the microphone is pointing sideways or even a little upward (not down towards your mouth). Getting to the point I spend about 2 - 6 hours a day on my cell phone and would guesstimate that I spend about 3 - 5 of that while using my headset. The headset is comfortable, the audio is great, the microphone is loud, and the DSP works quite well. Bluetooth pairing is a breeze and it took me about 2 minutes (after charging) to set the headset up. The only negatives I have had so far have been with regards to ""voice signal."" I use voice dialing often and have found that when using any means other than the headset my voice dialing software is about 85 - 90 % accurate. When using the headset my initial results were about 20 - 30% accuracy. As I have had the headset for a while I have found a few ways to improve this and would guess that my accuracy via the headset when making voice dialing is now probably around 75 - 85%. It's not perfect, but considering everything else it's really the least of my problems. Overall I would highly recommend this product. I am enclosing a few links to various reviews that I have come across on the web. A few of these have very detailed information that you may find useful with this purchasing decision. 1. [...] [...] Good luck and happy talking.",positive

"I had this phone for 1 month before returning it back to the Cingular Store. Although the phone is innovative and a sure beauty, there are some unfortunate flaws that compelled me to return it. Pros: - Great reception here in the city. It could pick up a signal and hold it better than my roommates' phones (Motorolas, another Samsung). - Beautiful phone: color and design is very attractive, and I loved the slide function b/c it was so different from the candy bar and clamshell shaped phones - AMAZING screen. It's large, sharp, colorful, and bright. - Quadband GSM phone, so you could take it just about anywhere and use it, which was a definite appeal to me b/c I travel a lot - Modern phone w/ a lot of the latest new features (ex: quadband, edge, bluetooth) found in newly released phones, so I guess it's pretty high end for a standard phone that's NOT a smartphone. - Decent battery. I didn't have to charge it every day (maybe every other day), even though I talked on it for about 1-2 hrs on it everyday. Cons: - VERY LOW VOLUME!!! This is the worst thing about the phone. Outside, it's very hard to hear someone talking or to hear an incoming call (ie: walking down the street in the middle of the day). I've definitely missed calls b/c the volume was too soft, and it was VERY difficult to hear the other end of the conversation when I did receive a call in public. - Not many accessories came with the phone, so you'll have to buy your own case, USB cord, memory card, etc, and they're all pretty expensive. Considering how expensive the phone is w/o having to renew yourself into another 2 yr contract w/ Cingular, I expected at least a small memory card or even a case! - I felt like the menu was a bit unintuitive. Many of the cooler applications (alarm clock, calculator, timer, mp3 player, etc) seemed to be buried deep w/in the menu, and you really had to dig through the menu to find them. - There aren't that many applications/etc that come built into the software of the phone for more personalization. For example, there was a very limited number of ring tones that were part of the software, and they weren't even that good. The 2 games on it are trial versions. I paid $299 for the phone, and I felt like I paid too much for what I was getting. It's a great phone, but I wouldve liked it more if the volume was a louder, and it had come with more accessories (considering the price tag). Maybe I'm hard of hearing, but I'm pretty young so I know I'm not deaf. If you have hearing impairments, then this phone might not be for you, and if you don't mind a softer volume, then go ahead and try the phone out. One last note: it gets smudged a lot. Maybe it's b/c the phone is black that the smudges are more noticeable, but after a few uses you'll notice how much your fingerprints leave a mark! Overall, great phone with some flaws.",neutral
"Ahead of the competition T. Na from Ann Arbor, Michigan I have purchased two IMP500 from NewTrent since May 2009. I first bought the IMP500 for my iPhone last May. The product worked exactly as it was advertised. I was so happy with it that I bought another one as a Christmas gift for my son-in-law's blackberry because he travels very frequently to the Far East which usually means 14 to 18 hours of flight. He cannot be happier with this extended battery because he could watch movies for the entire trip with plenty of battery life left upon arrival to his hotel. The company is definitely well ahead of its competitions. During this year's Comsumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, I stopped by a few booths of similar products. I was surprised that all their products were for one extra charge of the iPhone.",positive
"Way back in February I was looking for a phone battery for my Motorola Razr V3m and I read great reviews on this battery so I purchased it thinking, why not. why don't I try this for my phone. When I got it in the mall I took my old battery out and put the new one in. I turned off my phone and charged up the battery. It last for a day in a half but then after that the charge would only last 4 hours. A battery should at least last a day to 2 whole days at least I think they should. But this battery wouldn't stay charged that long and I was really disappointed. Don't purchase this battery if you want a good one that will hold a charge.",negative
Doesn't provide enough power to many items I tried using it with.,negative
"Let me start by saying this is a great headset. Comfortable, lightweight, and easy to hear and operate. The layout of the controls is spot-on; they're easy to use and locate. The button on the end of the mic boom is awesome for answering and ending calls. If your phone has voice-dialing, holding down that button will launch your phone's voice dialing feature. The volume rocker was easy to use; however, pushing it in to mute the mic produced the same tone as swiveling the rocker to change the volume, so you never really knew if you had muted your call or just adjusted the volume. They really should have had different tones associated with those functions, especially since it's two distinct functions in one control. Range and battery life were all outstanding. Charging is quick, and the status light is handy. Pairing was a snap; worked first time. It's comfortable enough to wear for long periods, and it's very unobtrusive. Not so much that you'd forget it's there, but enough to leave on and not bug you. This headset has only two downfalls. One: no noise reduction circuitry. The microphone on the headset works very well; unfortunately, too well if there's *any* sort of noise in the area -- another conversation, a TV twenty feet away, a barking dog in the next room -- were all as clearly heard by my caller as my own voice, prompting her to ask me to move to another room where it wasn't quite so loud. And trying to use it in the car, forget it. I was told that I was barely distinguishible from the noise of the car. Two: The manual. This is one of those manuals where they give you one small illustration and 327 different languages (actually, it's only 7, but it feels like 327) on each page, so the pairing instructions took up about 5 pages, but about half a napkin's worth of content. That's a thoroughly annoying feature; so annoying to me that I skipped the manual altogether and went straight to the website to get the instructions all in one language. That's significant enough to me to be a downfall. All in all, this is a great entry-level Bluetooth headset, priced right for the ""value-conscious"" consumer. But for anyone who expects superior quality conversations, rivaling those offered by your ""actual phone,"" I would pay more for a better quality headset with some noise-cancelling circuitry. I suggest looking at the Jabra FreeSpeak BT250. It's got the same general wrap-around-the-ear design, but it's a little more than the Plantronics (about twice the price at the time of this writing). However, it's still under $100, and with built-in noise reduction, it's well worth it, IMHO.",neutral
"Before you buy this case (or any case), you have to ask yourself what you're really looking to get. If you're looking for slim fitting protection for your iPhone that won't stick to the lining of your pocket and leaves the screen fully accessible, this is an excellent case. If you are looking for something that is bulletprooft, shock resistant, and belt-clip compatible, you're looking at the wrong item (I recommend the ToughSkin line from Speck for that crowd.) What do you get for your money? This is an ""eco-friendly"" (Whatever that means) plastic shell for your phone. It's designed to prevent scratches to the back of the device and the ceramic antenna cover also on the back. It provides a raised edge around all the buttons and the screen to protect them from scratches and damage resulting from minor drops. The case also has what appear to be clips for an optional belt clip, but Agent 18 isn't offering one at this time. The key feature to this case is the way it assembles. The top portion fits very snugly onto the upper half of the phone, but the bottom half fits more loosely and clips into the upper half. What this allows is super easy removal of the bottom half for docking. I've been doing this for weeks now and have yet to accidentally remove the lower portion. It's a perfect balance. I recommend this case for anyone like me, looking for a thin, simple, easy to use protector that won't bug you for being in your pocket.",positive

"I like it ok. I have to put it on a couple of times before it fits right. The on/off function is not as efficient as one would like. I have to be careful not to let off when shutting it down or it will dial your last call. For the price, it works just fine.",neutral
"I couldn't be happier with this case! Its lightweight and relatively easy to remove, yet provides full protection for the screen with a raised edge. I feel much more confident about an accidental drop now than I did before. The clip is hard plastic, and seems to work well, but I do wonder if over time it will stretch a bit. The phone will not fit into the stand-up charger with the case on, but that can be solved by either flipping off the bottom of the case or else plugging directly into the phone. There is an odd raised edge on the case around the headphone jack, and when I wanted to use a Belkin audio car plug, I had to do a touch of cosmetic work with an exacto knife to overcome this. The raised edge is not a problem when using the ordinary earphone plug. With this case on, that feeling of trepidation I had about taking my phone everywhere has vanished.",positive

"I was impressed with the reviews on the Motorola HS850 and looked for favorable references to the volume available on the unit. My hearing is not as good as it was 20 years ago and knowing that I would be using my Bluetooth as I drive meant I would have to have a unit that I could hear easily. That was not my experience with the Motorola HS850. I used it just two times and gave up on ever being able to hear adequately. It probably works as well as any over-the-ear unit, but it was not sufficient for me. I replaced it with a Bluetooth that uses an earbud earpiece and I get along fine with that unit. If hearing is a concern for the buyer, I would not recommend the Motorola HS850. In every other way the unit performed as advertised. It was simple to pair to my phone and it picked up calls and transmitted my voice just as I expected it to. If I could have heard the unit, it would have been fine.",neutral

After charging it all night, I used it for a few short calls the next day and it still had a full charge at the end of the day. I was very excited! At the end of day two, I had used it for a few more short calls and the battery meter still showed 3 out of 4 dots. I only paid $5 for the battery so even if it lasted just one day without having to recharge, I would be happy. But it lasts much longer than that and I couldn't be happier!",positive
"Yes, this phone has some excellent features - that would be why I selected it about 10 months ago. Unfortunately my contract/warranty leaves me stuck with this lemon. I am yet again using a disposable phone while I wait for them to replace my LG AGAIN.

It is usually either in the recharging station, sitting on my desk or in the cell phone pocket of my bag. It just stops working out of the clear blue. Every LG VU CU920 I get loses the touch screen capability within weeks or months. I can answer calls because that is a mechanical function, but otherwise it becomes a paper weight.

"I give a 3 because this product is confusing. Spend the extra 2 bucks and get the carry case, and all the extra charging adapters, so you can use your phone or your computer to charge your headset. As far as it falling off. It never has. I was worried at first, so I gave it a test. My glasses flew off before the headset even felt like it was going to go anywhere, however, I had a horrible headache after I shook my head that much. So take my word, if you get it in correctly it is not going to fall off. This headset can be a bit bad in noisy situations. I use mine to listen to music off of my laptop between calls from my cell phone! Get the noise canceling headset 645 if you're going to use it in a noisy place. But the 645 won't work with 2 devices at once, like the 640, the 645 requires you to re-connect. It is a trade off, so choose wisely.

"I wouldn't rave about this particular bluetooth set. It works. It does the job, but I'm not over the top on this one. This would be a great bluetooth set for someone who jogs or bicycles.

Fit is exactly like iPod earbuds. Comfortable and not pain inducing. Audio is good, I would have to say excellent. A person I was speaking to could hear me clearly while I was sitting at a drive thru window waiting on food. In fact, the mic is so good, she could also hear the people inside the window talking. The only major problem I'm having with this is that there is no easy way to wear it if you're going with the clip and not the chain. I have not found a way to get it comfortably situated to where the wires aren't dangling all over the place and getting in my way. I haven't tried wearing it on the chain because that seems like it would be too far away from my mouth (mic is in the controller) and the chain is just going to be one more thing in the way. Settled on this one because there is no other bluetooth that will fit my ear & stay in place, and no wired headset I can find to fit my phone.",neutral

"First off, I can't seem to find the perfect Bluetooth headset. I've been on a search for the perfect one, and so far I'm on headset #7. But anyway, I bought this one because I have multiple phones, a razor and a blackberry from work. Because of this, I thought the multipoint tech was a nice feature to have. Let me tell you, it is. All you have to do is push the top button and the talk button and you seemlessly move from one device to the other. The sound quality is also good with this headset, both inbound and outbound. I have a loud car (350z convertible) so wind noise is still something that it doesn't hold up to, but this one performs well compared to most. However, the most disappointing thing is that even when the battery is full, the headset disconnects from the phone all the time. I can talk sometimes for hours and no problem. Other times, I talk for about 5 minutes and it drops. If it wasn't for this problem, I would give it 5 stars, but this is very annoying. One last thing, and this applies for all headsets...it sure would be nice to standardize all plugs, and I think motorola and blackberries are pretty much all mini-usb plugs.

"I bought this with the intention of using it with my vast supply of rechargeable AA's, however to my surprise I discovered that it would only work with non-rechargeable batteries. In fact it wouldn't even work with brand new Duracell Alkaline AA's. Apparently it will only work with Energizers, though I'm not sure how that's technically possible. As often as I would expect to use this to recharge my Evo Shift when I'm out an about, I would be buying and throwing away an awful lot of non rechargeable batteries, which isn't very cost effective and isn't great for the environment. It works pretty well with the supplied Energizers that come with it, and it does have both Micro and Mini USB connectors, but because of the limitations it only rates 3 stars from me.",neutral

"I purchased this headset with high expectations. I took my time. I compared and contrasted. I read all the reviews. I thought I had made a great purchase. Unfortunately, the ergonomic design of this headset does not match the electronic design. I can't believe how badly Aliph missed the mark with this headset! First, the good. The sound from this headset rocks! The noise mitigating technology is great. I work in computer data centers the noise level often fluctuates. The set adjusts both the sound heard by the other listener and the volume that I hear. It still has very poor quality in windy environments, but I don't know of a set that doesn't. Now the bad. This headset wouldn't be allowed in Guantanamo Bay. It is pure torture to wear. The various combinations of ear bud and ear loop just gives you more ways to inflict pain on your ears. I can't wear the headset for more than about 10-15 minutes, and sometimes end calls due to the uncomfortable feeling. I used to put the set in my pocket between calls. Problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily. I contacted the company and they indicates that this is because if the loop doesn't break, the headset itself would break instead. The company told me I could ""gently"" bend the loops to fit my ear better. They also recommended Jabra ear gels instead of the Aliph ear buds. They also recommended a place that can make a custom gel earbud (for about $65 + shipping). I asked them if it felt right to them that I paid $130 (Best Buy) for their headset and then have to bend the pieces that come with it and buy a competitor's ear gel just to make it comfortable. They didn't seem to have a problem with it. I finally got around the earloop pain by bending a paper clip around my ear and using that for a loop. I do intend to buy a different ear gel bud because Aliph's just hurts my ear. Also interesting that when I told them I had relieved the loop problem with a custom bent paper clip, they never asked to see it. They don't seem interested in improving the feel of this product on the ear. All said, I would never buy this product again and cannot recommend it for use. The is sound quality not worth the pain.",negative

"I bought the BlueAnt ST3 after reading many good reviews. I would give it a 4 rather than a 5. It is decent quality but not something exceptional. It's positives are that it holds charge for long, it's ability to go to sleep and wakeup on the car door closure are great. However, it's sound quality is not as good and it does have challenges iin pairing and transferring the address book. I later bought a Jabra Cruiser-2 for my other car and found that to be far superior in voice quality, but it did not have the feature of wake up on door closure. Overall, I still found that to be better than blueant-ST3. Apr 11: Adding to the original review. After some use the voice quality of the Blueant ST3 has degraded. The ring tones is jarring and the voice is low. It is not as easy to understand on the other end too.",neutral

"the Sanyo PM-8200 is a powerful business tool. You can surf the web for map quest directions, collect your email, view your IP cameras and basically just about anything else you would do with your laptop. The camera on this phone is excellent, it has three resolution settings and even a digital zoom feature. I am an electrical contractor in Atlanta, Georgia. All of our electricains in the field have these phones, should one of them have a question they simply take a photo and either email it to me at our office or send it to my phone. We also use the camera feature for estimating. The ""Ready Link""(Radio)feature, much like that of Nextel's ""Direct Connect"", is outstanding, however, unlike Nextel, you will be hard pressed to find yourself without signal. Sprint's coverage in Atlanta is excellent. I rarely drop a call. The Sanyo PM-8200 is by far the best cell phone/tool our company has ever provided for its employees and Sprint is a very customer service minded company. I would reccomend this phone and Sprint to anyone considering changing cell providers and/or upgrading equipment.",positive

"I am using this to keep my Garmin Nuvi 360 powered up while driving. I didn't know this when I got it, but if the Garmin is plugged in and not using battery power, it automatically turns on when the car is turned on (that's what I get for not reading the instruction manual, lol). To have a cleaner appearance in the car, I have the mini-usb plugged into the ball mount that is holding the GPS and not plugged into the GPS itself. Unfortunately, that port is really close to the ball mount which restricts it's movement when plugged in. With the adapter, it makes the cable less intrusive and makes the GPS free to adjust with the ball mount to nearly any position desired. In combination with a 1.50 mini-usb cable, probably the cheapest way to keep my Nuvi charged while driving!!",positive

"This is my second bluetooth headset. I felt it was time to upgrade from my BT130 Jabra. I have a Motorola Rzr so I thought it would be great to pair it with a Motorola headset. I decided on the H700. I liked the design, the folding boom microphone, the fact I could use one charger for both phone and headset. The headset worked great for about a week with a couple of times losing connection...I did not think twice about it. No static, great, clear, quality sound. However, after one week of use my phone would detect, would pair, but was UNABLE TO CONNECT to the headset. I took it back to the store to exchange it for a different unit. The new unit paired and connected ok but there was noticable static when in use. I did not experience the static with my first unit. This inconstistency to the quality of this headset is a disappointment to me. I expected more from Motorola especially since they charge so much for their headsets. I am returning this headset and I will give Scala 500 a try. I will let you guys know what I think about it. So in summary the H700: 1) looks good 2) small, light, portable 3) the folding microphone boom is very convenient in turning set on/off 4) when it worked it worked GREAT 5) dissapointed with the inconstistency in quality. My suggestion: Do give it a try. If your set works you will REALLY LIKE IT. make sure you purchase from a place that will take it back though just in case you run into problems like I did with my 2 sets.",neutral
"These headphones have been discontinued by Logitech. I purchased a pair in January 2006 and the headband broke within a couple of weeks.

I purchased this wallet to replace one I had purchased from a company that no longer is in business. Positives: This product clip is great it swivels for both vertical and horizontal placement. The cell phone part is good with a magnetic clip. It has a clear card area for the DL. Negatives outweigh the positves though: The credit card holders are so tight that on the first day of use they ripped just trying to get them in. There is no place for cash unless you leave it loose and don't even think about change for it. The wallet part is bulky and the clip is not flush with the wallet so sliding onto your pants takes some effort because it gets caught on the swivel part. Lastly the magnet unlocks my phone when put into the case.,neutral

Although I do sometimes get static, overall the quality is wonderful, and so far the battery life is great. I have used this wireless headset for numerous long phone calls and have yet to have it die on me. You will not be disappointed with this purchase. By the way, one other selling feature compared to the Motorola's: I seem to be able to keep the volume down pretty low on the Jabra, but have the option to turn it up much higher in louder environments. With the Motorola's, I always had the volume near the highest setting, even in low or normal sound environments. I was afraid I would not be able to hear anything in louder environments.",positive

"This is a great design! Looks awesome! Great concepts! How does it work? Eh... decent. There are problems with this HS being used with a V3c. Its been said before. STATIC. No idea why but it comes and goes as it pleases. For the most part I have had good luck on my side. Static hasn't been a big issue but yes its there. Depending on where you place your V3c. In my pocket sometimes I get bad static. I also get the ECHO. But if the V3c is in line of sight with the H700 static is not a problem. I have tested this thing out many times and at times people tell me I sound ""muffled"" while other times people say its fine. So in all the H700 has its downsides. Its not consistent at all. But it does work good when it works! I'm going to hold on to this one but I may try another brand out to see how it holds up. Jabra BT800 is another one that isn't so good and the Moto H3 just doesn't work at all with the V3c. I love the concept of being able to open the boom to turn the headset on (rather than the infamous hold the button for 5-7 second rule).

It kind of flops on your face but it worked well. No problems being heard or hearing. However, the 3rd week I had it, I dropped it on the living room carpet and it fell apart where it had been open before. All the pieces inside came tumbling out. I thought I had everything put back together and it turned on but wouldn't work after that and it wouldn't stay together - had to tape it to see if it would work. No go - Bummer!

So he got his new phone which consisted of the very much dreaded volume bug He ended up getting the 4650. My experience was as follows, I had the phone for about 6 months, and it got washed. I'll admit it was users fault, but I've washed countless phones even a chocolate and it survived, this phone died, I took it apart, and tried to see what was the matter, after still 4 weeks of sitting nothing happened and it was dead.

"What all can you expect for five dollars? My friend and I like to drive around and play Pokemon go, but she gets disconnected a lot. I work in remote areas, so I was looking for a way to get cell signals farther out anyway. I know some radio dudes, and they all told me there was no way this thing could actually do anything I tried this thing out, and it seemed to help... maybe... in one spot in town, but we decided it wasn't really doing anything. I mean, it wasn't hurting, so I left it on for a while, but there was no way it was actually doing anything, right? Turns out it was hurting, because the spot I put it in meant that when I tried to wash my windows, there would be a big squeegee drip going down the middle of the windshield... Time for this thing to go. I ripped it off, and pulled up the tape on both sides. Turns out there is some sort of circuit board with a lot of coiled wire on the inside one. That's... well... if you were going to make one of these so they did something, you'd need that... I picked up my friend, and we drove around to play our game. half the spots we'd found since I got this antenna suddenly didn't work for her at all, and were a lot harder for me to connect with too. I guess it was working. On the package, they note that if there is no cell service at all, this antenna will not be able to do anything, and even in areas where there is coverage, it supposedly will only add half a bar. I guess it was adding half a bar in some places around town. A lot of users got this for their homes, since it says that it can be used there too. The package I got said ""For Vehicle use only."" I'm not sure if ones for home use only exist or not. Antennas like this, if they can do anything, need to have their inner part and their outer part placed a specific distance apart. Auto glass tends to be a thin single pane of 1/16-1/4 inch thick. Home windows tend to be double-pane, with 1/2 to 2 inches between the panes.

"Hi, I had total of 2 of these headsets and I actually liked the headset at first because of the way it fit my ear, which was very tight and sturdy. The very first one that I bought I had troubles to get it connected to my phone right away, which what I thought at first could be a compatibility issue with my phone, even though my previous headset (Motorola H375 - see my review about it) NEVER had this types of connectivity issues (but it did have some durability issues of it's own). So after playing around with it I ended up doing a hard reset on my phone, after which I was able to finally get it connected. I've been using this headset for about 3 months, during which I had some connection issues every now and then, but I was always able to get it resolved each time after playing around with the settings and the phone, which in some cases took quite a while. Anyways, the last month the connections issues started happening more and more often and one day my phone wouldn't see the headset at all. I tried my old cell phone and my wife's cell phone to recognize the headset, but neither one would ""see"" it, even though the headset itself seemed to power up and making appropriate sounds as if it was in a pairing mode. Ok, I thought maybe it was my bad luck with getting a defective piece, so, since I REALLY liked the durability and fit of this particular headset, I went online and ordered another brand new headset just like this. The story with this one was that it would power up but none of my phones would be able to recognize it from the very beginning after I received it, so I am sending this 2nd one back for a refund and looking for another substitute in the meantime. Even though I really liked the way it fit my ear, I will not waste another dollar or a minute of my time trying to get one of these to work. For all these reasons I do not recommend anyone to buy it. Try something else and hopefully you will have a better luck with it. Cheers!",negative

I purchased this approximately a month and a half ago and it has been perfect. Everyone I talk to on it says I sound good and I can perfectly hear them.

"I actually liked this headset. I had one previous to this (forgot which model) and I think this one was overall better. I could hear the person on the other line very well, no problem there. The only part that underperformed was the microphone. The other person could hear me fine when in quite areas. The microphone would pick up everything to a certain degree. A feature that I loved, but many may not need, is the ability to listen to music. The only downside to this is that sometimes the songs would skip if you held the phone to far away from the headset, which is about the length of my arm (sorry don't know how long that is). Overall a decent headset and had a cool feature that I liked.",neutral
"I do like the overall quality of the handset but it has a big flaw, it seems to be a half-duplex device, it means that the sound can only travel in onde direction at the same time so when the person on the other side of the line is talking or making noises he/she won't be able to hear what I'm saying. The biggest problem comes when the other person is in a noisy environment, in that case the person on the other side of the line won't be able to understand anything I say.",neutral
"I was minutes away from ordering this phone on Amazon. It looks amazing. Trouble is, it does not have the proper 3G antennas for United States 3G (AT&T). So you will only get EDGE speeds unless you are out of the US (Europe, etc). Everything else on the phone will work just fine, but 3G will not. Just a heads up if you missed the mention of no USA 3G in the description. I just got the N95-4 instead so I could have 3G. The camera on the N82 is much better, but I can't stand EDGE data. Too slow. If you are on T-Mobile in the states, or don't care about 3G, the N82 is the phone to get!",neutral
The Samsung WEP 200 - Headset ( ear-bud ) - wireless - Bluetooth is very clear and is very small. I like it. The down fall is that you must have a direct line of sight with your cell or else you start to get static immediately. distance with direct line of sight is good. One more down fall is that it does not have noise reduction so it picks up all of the noise around you really good. I had the Motorola H700 and that was good on the noise reduction. If you like getting attention for your gadgets this one gets plenty becasue of its size. something I can live without.,neutral
"I purchased this headset to go with my Motorola Razr V3. The good: Small size especially when microphone is folded. Very good sound quality transmitting, good sound quality receiving. Fast connection when opening the microphone. The bad: Not adujstable for ear size/shape. Somewhat loose when in position. Details: I checked out the sound quality with several calls including calls to voicemail where I compared messages placed with the headset to those using the handset. The quality was very clear and crisp in the transmit direction with none of the echoing or hollowness others have reported. The receive direction was only marred by occasional low-level pops and clicks, but use otherwise very clear. I also noticed the looseness when the headset was in position, but I found that by changing the position you can make it feel more secure: in my case by not pushing it on too far. The problem is that this headset is not adjustable for ear size and in my case the speaker outlets end up pretty far away from the ear canal such that when I use it in the car the volume is too low to be acceptable, even using the provided rebber skirt. Bottom line: if it fits your ear properly you will probably be pleased. I just don't know how many folks it will fit properly!",neutral

However, after watching the brief video clip at Sena's web site, it turns out to be very easy to get out - a simple ""pinch"" of the leather at the bottom of the case. I like the case because it is slim, adding almost no bulk, yet also protective - I've dropped my iPhone at least twice and because of the case no scratches. Highly recommended if you want some protection with minimum bulk.",positive

"Just got my WEP200 yesterday. Took me about 10 sec to connect to my Razr phone. Reception is perfect (no static, sound is clear and loud). The first charge took longer than the specified time which is 2 hours for a full recharge (took 4 hours before I got the blue light). As for how the headset holds in my ear, well I guess I got the right one (ear) because it hold solidly in place and is relatively comfy. BUT I tried both ears: in my right one, with the loop positioned as shown in the instruction manual, the headset had no grab at all; with the loop in the same position, I tried the left year and the fit was perfect. A trick here: when you set the headset in your hear, insert it as solidly as possible in your ear while holding the WEP200 vertically; once inserted turn it 90 degrees while pushing it in your ear. In my case that locks it solidly.",positive

This is my first Samsung phone after a string of European-made mobiles. Feature-wise it was no different from my old SE Z500 which I got more than two years ago. I had to give up menu efficiency once I got this phone. The worst part of the menu is the lack of differentiation what's inside ""Settings"" and ""My Stuff"". I would imagine that the changing alarm settings can be accessed in the screen as changing dates and times, but this phone makes you backtrack, press, press, backtrack, press, etc. to get there.

"My Sony-Ericson HBH-DS970 has worked fine with my Treo 650 for more than a year now. The problem is it keeps failing. I keep exchanging it under warranty but it's a hassle and I'd like to find something more reliable. I use my headset while riding my bicycle and need something like the DS970 with earbuds. Cans and bike helmets don't mix. Much of the time, I just leave the earbuds out but set up my Treo to auto-answer on the 2nd ring. All I have to do then to take a call is stick an earbud (either one) in an ear and say ""hello"" once it picks up. My only other complaint about the DS970 is that the battery life isn't long enough when I'm listening to music or a book on tape. When I'm on a long trip and won't be jostling the ever so fragile headphone jack on my Treo, I plug in a wired headset. When I can't do that and want to be able to listen on and off throughout the day, I've learned to power down the headset at times when I can just as easily answer the phone without the headset, i.e. when I'm not driving or riding my bike. I really like the way it pauses the music when a call comes in. The music quality is acceptable for what it is. Tomorrow I'll call and get my DS970 exchanged once again but I need something similar that's more reliable.",neutral
"It works, but I found out the hard way that the earbud doesn't like to stay in my ear. The first day I used it, three or four people couldn't hear me at all and hung up on me. The others said they could hear me just fine with the exception of my boyfriend, who's had trouble with the sound quality every time I've spoken to him on it. I may attach a wire twister to the earbud so it stays put more effectively. I could even run a wire or firm piece of plastic or vinyl between the earbud and the mouthpiece... It's better than brain cancer (or ovarian if I kept the cell phone in my pocket).",neutral
I have an Ipod 120g and I bought this hoping that it would fit. Well as it turns out it does fit. I am so impressed with this product because I drive a truck for a living. I use the holder and an fm transmitter to keep me going when the radio gets too boring. This product is put together solid. The suction cup adheres to the window then you actually tighten the hold by twisting the base. The other thing that I really liked about it was the fact that it doesn't shack my Ipod. I could actually watch a movie on it in the holder and not have a problem seeing it. Like I said I drive a 10 wheeler truck that shakes and rattles a lot. Over all I would recommend this product for anyone who might even think that it will hold their Ipod,positive

"This is a great concept, and everything is good about it compared to a wired headset, except two things. First, there is a very little bit of static or fizzing sound in the background of listening to music with it from my Smartphone. And second, much less important to most except those like me, it doesn't capture the ultra-low frequency bass sounds that I like to hear. It has very good low bass and overall range from highs to lows. Understand the difference between low range bass and ultra-low range bass. I don't know if the slight hissing sound was due to the Smartphone or the speakers of the headset, but otherwise it's excellent.",neutral
"I got this PDA for one week and became extremely disappointed. I had used Palm Treo 300. By far, it could not come close to Palm in term of easy to use, stable, intuitive. You have to navigate many times to get you want. This probably is not important for you. I intended to use the PDA to read ebooks and listening to MP3. Unfortunately, it fails in both areas miserably. First, there are not many quality programs for smartphone. I tried Orneta reader and ClearVue PDF reader. cleareVue pdf reader just could not open any pdf file (internal error). With Orneta Reader, it always displays a turning symbol blocking a big area on the center of screen and you cannot move it or scroll it. What a horrible program! Well, you can blame other vendors for failing to deliver good software. What about the phone? I have a 512 MB SD card. 95% of time, the phone just doesn't recognize the card. Device not ready / available! Try it many times, ocassionally, it decides to recognize the card, and you cannot put file on to it! How about battery? The first time I got it, I followed instruction to charge the battery, more than 20 hours. Yes, I charged it continuously more than 20 hours. And in next half day, all of charge was gone and I didn't spend time on the phone! Some people might get a good one. For me, this PDA is just a terrible experience.

"No one could understand what I was saying! This was a used headset, so perhaps something was wrong with just this unit. The reviews on the H700 were okay, but THIS particular one was useless. It also looked somewhat beat up when I received it. Right from the start people were saying that we had a bad connection. Most people said that they just couldn't understand me.

If you would like go ahead and return it to us however a restocking fee will be charged by BooksExpress610.""

It also depends on if you return the provided accessories with it (USB cable) restocking fee is between 5%-15%."" So, I shipped it back in the exact condition it was shipped to me in, with the USB cable, and, of course, they charged me the full 15%! I will avoid Books Express610 for anything in the future!

"Maybe I just received a dud, but I purchased this specific headset because I used previous models (H850 and H700) both before and was fairly pleased.

She gave it right back after the first hour because of ""hissing noises"" she claimed to hear in the background. Sure enough, I paired it to my phone, and even with no call and just walking around, I would hear some light hisses and crackles.

Wish I could say I was exchanging it to try another, but now my mom just wants to stick with the old-fashioned wired headset instead.

"Some of the third party sellers are not selling this headset in new condition. I received one in generic packaging from PC Micro Store that was missing the quick start guide and the warranty card. Disappointed to see the crappy packaging, still more disappointed to see it's missing parts and looks suspiciously used, but at least the charger, cable and ear loops were there. However, upon charging it and trying to pair, it would not enter pairing mode. Suspecting it may have been used before, I reset the device and it went directly into pairing mode. It had already been paired to three devices and the headset memory was full. If I wanted a used headset, I would have bought a used one, this was supposed to be new in retail packaging. Problem with the seller, not the product, but still Amazon's fault as it was ""Fulfilled by Amazon"" certified or whatever. I like the headset so far. It's well built, smaller than I expected, and the LED indicators are pretty cool. Sound quality is much better on my iPhone 3GS than two Jawbone Primes, which never worked right. Not super comfortable, but not bad. Edit 1/14/11: Amazon customer service is great. I emailed them to complain about this, and they apologized and gave me a credit for the entire purchase price. Lesson learned, be careful who you order this headset from, but if it's through an Amazon (""Fulfilled by"") partner they will take care of you. Edit 1/20/11: Flashed the Z9 from version 3.3 directly to the Z9i version 1.1, works great. Headset now automatically reconnects to the iPhone 3GS (without having to manually push the multifunction button). One bug with the 3GS and this headset is that voice dialing for some reason makes the Z9i shut off. Voice quality is good and I can wear it about an hour before it gets uncomfortable.",neutral

The positive: Sound quality is excellent. No highway noise detected-even the radio is not an interference. Easy link to phones. Charge time good enough. The negative: Going back to the manual for call management refresher-again. Disconnected an important call when answering. Want total ease of use on an L.A. Freeway.,neutral

"The best bluetooth headset I've ever owned, hands down! I've had em all, Motorola HS810, the 850 (before it was released in the US), Plantronics old model, Jabra BT 500, 810 (the one with the LCD). There was always something wrong with them, either voice too low, caller couldn't hear me, uncomfortable, etc...but I gotta say this is THE best headset I've ever owned. I am a Field tech, I am always on the road, in crowded places and I was shocked when I heard my callers say they can hear me crystal clear while I was driving, in a mall, in a bar for a company party...and I could hear them and I didn't even turn my volume all the way up...imagine that! After trying all these headsets going back 2-3 years I thought Bluetooth technology would never be as good as wired headsets boy was I wrong. I found my perfect headset. Pros Comfortable, stylish (imo). Quality during speaking and listening are top notch and frankly this is the most important anyway. Cons Really...after the quality of this piece anything supposed negatives I will tolerate...so will you!",positive
"I just got this ci er yesterday. I am very mobile with my job and use of phone. It was easy to put on my Samsung 4. Love how it protects the phone and still fits in back pocket. For work I keep it in my work bag. Buttons work great, no problems pressing them or controlling them like other covers. The only thing I am disappointed in is that the material it's made of Is very sensitive to fading and scratches. I have only had it less than 24 hours and it has a spot where color wore off. I don't even know how that possibly got there since I only started using git this morning, and it was only in my bag securely put away. I have seen my son's Otter Box color black quickly faded or essentially color rubbed off from any type of friction, soft or hard. I am big on esthetics, so I am going to have to return. The way it seems, it will most likely fade in color completely in less than a month! Too bad, I love the fit, and color purple with pink trim.",neutral

"Installation and setup of the wireless extender was as easy as purported. However, I'm having a hard time determining whether I'm actually getting any improvement in cell reception while in my home. Voice quality during calls is still only fair to poor with lots of garbling. And I still have instances where someone tries to call me and the call goes straight to voice mail without ever ringing my cellphone. I had hoped the extender would overcome some of the inadequacies of cellular technology, but that seems not to be the case. It's interesting how bimodal the reviews for this product are: folks either love it or hate it. Based on other reviews and my own experience, it would seem to be a good product in applications where there is a significant difference in the signal strength outside your home vs what you get inside. That is, if you get 4 bars outside and only 0 or 1 inside, then this may be worth a try. On the other hand, if you get a decent signal in your home and you're just trying to improve call quality (as was my case), then take a pass on these extenders.",neutral

"While I don't doubt that the battery inside this holds 5200 mAh, it seems that much of that capacity is lost in voltage conversion, or something. After a full charge, it could only bring my Droid Razr Maxx (3300 mAh) from 5% to 80% charge before depleting itself completely. While it was discharging, the upper half of the unit got very warm. I suspect that it's dumping a significant portion of its capacity as heat in converting the battery output voltage to 5V. Returning it to get something more capacious.",negative

"I got this BT headset to go with my Samsung Instinct. My older Plantronics Voyager 510 died just before I recieved the Instinct. I figured I would try a differnt model for the new phone. Sorry I did really. I will be returning the 855. Overall it is not that bad I guess. Here is why I am returning it. 1. The biggest problem is the sound. On my end everything is very ""tin can sounding"" and actually there is quite a bit of static as well. People I called said I sounded fine to them though. I had to use the extra ear piece(stereo setup) for people to sound good..sorta. 2. The silicone ear piece. I just really don't like the way it feels in my ear. But this is a personal thing. Others may find it work well for them. Just not me. 3. The volume control kept defaulting back to super quiet. Everytime I made a call, or used the voice calling features on my phone I have to reset the volume on the headset back to an acceptable level. Kind of a pain to have to do that. Actaully quite annoying to me. 4. The thing just doesn't feel like it is made to last. Feels cheaply built. The sliding boom mic won't last I know it. This is again personal opinion. Others may be fine with it. 5. you really have to add the over ear hook. At least for me it won't stay in my ear very long otherwise. Kinda silly to make the ear hook optional when you really have to use it. Ok the good. 1. When I added ear hook it works fine and is really pretty comfortable. 2. The weight of the whole setup is great. Compared to my older 510 I hardly knew it was there. 3. It paired with my Instinct super easy. So over all I am not happy with it. I give it 3 stars because some of what I feels is wrong with it are my issues with it. These may not be issues for others. Although the call quality probably will be for most people. I will be going back to Voyager 510. Those things are great. I had no real issues with it. That is until it died on me. Good safety tip here... Don't drop them in the water. Apparently they don't like that and they die. OOPS. I hope this helps someone looking at these reviews.",neutral

"I have tried three of these boosters, and this one is the best so far. One piece goes in a window facing the closest cell tower. If you have low E windows or metal screens, it may interfere. Then you run a cable from that piece to the second piece, which can be up to 25' away. In our case, it adds about two bars to our signal strength, which is a nice boost. Easy to install and does what it it supposed to do.",positive

"I don't want much. I don't care about cameras, bluetooth, internet access, etc...I just need a phone. Motorola's V197 seemed like a great answer...It suited my needs well initially...it seemed durable, had more than enough features, and worked well. But then I discovered that reception inside my house was nonexistent...I have to go outside in order to talk to someone. I've had little problem with this in any of the phones I've owned for the past ten years. So I'm a little miffed that I can't talk inside on a phone purchased in 2009. To make this worse, I found that the battery life is absolutely terrible. I took my phone for a two day trip and decided not to pack the charger. Two days and a new phone...what could go wrong? I hardly used it and the phone died just as my trip was ending, forcing the use of payphones. This is a so-so phone if you just want to talk and text. I was hoping for simple things, and the V197 couldn't even remotely deliver them!",negative
"The product does work. I have used it with two different phones. However, I did have to purchase the two adaptors for my specific phone.

"Qualifiers: I am a Mac OS user, live near a major highway, and work in a major urban (read: solid digital coverage). I am usually surrounded by computers, but am increasingly finding myself engaged in business travel, offsite meetings, and the like. For me, the Treo 650 rocks. Claims that it replaces a laptop are bunk. However, it can totally suffice when no other computer access is available. (Our company firewall went down and the only way I could connect to the internet was with my phone. THAT was a first.) Software can extend the Treo's capabilities, just as with any other computer, so having access to services like IMAP email accounts (the built-in VersaMail only does POP), Instant Messaging, and so forth really are what make the high price tag actually worth it (but yes, you do have to pay for the add-on software from third parties). I've had no problems with build quality, or with setup or service from Sprint. $15/mo. for unlimited wireless internet access? Worth it to me, based on my current internet usage patterns (so, of course, your mileage may vary). This is a digital-only phone, so service quality is directly tied to PCS digital coverage, so just be forewarned. The keyboard is great, but very small, so watch those carpal tunnels. ;-) The camera is low-rez, but it's great as a backup (only an idiot would try to use a 2004-era phone as their main digital camera - that's like serving water with a slotted spoon). Given that the Treo *is* a computer, it does crash. If you can't handle a brief reboot of your phone from time to time, don't even bother. It's not happened so often that it's been a major usability issue for me. The voice quality was skimped on, but there is apparently a firmware hack floating around to improve that (hopefully Palm will release an official patch). The Bluetooth syncing just works, for me, on both Mac OS and PC. On the Mac, downloading Apple's iSync conduit will allow full syncing with iCal and Address Book (sadly, minus categories and photos). Having gone from the basic, bare-bones 1999 phone to this, it's been - dare I say it - a life-changing experience. It's not perfect, nothing is...but is it useful given it's limitations? Without a doubt.",positive
"I've had the Jabra for about 6 months now and use it daily. It takes awhile to get the ear piece to conform to your head/ear. The connection to my Nokia 6310i will drop and reconnect frequently only when I don't have an active call. Range is not impressive (varies from 3' to 20') but it does make talking while driving much more manageable. I saw no need for the belt clip and it is mounted as a static charging station on my desk. And yes if you do have this device on you cannot put on your glasses as you normally would. I have had no problems putting sunglasses on and off as I drive without disturbing the Jabra or the active call. Due to changes in ambient noise levels, sometimes I cannot turn the volume down low enough and it will be quite loud in a quiet environment. It needs improvement in all areas. It should be smaller, more comfortable, have longer range, better clarity and a longer talk time. Maybe with the next version.",neutral

"I deliberated on this purchase a LONG WHILE prior to shucking out the frogbacks to cover the bling ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PLANTRONICS-VOYAGER-855-BLUETOOTH-STEREO-HEADSET/dp/B00140S7BO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PLANTRONICS VOYAGER 855 BLUETOOTH STEREO HEADSET</a>"", a great little deal here and all - yes - I understand it is obsolete equipment but functional math still competes in my hood - down to 31 from 1 and a quarter, that's some serious buck back brother... Still - there's always something about these fussy little wire connections that mean even fussier, even tinier little soldered connections - ""THE WEAKEST LINK"" somewhere in the chain. I was thrilled to see the type of cordage connection incorporated in this device; figured this might take me past the cursory 30 day limit I get from most wired acoustics toys. Imagine my frustration when I lost ear bud attached stereo in just over a WEEK! Folks, I'm wheelchair bound and not particularly rough with my goodies yo; NOW - figure out where my head went when AMAZON decided my ONLY RECOURSE was to get a full refund, 5 weeks after a return of the item and needing to hoop dance to purchase the ink to create the barcode for shipping, yada yada, blah blah... SAVING GRACE? The PLANTRONICS TECH C/S PEEPS themselves (late on a Sunday evening no less)! Apparently the lonely dude operating the latte machine that night was in a congenial mood; for a swap out - of my original Amazing Amazon Attachment to an email - I've been sent one each replacement wired ear bud stereo connecter! HOW SWEET is that story! Now, for a REVIEW of the actual device: Sturdily packaged ez to read and assimilate instruction manual, all pieces separately packed, zip-lock baggie for the ear-gels, nothing drops to the floor when you dive in; it's an ez ensemble to assemble. Sound is straight up NICE! I have nothing thin or tinny; mine was a straight up bass bumpin playa. Even with the loss of volume adjustment in the attached stereo bud NOW, it's every bit as good as a mid volume rig. Pairing was a snap, instant location and match up with my Moto Q 9C, no sweat. Only complaint is my actual listening time on a full charge is running out at about 4.5 hours. THAT'S why I'm back to treat myself to another! This time - I located extra stereo connection buds 1st (on the BAY, eh), right at 4 bux a pop (ordered two), then I came slidin back in here - to see the price has risen 10 smackers since just 2 weeks back when I made my first purchase. Why does a guy need this amount of non stop music? Because ol dude has a rough time trying to sleep. 8 hours is about enough to get me all the way through the night with 2 different sessions of Binaural Brainwave Doses (Yup, I'ma DOSER! TRUE BELIEVER TYPE too): Alpha, Theta, Delta, Lucid Dreams, Astral Projection, have a soothing sip of Absinth, throw back down into Delta, beep beep beep - time to change to the powered up headset!

I know that it stated that some cell carrier's features may not work, but it also stated that it was compatible with several different carriers, one of which was mine. I could not receive pic messages, only texts. Also, I could not use this phone in my house, I had to step outside to get reception. Maybe it was just a lemon. I've had a RAZR company phone in the past and liked it very well. So, when I got tired of my personal phone, I decided to get this one. I immediately regretted it.

"After 6 months, this thing suddenly stopped sending sound from me to the phone, so while I can hear the other caller, they can't hear me at all. What's crazy is that I replaced it under warranty, and the same exact failure happened again 6 months later! So clearly something is wrong with these units. The only reason I'm giving 2 stars and not 1 is because I really like the design. If I have an incoming call, I can flip out the boom, and put it on the ear quickly while it is connecting to the phone. It also answers the call automatically if turned on while a call is incoming. Putting it on the ear with one hand is super easy. The result is that you can use it ""on demand"", even while driving. I cannot find any other brand that can turn on/put on/answer call quickly enough not to miss the call. I'm actually very torn, should I give it another try? I just hate that it fails so quickly!",negative

I got this unit because they told me it had better reception than most. Well it does get static in it when I get away from the phone itself. Also the on button slides into on while it is in my purse.

"This case was delivered as promised. Overall, I'm satisfied with it since I prefer a case with this form factor. Also, the case material is quite good, but I have two problems with it. First, the TX doesn't slide down all the way into the case so that the button cut-out hangs slightly too low over the top of the buttons for my taste. Second, the belt clip was rather flimsy. After using it for two weeks, it no longer secures the TX strongly to the belt and the device can be easily slipped off (i.e., by a thief) because the metal band warped slightly after ordinary use. Fortunately, the case is compatible with similar clips from other vendors.",neutral
"I was excited to get this phone, it replaced my T721. It is in a beautiful case and plenty of features like the camara, bluetooth, etc. However, the phone is not very responsive.

So I called Motorola about it, if I want it looked at I need to send it to them and they will return it to me in (get this) 4-6 weeks. Which pretty much makes the warrenty useless for my purposes.

I decided to get a full strip since I have a bunch of quartz watches, and this is a fairly common size. I'll probably use 3-4 before they all go dead.

I know this because the song starts and then after a second or two then I'll start hearing the audio. These are especially bad when trying to watch Netflix or any other video. The sound is behind 1 to 2 seconds. I also had trouble with trying to restore to factory settings or default settings. I followed the instructions which say to push all four buttons after turning off Bluetooth in the phone and turning on the device and nothing happened even though I held the buttons for at least 60 seconds straight.",negative
"Nothing in the product description prepared me for the surprise of finding that this product is a ""Communication Set for Her."" It comes complete with a pink earbud, and the packaging is rife with gender specific marketing cues, all of which have been curiously and misleadingly eliminated from the Amazon materials, yes I went I back and looked. I guess the little design highlight curlicues on the silver body may have been a clue, but they are much more prominent on the actual unit than in the picture. The unit itself is also curious. It comes with a ridiculous charging case so that is an extra thing that you are going to have to take with you when you travel, and the charger itself is gigantuan. So to be clear, there is no way to charge this thing without the superfluous case. One more thing to carry, break, or lose. Too much junk to keep track of. It also comes with a bunch of adapters for foreign power supplies. How strange. And a nice silver cloth pouch with matching design curlicues. And a great big full booklet manual with super tiny print. The unit works passably well for one without noise reduction. On a test call my wife was able to understand me over the stereo playing at comfortable listening volume, however she could clearly hear the music in the background. I could hear her fine. About par for the course for an inexpensive unit. It paired easily with my smartphone and has intuitive controls.",neutral

"Since it is now illegal to drive around while operating a phone, it's an alternative to using an earpiece, I have not much success with a couple different earpieces. Overall it works good, but sometimes difficult to hear some people talk (too soft). I think it depends on the others' phones and how loud they are talking. Sometimes others will hear an echo. I had no problems with the phone downloading all my numbers and names and the ST3 does a good job in saying the persons' names, so I like that feature a lot. Since I have had problems with most of my earpieces sitting in my ear comfortably, I like that it just sits on the visor. And when I put my visor down, I slide the unit around easily (it's on magnets). Since half stars aren't given, I'd give this a 3.5 star rating or a little higher, but not quite a 4. We'll see if it can withstand the test of time, heat from being in the armrest storage during the days and can continue to operate properly.",neutral
"On the plus side, it has excellent voice quality, good ergonomics, and is easy to use. Thankfully the detachable ear bracket isn't necessary except in active situations (exercising, etc.). The included accessories (unique ""micro-usb"" neck lanyard, carrying pouch and extra ear gels) are a nice bonus. Generally it's a good headset but on the negative side, I've noticed it is prone to annoying static when used outdoors. This occurs frequently but never when used inside the car. I have experienced this type of interference with older Plantronics sets as well. Range is average at best. My previous LG headset had much stronger reception towards the fringe of the 30' radius. I purchased the unit primarily for communication, however the ""stereo"" feature is certainly convenient. That said, if you're into ""quality"" audio, even the cheapest wired earbuds will sound better. Overall, I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend this unit. I'll probably hang with it for a year or so and eventually replace it.",neutral
"Given 1 star for the easy access to songs/artist/albums/shuffle, and another for decent battery life and the mini usb/usb charging capabilities. It's all down hill from there. I must warn all of you, the phone I bought from hasselfree(or whatever they changed their name to) came shipped to me as a Russian phone. Russian text on the keys(just looks lame). I feel like a complete idiot for buying this phone. However, I was desperite and needed one fast and thought, ""why not for 100 bucks"". This might not bother some, but the listed images reflecting the item purchased is not correct. Firmware updates are not available from Motorola. T-Mobile updates are not available. You'll have to do some research in order to find the correct settings for your phone. Took me about a week. My previous phones were all synched seemlessly intergrated. This phone also has TONS of lag when browsing through menus. Doesn't matter what type, but I have found that, bluetooth will only add to the delay. The other thing I was gonna add is fact that the phone is in RUSSIAN. What's really weird about this phone is the speakerphone. While playing music, it's great(for a phone) but during a phone call, it's average. The speakerphone volume changes, why? I dunno. But it does, and it disapointed me as soon as I tried using it for a phone call. Couldn't find any setting to try and tweak it. Bluetooth connections with headset pieces are sad compared to my last two phones, z6 and samsung. Lots of digital static as if the phone was 20' or 30' away even though the ear piece and phone are less than 4' away from each other(cell in pocket/bluetooth headset in ear). I've used this phone for a more than 4 months and haven't had too many problems. The cell phone's reception compared to the two previous phones is a 7/10. I used to get a solid reception in my bedroom, now I have to go outside and stand infront of a planter in order to NOT drop a call. Though the expandable memory and internal memory sound like a plus. The phone's internal system just added to the lag. I kept everything on the SD card. Thought this phone should have been called the lag. Even with a brebone system with 1 mp3 on it, the phone still lags. Really sad because this phone really looks cool! 9/19/09 I just added the data plan, omg... one thing to say... NEVER BUY A RANDOM UNLOCKED PHONE ever ever ever... Saving a few bucks just isn't worth the headache... buy the real thing. Hasslefree or whatever they call themselves now asked why in an automated email... ""what can we do to help you?"" full well knowing the crap they were selling. This phone is just 100% pure jacked up. EVERYTHING needs to be reset to a factory default that isn't available ANYWHERE! You're going to be the one researching/plugging in everything... on your own. In all, screw this phone. It looks awesome! but yeah... most guys/girls that I know don't twitter their junk to a outdated cell phone. At most, this phone is worth 40 bucks...",negative

I also could not check my email; I kept getting error messages. The phone was an AT&T phone, and even after I configured it for my carrier, it still didn't work right. I suspect this may have been a refurbished phone, even though it was advertised as ""new"". I think these phones are hit or miss. Let the buyer beware!",negative

"This headset worked very well with my mobile. I find it comfortable to wear when making or receiving calls. The audio quality in my opinion is good for making calls, but it does appear to be difficult in an environment with an abundance of external noises. Incoming call audio is good and there is limited amounts of time that one may encounter hearing the incoming callers voice. Overall I would say this Bluetooth Headset is a good investment and is a viable product for those looking for a new or replace for their current Bluetooth Headset.",neutral

"Ok, let's get this straight. Just because a phone drops calls/won't dial successfully, doesn't make it the phone's fault. Cingular may claim that they have the least dropped calls but most of the problems occur when Cingular won't even let you dial out. Call QUALITY is based on the phone, not dropped calls. PROS... The phone is aesthetically built, and looks very nice. I like the functions available to the user without even opening the phone (flip style). I can access mp3s, video camera, and normal camera from the outer controls. I personally prefer the standard raised keys which the CU500 has over ones such as the flat RAZR buttons. Good quality for phone calls, and easy-to-use interface. CONS... Nothing else is included when buying the phone except the charger. The USB data cable, microSD memory card, and headsets are all extra. Really stupid especially since the onboard memory is 16MB, pathetic when it features a 1.3 megapixel camera. *I've had no problems with my microSD memory card, although others have. I'd make sure to buy Sandisk memory, which LG endorses. Annoying ring notification when selecting settings and basically doing ANYTHING on this phone. I'm going to search for a software/firmware update to solve this problem, hopefully LG addresses this.",positive

"When the charger for the phone broke I knew the only place I could get it was online since the phone is what some would call a ""dinosaur"". I ordered this and received it within the estimated time frame and it was the right charger! Sometimes when ordering online the picture and even the label of the item is different then what you end up getting in the mail. I've had this experience several times with other sellers. This was not the case here. The charger is working well so far so I don't yet know if the claims of it stopping after 3 months will prove true or not but so far so good. If anything goes haywire, I'll be sure to post a follow-up review.",neutral
"At first it was the best clip ever, but it is not very durable.

If your not doing heavy duty work, this is an excellent phone case.",neutral
"First off, the headset is only $20 if purchased with a Sony Ericsson T610. For that much, this is a must buy. The concept is wonderful, and it works well for the most part. I can speak wirelessly with my phone elsewhere. The headset itself is comfortable - especially the eargel. It fits snugly and sound is clear. Two gripes, however: 1) Battery life is less than impressive. Jabra claims 3 hrs. I have yet to get beyond 2. In fact, last night when I used it, I got a warning signal at exactly 1:51. 2) Bluetooth range is 30 feet only when in a clear path. My bathroom is 15 feet away. I get noticeable static on my end. If I close the door, everything becomes unintelligble. The interesting thing is that the person on the other end doesn't seem to notice a thing. All in all, it's a great concept and works well aside from the two gripes listed above. I recommend it.",neutral

"I bought this to replace a universal model mounted to my air vent. It came with a slim manual (normal these days... at least it was included in print). Really liked that it had an extension piece for the arm and all the parts connected by nice strong ball joints that let me position the iPhone 3GS exactly where I want it and in portrait or landscape mode. I used the suction cup mount to attach to the windshield with NO PROBLEMS what-so-ever. Didn't have to press hard when dialing down the suction cup and its never came off while driving. Its used in a Ford Escape. The problems others are having could be due to different curvatures in windshields possibly or maybe bad example shipped. Its also possible their windshields aren't clean which could also be an issue. It does come with a sticky padded disc mount should you prefer to mount to a dash instead too. The cradle for the iPhone holds it nicely. It almost snaps in place and pops out to assure its secure position. Sure it doesn't allow a case to be used but could you imagine making the cradle adapt to so many different cases? Or it would have to rely on a universally adjustable arms to hold it like my previous mount. That's more messing around when putting in and pulliing it out of the cradle and I prefer the quick pop in and out method. It also frees up the top and bottom for power charger connection and headphone jack access. Actually, you can access all the controls easily. What would make this better? Maybe add a sync connector that employs power and audio out signals that can be hard wired through back of dash. Add a nice slim hardshelled case that comes with adapter that works with case for arm sold seperately (More money Griffin! Wake up your marketing team!). Overall I highly recommend. Great product at a good price.",positive
"I expected more. I live in an area of very weak cell phone signals. I have to leave my house and walk up a hill to acquire a signal, so I know they're here only very weak, It boosted the signal; inside my garage from zero to one bar and sometimes two bars fleetingly. It is not reliable enough to place a phone call and two thirds of the time I have to resend texts. If I could go back to the moment when I decided to buy it, I wouldn't and save myself the money.",negative
Makes the headset 5x better as far as sound quality and overall fit/comfort. Get rid of that hook for good and enjoy the headset as it was intended... You can find the gels on e Ba Y as well as the Jabra website...As for the bluetooth piece...I just got mine last night.

"The case seems well made, but the little things are either not thought through or not manufactured to spec. The fit overall is reasonably snug, but since the bezel on the Note is so thin, there is precious little non-screen real estate on the sides, and the case could have benefited from more stiffness in that area. As it is, it just bulges to the left and right. The bottom strip also bulges in the middle. The microphone on the Note is a small hole on the bottom of the casing; the case has a round piece punched out for it, but it's not quite centered on the hole. You have to wiggle the phone and/or stretch the leather from time to time to keep it open. On the other hand, the cutout around the USB/charger connector is huge (at least three times its width). There is no (I repeat, no) way to connect the earpiece or headphones to the top jack when the flap is closed. Apparently, designers did not expect Note owners to listen to music or the radio while the phone is in their pocket (or to have a long conversation hands-free). Nothing that 5 minutes with an X-acto won't fix, of course. Also (this concerns only the vendor, not the product), Prime members should not put their trust in the ""two-day shipping"". I ordered the item on Friday night, received a shipping estimate for Wednesday, and it finally arrived on Thursday. Six days cannot count as two under any definition of the term.",neutral

"This was a Christmas gift for my wife - her first bluetooth hands free headset. Very small, very sleek, very stylish - all the things an Italian woman craves - form over function. I liked the fact that it has ""military"" technology regarding noise cancellation. However, it is so tiny that the fit is diffucult for her to adjust, and the tiny little white rubber nub must be touching your cheek (or jawbone, hence the name) in order for it to have really good voice quality and to take full advantage of the noise cancelling abilities. Also, due to its sleek design, it only has two buttons that are ""hidden"" that must control all functions. This makes for a stylish cool look, but tricky to operate (although after a while with repeated use you'll get used to it). My advice: Buy this headset - but buy it with a good return policy just in case you find it too difficult to use. If you love style and techie things, and you will use this all day every day, then you'll probably like the product. Just make sure you buy it from a store that will allow returns/exchanges just in case it's not your fit. We also looked at the top of the line Plantronics headset, which came with a tiny little carrying case that had a built in battery for recharging. So you could carry it in your purse and the headset could recharge - very nice portable feature that this Jawbone does not offer.",positive

"Great microphone, people on the phone say they can hear me great. However, I have difficulty hearing people if I'm on the highway and I cannot hear the speaker ring if I have music on when someone calls me. The light indicators on this thing are not clear at all during the day (not bright enough) but this is not a big deal. It connects to my Treo 750 just fine with no glitches, and I can voice dial thru this device. Overall, it's a very good product that needs a better higher speaker volume, even if this sacrifices some talk time on the battery life. Summary: Pros: Great microphone clarity, great connection ease, very nice looking, and so thin it can fit anywhere in your car. Cons: Biggest issue: low speaker volume. Minor issues: light indicators are not bright enough during the day and wish that the visor clip can be removed so I can put this flat on the dashboard if I wanted to without having to cut the clip.",neutral
"I have used the Plantronics Voyager 510 for about six months now, and have linked it to two different phones (Verizon VX6700 and Motorola Razor2 V9M) with no problems whatsoever. Contrary to some reviewers, I've found the battery life to be better than expected. I can usually go a few days without recharging the headset (with moderate daily use). Last week, I used the headset to make a call while on my bicycle traveling at 15 MPH, and the other party had no idea that I was talking hands-free and under a helmet. Sound quality (both ways) is exceptional, and I've never experienced a dropped call/connection. The user-interface on the headset (buttons, LED, ear buds, etc.) work well for such a small form factor, even with big hands/fingers. I've even dropped the unit a few times (@ <= 6 feet) and it hasn't broken or had pieces pop off. Overall, a high quality unit with excellent features at a reasonable price. Highly recommended.",positive
"DO NOT buy this phone unless you're willing to endure continuous calls from Verizon Wireless if you try to close your account.

Doing a *69 revealed they were coming from 1-800-470-0768, Verizon Wireless' number. Calling a supervisor (Jasen) resulted in an apology and him putting me on their Do Not Call list, which he says won't take effect for 30 days. He also said this is a ""known problem with Verizon's auto-dialer"" for which Verizon has no solution. It's only noon and so far today I've gotten three calls from them, two hangups and another sales pitch to upgrade my phones and stay with Verizon Wireless. I'd rather stick needles in my eyes.",negative
"This is the 3rd headset I've owned. By far this is the most comfortable. Its small size and light weight makes it easy to wear for long times. The one down side is my car. I have a sports car which transmits a lot of road noise into the cabin. The DSP in the Jabra does an OK job, but at times it is hard for people to hear me over the noise. I can hear the conversation in the head set perfectly though. In my girlfriend's VW Passat the cabin is quiet enough that the headset works beautifully. In fact, some people have commented that the sound is better than using the phone's own pickup. 4 out of 5 stars only because it can't handle noisy environments as good as the ""DSP"" labeling on the package would lead you to believe.",positive

"I've had this little gem for a few weeks now, and so far I have to say that it's the best headset I've used yet, and like many, I've gone through a few. Incidently, I'm using with an HTC 8125 smart phone, and it connected with no trouble whatsoever. PROS: * extremely light * good volume, even when driving (windows up, noisy car) * easy to use * good reference guide * easily usable for right or left ear (I use the left ear) * I'm guessing, but should work well with any Bluetooth capable phone * affordable * can be a good distance from the phone and still converse (15-20 feet before the static kicks in) * long standby battery life (I sometimes go 3-4 days without charging, that includes mild talking as well) CONS: * once in a while there's a little static even when close to the phone, but it's white noise for me at this point * at first, I found it odd to get it on my ear, as it sits _ON_ the ear, not _IN_ the ear ... after a couple different approaches, easy breezy Overall, two thumbs up ... I like it so much, I've talked a couple people into getting it and they love it! If you want a great wireless headset for your cell, buy this one ... Sony Ericsson got it right!",positive

From time to time, I lose connection with my phone.

In any case, I can highly recommend the Jabra headset.",positive
"I ""upgraded"" from an old nokia 6010 that was working perfect for over 4 years to a LG cu500 That can't even stay connected for more than a minute! Dropped calls like crazy. People on the other end keep hanging up on me because they could not hear me! HELLO? HELLO? HELLO? And the 3G Hipe that cingular keeps pushing is NO GOOD as well. I signed up for the full media package with video and all the bells and whistles and the video would go into buffer zone forever after playing about 15 seconds of a 3 min clip. This was my second CU500 phone from cingular. New sim card, new phone, same problems. My signal was always 5 bars strong in the 3g mode, yet, still dropped calls and nobody could hear me. My best guess about this phone is that LG rushed this phone to market to compete with the razor from motorola.(As we all know that the razor is always sold out at the cingular stores.) I would not recommend this phone to anybody who needs a reliable source of communication. Cell phone quality has dropped in the last 4 years since I brought a phone, so I can't really recommend any brands. Cingular service has been PERFECT so far before I brought this phone so go figure what's the problem. There is another reviewer on this page having the same problems as I did as well.",negative

I had the impression that the Garmin would have a better set of PIO's than the TomTom. Unfortunately, I was wrong. On first use, the Garmin routed me to a warehouse instead of a retail store and then routed me to a store in another town when trying to go to a different store that had existed for years in the city I was in.

"I bought this phone to replace a Treo 600. The 600 was a terrible phone. It had a buzz when used as a phone. This is a very good phone and great pda. There are hundreds of programs for it. I researched the 680 and the BlackJack. I have the Cingular 8125 as my work phone. I'm very pleased I went with the Treo. It is so much easier to use and can be used with one hand. The windows phone I use at work requires the stylist to do most anything. You can easily use the keyboard on the 680 with one hand for text messages. There are a lot of programs for the Treo. When I first got the phone it went into a constant loop after I tried to sync with my old Treo 600 software. Cingular wasn't much help. I got on Palm's website and went to the knowledge base found the problem and followed the easy instructions and I was back up and running. The speakerphone is also good. I talked for 2 hours on it and the party I was talking told me it was very clear when I told her I was using the speakerphone and ask her how it sounded. The only big negative I've found with the phone is the battery. I guess that is true with all the smart phones these days. The second negative would have to be the camera. It is improved over the 600, but still not near as good as most of the other camera phones. No more than I talk on the phone I can recharge it at night and I'm fine, but if someone talks all day long they should plan on having a second battery and charger. Unless you need to watch streaming TV over the wireless network, need a better camera, or long battery life I think you will love the Treo 680. For Palm phone users you will like not having the antenna, but without getting it out of the old Treo cases is much harder. This is a great pda, a very good phone, a fair camera, mp3 player and a pretty good video player. I bought some DVD software at palmgear and I slapped a DVD in my laptop and set the size I wanted it cut to for my SD card and created a movie. I loaded it on my SD card and it plays great on the 680. This is a great device and for the money and would be very hard to beat. Where else can you get an mp3 player, video player, pda, phone and have hundreds of programs that are inexpensive to expand it's value? You can add a car navigation to that list if you buy the available bundle. This is old Palm technology and very solid. For me it amazing to get so much for the price. The problems with the Treo 600 are fixed in this device. I much prefer it to my Windows based Cingular 8125. It doesn't have the 3rd generation network of the Palm 700's, the Blackjack or Cingular 8525, but if you don't download alot of data or need streaming video, this should be the phone you compare everything else to.",positive
"Design is OK, but quality is so so. I bought two CU920 at the same time. One often shuts down automatically once I plug in a 2GB MicroSD card(that card is good for sure). The replacement for this phone works well, but has defects on the paint. Another phone shuts down automatically after 3 months use, but works well without the MicroSD. Again the MicroSD works great on the other CU920. Even re-calibrated, the precision and consistent sensitivity of the touch screen is far from iPhone and iTouch. Dial someone in the contact list is fine, but if you dial through the pad for some codes and phone numbers, you are very likely to mistype or double type digits. Today I found one pin of connector of the earphone was bent. The tiny design of the connector is prone to damage. And when you has the connector on, it is really hard to adjust the volume since the connector blocks half the side button for volume adjustment. This is a phone, but those annoying things make the major function downgraded.",negative

"The Motorola HT820 Bluetooth headset is a great product. Audio quality is surprisingly good and pairing with multiple Motorola phones have been simple. Range is also good as I have been able to walk around my living room and kitchen (~30ft) with no loss in signal. The button locations on the left and right side of the headset were great and actually very useful especially in answering calls and changing tracks when listening to music. There are a few things that I would like to comment on though and may be something that Motorola should consider. There is no audio adjustment (bass, treble, etc)and the unit borders on ""bulky"". Also volume is controlled not through the phone, but through the headset so maximum volume is somewhat limited. I was able to hear audio fine in the house, but it is very difficult to hear lower frequencies when riding in some cars. Other than that I think it still was a good deal for the money and I am still enjoying the product.",positive

"To be fair, I did not mount this on my roof as is the suggested way to install it for the best performance. I did not want to drill holes in my roof or in my house walls to put a cable through. I installed it on an inside window. From there, it did not boost the signal any better then the Wilson sleek cradle booster does. I didn't want to keep my cell phone in a booster and use the bluetooth all the time, so was hoping this would allow me to make and receive calls holding my cell phone. With the window installation, it only worked if I stood right in front of the indoor antenna. And the cables you have to use are to big to try and hide behind furniture. I'll stick with the sleek.",neutral

"I mistakenly bought this international version to use in the US. So at first I had to change the language settings to English and search for an English manual online. This is a very basic phone, but so basic that I thought it went back to the early days of cell phone development. First, all your contacts on your sim card don't transfer neatly into the phone, the names are all messed up with upper case and lower case making it hard to read. The phone book is not very easy to use either. Then I don't even know what all the random number that shows up, is it a date? time? code? I don't even know how to reset the date and time. And the design and feel of the phone looks like a toy phone which we don't mind so much if it works. We don't use the text message feature on there so it doesn't matter if it has it, but if you buy it because there's a text message feature I don't know you should because it's so primitive. We also have a hard time figuring out the call history so if we missed a phone call we really missed it and wouldn't know who called us last. We gave up figuring out the phone and so we are buying another phone.",negative
"I bought this item thinking it would look just as it does in the picture, and it does, except they don't show you the 50' coax cord and 18"" antenna that hooks to it. I was disappointed that the best place I could get a signal was either having the antenna mounted to the front of my house or in the attic. I decided to keep it in the attic but I have yet to figure out how to run the cable down to my living room. I will say that I went from having 0-1 bars to 2-3 bars on my cell phone and I am now able to make and receive most calls. So yes, it does work, it is just not as easy to install as you would think.",neutral

Have experienced no problems and have yet to say, ""Man, I sure wish it could...""

"I purchased the red version of this headset to go with my red Samsung a707 SYNC phone. The color matched up perfectly. Had no issues with pairing this headset up with my phone. I made a test call to my home and left a message on voicemail. Listened to the message, which sounded fine. The two issues I had with this unit: 1) During a call, what I was hearing in the earpiece seemed like it was cutting in and out...or maybe more like the volume was going up and down. It wasn't real bad to the point of me not being able to hear it at all or not understand, but it was somewhat annoying. 2) THE THING WON'T STAY IN MY EAR!!!!! I noticed that several people had mentioned this in their reviews, but I thought I'd give it a try anyway. It comes with small, medium, and large interchangeable covers for the earpiece. The small is installed when you take the unit out of the package, and the medium and large pieces were packaged separately in the box. I tried all three and none worked any better than the others. I also tried in my left ear, as I saw one reviewer mention that it stayed in when he used it in his left ear but not his right. The left ear didn't work any better. It stays in my right ear for a little while, and then just all of a sudden drops out. Couldn't get it to stay in my left ear at all. I have absolutely no clue what purpose the ""hook"" (that's what Samsung calls it) serves. That's the loop you see on top of the earpiece in the pictures. It doesn't hook onto anything. I guess it's somehow supposed to make the fit in your ear a little more snug, but did absolutely nothing for me. I've already printed out my return label from Amazon and will be sending this back ASAP.",neutral

"I have used my new H700 for about a week. First off, beware of counterfeit units: I first went with a low priced unit and found it was counterfeit when I examined it using Motorola's handbook on counterfeit models. Performance was poor (lots of static). The second purchase yielded a genuine product and the performance is much better. (HOwever, even this unit came with a European charger. I had to call the vendor to request a US version. Man, internet vendors can be a real pain!) A comment on versions: I read alot of posts that described A, B and C versions with the C version supposedly optimized for CDMA type phones. But after a few calls to Motorola (the first tech support guy had no idea there were even different versions) and some emails, I found out that the only difference between the versions is some details in the pairing procedure. All are supposed to be compatible with any Bluetooth phone - no special versions for CDMA phones, etc. Performance of the headset seems solid: good audio quality for both sides of the phone conversation. I haven't really tested the Bluetooth range but it works fine while driving with the unit on my left ear and the phone about 4 feet to my right on the passenger seat. I don't have enough use to really comment on battery life, but the charger is SLOW. It takes over two hours to get a full charge. The multi colored LED on the headset is helpful to know what the unit is doing (pairing, charge progress, etc). My biggest gripe about this model: Motorola blew it in terms of ease of use. The unit is turned on by unfolding the boom mike from the headset body, (a big improvement over older moto headsets where you need to hold down the main button for a few seconds until it recognizes that you want to toggle power). However the headset must be off your ear to flip the boom out: the boom is facing your face and the ear hook is folded closed when the unit is turned off. In my opinion, it would have been much better if the boom hinge was on the outside of the unit. Then you could wear it on your ear with the unit off to save battery power, and flip the boom out when you hear the phone ring to quickly activate the headset to take the call. You Moto guys listening?",neutral

"I bought this screen protector for my q9c and I must say, I am pretty happy with it. It fits very well and was pretty easy to put on. The only thing I don't care for is how easy it is to leave smudges all over the protector. My protector didn't come with a squeegee, but the silicone backing means you don't really need it. If you realize you have a little dust under the protector, apply a strip of scotch tape to the corner closest to the dust, slip the point of an exacto blade CAREFULLY between the screen and protector to get it started a little, lift up a bit with the tape, and remove the dust from the protector with the sticky side of a piece of scotch tape. Then carefully reapply the protector from center to corner, remove the tape, and remove any tape residue with a microfiber cloth. These are far better quality than the 3m protectors, and A LOT easier to apply than the invisible shield.",positive

"I bought this for my wife thinking I could make a few ringtones for her and sync up her contacts on her profile. My problem is that although it works, there is almost no guidelines for creting ringtones. I found an article online that explained how to create ringtones for my wife's phone. I couldn't believe after buying this package that all it offered for an explanation was a vague error message when you tried to load an MP3 that wasn't sampled correctly. I have it working now, but as a professional programmer I must say that a typical low-level user would never get personalized ringtones loaded on the phone. This is unacceptable; since I know programmically it isn't all that hard to do the resample on the fly. Motorola didn't do this, I believe, to drive the typical user into buying ringtones out of the confusion of how to create them. So if you understand how to resample MP3s, and how use an encoder / decoder then this is a fine package. Otherwise, wait till they do something better.",neutral
"Stupidly, I spent $900 on this phone the very week it was made available for sale in the U.S., and then I bought a second one as a gift. The phone kept turning itself off automatically, even when loaded with a fully charged battery. So Nokia sent me a replacement phone (number 1), which had some loose schmutz under the screen. So Nokia sent me another replacement phone (number 2), whose keypad backlighting did not illuminate whenever I opened the slide. So Nokia sent me another replacement phone (number 3), which automatically and inexplicably lost its WAP settings every time I had to switch the phone off. So Nokia sent me yet another replacement phone (number 4), which slid open too far on its very first use, exposing the wiring and circuitry and rendering it impossible to use. So Nokia -- God bless them -- sent me one more replacement phone (number 5), which I have been using for just over one week now and which no longer makes a keypad tone whenever I dial the 3, 6, 9, or # keys. The phone looks and feels sleek, yes. The charging base emanates a pulsating blue light. The ringtones, composed by Ryuichi Sakamoto, are beautiful. But this phone is a colossal waste of money: all style with no substance. The battery lasts a pitifully short length of time before needing to be recharged. The interface is unattractive and confusing, with various phone functions located counterintuitively in menus where you would never think to search. Incoming text and multimedia messages appear not on a plain, easy-to-read white screen, but rather in plain black text on whatever multicolored theme you happen to have selected, often making the content of such messages impossibly hard to read. Instructions in the user's manual are vague and not at all helpful. This phone is proof that you don't always get what you pay for. No matter what the asking price, it's garbage.

"This Wireless Blue Tooth Headset has awesome sound and it is relatively easy to you. I worked for it if they had cloth type covering instead of the fake leather or less sweating, but it isn't that bad (summer is coming though). They should also have changeable ear piece covers, see that fake leather covering eventually cracking. And if they were cloth and changeable then you could wash them. Where is the confusion? Well it is with pairing. You hold in the phone button for pairing either the phone or the music source causing confusion in the device or at least in me. I would suggest that the company make the phone button for the phone pairing and the music button for the music source pairing. I install my phone like it says and then I try the computer for music I hear music, but I can't control windows media player to review said they were able to do, but also then the phone un-paired. And back and forth. I am wondering is because I have a music phone that the headset is thinking well you have music and phone. Not sure. I plan on keeping them though.

"These of course work like they should. They're clear and NOT matte so that's a huge plus. I'm really picky about my screen protectors and when they come precut There's always one corner that's not being reached and it just pisses me off so I prefer these bad boys because I can cut them myself. The graph on the opposite side definitely helps when cutting and makes sure you're cutting straight. If you love little project building with your hands, you're going to love putting your screen protector on. Tip: Youtube how to do it. If you don't have patience, repetitiveness, or simple eye hand coordination, you'll hate these and should look for those precut ones. Don't expect to put it on without bubbles the first time. It takes practice. I've put on about less than ten screen protectors in my life and each time I get less and less bubbles. So expect them! And you'll see that you'll get bubbles no matter the brand. And with ten screens to go through at less than a buck each, you should have plenty of practice. Sadly, the only con to these is that they don't cover my entire screen of my Evo4g. you could get away with just covering the lighted part of the screen and leave the 'home, menu, back, and find' uncovered, but I like the whole thing covered. Oh well at least they weren't expensive. five stars tip: if you have dust in there use two pieces of tape to get it out. first one on top to peel the screen off slightly, the other piece of tape, sticky side facing dust, dab, peel off, done!

"I have a fairly new (AT&T) Motorola V3r, and the software works fine. Considering it can be purchased for under 10 bucks, it is well worth it. I cannot understand the negative reviews. The only shortcomings are that data transfers are kind of slow, and it is not very intuitive. It takes a little searching for the right command until you become familiar with the functions. After a few days experience, it becomes easy to use. Entering phonebook and calendar items are much easier than using the phone's keypad. The ability to back-up the phone's data on a PC is very reassuring. I would hate to re-enter it all if the phone gets stolen, damaged, or lost.",positive

"I'd like to point out I've never tried another Bluetooth headset, perhaps all Bluetooth headsets are terrible quality and this is the best on the market. That being said I did not enjoy this headset. There are a lot more ""what did you say?"" moments on BOTH ends of the phone. I couldn't here her and she couldn't hear me. I was often asked to stop using the headset. However it did work, if both ends spoke loudly and clearly it worked perfectly, but who wants to be that meticulous while talking on the phone?",negative

"I bought this in hopes of saving money by not buying the ""official"" PS3 Headset, and I'm very happy. This headset will work very well with the Playstation 3. I can't directly compare it to the official one, but it's very good. Notes: I do NOT use this with a cell phone. I do NOT really move around much with this in my ear. I do wear it for consecutive hours on end. I sit about 8 feet from my Playstation 3 and the sound quality is very good. Because I don't move much, I don't use the little ear hook, I just stick this directly in my ear and I can run to the bathroom between rounds and it's yet to fall into the toilet. It's not actually fallen out of my ear at any point. However, my ear does get a little uncomfortable after having this in it for a couple of hours, but I'm not sure that any other ear piece would be better. Setting it up / pairing was very easy. Just make sure and read the instructions about how long to hold the button to make the headset enter 'pairing mode'. Everything else is handled by the Playstation. I would recommend this for any PS3 owner who wants to save some money. As of this writing, this is about half the price of the official one.",positive

"Pros: - Turns on/off with the flip - Very comfortable in my ears, but I don't know for other people. - Last enough for every day use, I'm on the phone all day long (around 8 hours) and didn't have to recharge it Cons: - Might turn on by mistake because the flip part flips too easily - After using few months (hopefully one year and something) you might have to buy another one because people won't hear you very well - Duh! there's not even anything to hang it when not in use. I had to invent myself a thing to hang it when I don't use it.",negative
"It could be great. The good: -It easily turns on and off with the folding mic. -The audio is really good. The not so good: -Wind distortion is pretty bad. -It swings on my ear. This is due to the mic creating an unfair balance for the hook. If the thing would fit in the ear, it would not swing. If you torque it right, it won't swing too much. The rubber will on the bluetooth will stick then. I don't consider bonding an issue, but it could be. Hold the button in and immediately flip open the mic just in case.",neutral

Complaints? One. That goldurn LED. Others have mentioned it - I have to as well. What the frickety-fracking heck were Plantronics thinking?

"I was looking for a basic phone for calls and text while I find a real phone, which is unlocked and international. I have T-mobil international plan, but the phone didn't work in Europe. It doesn't have an out box in text messages, it is hard to read and write text because of the large font words often appear partially. If you are in an area with no reception it may take sometimes as much as 10 minutes for the sim card to work. Sometimes for no reason my sim card couldn't be recognized so I have to take the battery out remove and re-install the sim card for it to start working again. Sometimes the phone just ""lights up"" reading ""t-mobil"" on it. All in all, it's more like a somewhat sophisticated child's toy than a phone.

"When I was looking for a bluetooth headset, I came to Amazon.com to check out the reviews. This bluetooth seemed to get really good reviews. So, I ordered it. The first one that was sent to me was the wrong model. No problem, accidents happen. The second one arrived and was the correct model. I paired the headset with my Blackberry Curve 8330 and tried it out. I could hear the person on the other end really good. The volume was great! The earpiece is very comfortable and lightweight. Did not bother me at all to wear it. So, me being able to hear the caller was one definite PLUS. But..... that's only half the reason to use a bluetooth. I proceeded to use the ""voice commands"". It could not understand one thing I told it to do. That is not a huge deal for me. So, I dialed my wife and she said she could hear me ""OK"" but not real clear. I spoke louder with the same results. I then took it to work and wore it all day. I am on my phone alot and this is not my first bluetooth. I finally got tired of having to repeat everthing I said and took the bluetooth off figuring I would try it the next day. Well, the next day came and I had the same results! I love the fact that I can hear callers but I cannot accept the fact that they can not hear me. They can always hear ALL of the background noises, but my voice is not clear. On my older Motorola bluetooth this was not a problem but I was hoping to use a smaller model. Guess I will have to drag the older one out and stick with it. Too bad, because I really like the size, comfort, looks, and volume of this one!",neutral
"To Floopy. Strong sound. Not as clear as I would have thought. Not as clear as the Jabra BT125. Not as comfortable as Jabra BT125. I am sending it back now and ordering a higher quality Jabra, to hopefully overcome the slight echo and wind interference with the Jabra 125. The key for me is fit. It must fit right or it is not in the contention. I think that Jabra makes the best fitting devices. So far... the Moto and the LG have been to floppy. Volume controls on the H710 are not easy to use and you can not tell if you are increasing or decreasing the volume. H710 has lots of colors to know about what they mean. Must be more simple. Sound breaks up. I think the dsp is working to hard and it actually degrades the sound if the ambient sound is not in the parameters that it is designed for. Sitting on a soft sofa absorbed to much sound for the mic to get a clear signal to a friend. Moving to a room with reflecton cleared it up. Again, much to floppy on my ear. Maybe it will fit your ear better!",neutral
"I've always had problems with other BT headsets. Mostly bad audio and pain around my ear from the weight of them. I finally stumbled on this headset which was designed for truckers who are always around noise in their job. The headset has great audio but the downside is the overall size of whole unit but personally I'm willing to overlook that for better sound. It's very comfortable when it's on your head. You get 2 different ear piece covers, one vinyl the other foam. If you don't wear it all the time putting it on does require 2 hands but it only takes a quick 2 seconds to flip it on.",positive

I think the main problem is with Sirius not the antenna.",neutral
"This is my third bluetooth and I'm really glad I found this one. My first one just gave up, the second one was static-ky. But this one is really clear with convenient volume control.

"I crossed my fingers and ordered this, even after I'd read the various warnings in other people's reviews. Unfortunately I had to return the dock, as my experience was also poor. The dock just isn't engineered right. Something is amiss that prevents a docked phone from charging or being recognized in iTunes. (And this isn't rocket science, after all; all this *should* be is simply a glorified sync cable.) Yes, I plugged into a computer USB jack and not a hub -- it didn't matter. Every now and then the phone would be recognized, but then I'd try again and there'd be nothing. I had high hopes for this little dock but its unreliability is far too frustrating.",negative

"This headset generally works, though there was times I needed to re-pair it. My problems with it that are: 1) Its hard to turn off - if you pay attention you can turn it off easy enough, but nothing like the Motorola H700 where you just flip the boom. 2) It's big! It's comfy enough on your ear, but its huge in your pocket and since things stick out of it, its hard to get out of your pocket. 3) Flashing blue light is way too bright! When is dark and I'm in the car, I keep thinking that the cops are behind me the way it blinks so brightly. It disturbed my passengers too. 4) Wind tolerance - it's better than my H700, but its still too noisy to hold a conversation in any level of wind. I'm sending mine back and getting another H700.",negative
"This phone came in new condition, and worked well. It is supposedly a ""US version,"" however many words are spelled as they would be in a European version. I also am unable to get the date and clock to function properly. Perhaps this is related to the previous problem. The battery also has a very poor charge-life. It hasn't lasted more then several hours before it needs recharged. I am forced to buy a new battery. The phone came quickly. I'm just disappointed it was not fully as described.",neutral
The reason I chose this headset was b/c it was inexpensive. I have had it now for a couple of weeks & I haven't had any problems with it. If you want a cheap bluetooth headset then this is the way to go.,positive
"I had the H850, which was one of the predecessors to this model. Loved it, but this model is much improved. It smaller, sturdier and has much better sound quality. However... It's the folding boom that makes this a 5 Star product for me. The H710 is more compact and comfortable than the old Moto folding headsets. This one is a much nicer fit, and nothing goes into your ear canal, so you can wear it without blocking out the sounds of the real world. The folding boom turns the unit off when it is closed. This saves battery, but best of all: If you've ever accidentally dialed someone while carrying your headset in a pocket/purse, this is the headset for you! The retail packaged product includes a mini-to micro usb adapter to convert your old Moto charger.",positive

"I've had the V-1 Blue ant for about 3 weeks. So far I consider it better than the last two I had. A Plantronics and a Samsung. It is better in sound quality and reception and noice reduction,than those other two. A few things though. The talk time is probably closer to 3 hours not 5. The standby time is also less than depicted. But still a decent product. There seems to be a little problem with the voice recognition also. It sometimes does not hear correctly and starts dialing a number incorrectly. I may send it back for another since it has a 2 yr. warranty.",neutral

"After reading several review, pros and cons I purchased the signal booster in hopes that I can use my cell phone as a second phone line in my home in south Jersey and at our condo in FL. I was going to test the signal booster in FL that has bad telephone reception and no 3G but didn't get down in January as planned. I set it up in my home where I have poor telephone signal and little or no 3G. The phone signal has improved from 1-3 bars to 3-4 (of 5) bars. The voice quality is better. I haven't cut the second phone line yet.

"Palm should have retained more of the features of its plain PDA OS, rather than trying to copy stupid interface features from Microsoft. Overall, NOT a great job, really. The reviews are quite unhelpful about the PDA applications. And battery standby life is about half of the 300 hrs specified in the description. I used to like the Palm OS, but... The OS now used by Palm in the Centro (and 680)is a screwed up version of what they have in their PDA's. For example, in Contacts, there is no longer a compact, single line, listing form. Instead, you must view all phone numbers for each entry on separate lines in the main listing. No choice. This means you can't see very many listings per page. Also, if you are not careful about entries, and put a word description with a phone number, you may just get a blank line. It used to be that word descriptors were just fine, as well as helpful. Blackberry has the more flexible and compact entry format that Palm used to have. Also the amount of information you can now enter for each number is more limited. Two steps backwards for Palm. Also, if you press a letter, such as ""J"" to see all the last name listings that start with ""J"", in alphabetical order, you are out of luck. It finds every bloody listing entry with a ""J"", whether it is first name or last, that you have to scroll through. This means fewer helpful listings per page. It means you can no longer enter a letter to skip that far down into the alphabetical listing, and if you enter something as specific as ""john"" to get to Johnson, you will go instead to first names listed as ""john"", assuming there are any in your contacts before Johnson. Also don't try to be cute and enter several letters such as ""jaa"" to go to the start of the ""j"" listings. The PDA will complain and not even let you scroll further down. The plain PDA OS does it sensibly and returns an alphabetical listing of last names starting with ""J"" if you entered a ""J"". And you could scroll from there all the way to Z if you so desired. One bug in the Treo 680 that has been fixed in the Centro relates to the display of contact information. Suppose you click on a contact entry for which you entered a fair amount of information. That is, more than can be displayed on one screen (Given the inefficient way information is now displayed, that is not hard). On the 680 you will not find any cursor or arrows to let you move up or down the page to see additional information. But there actually is one that is invisible in the bottom right of the screen. On the Centro, it is visible. But did Palm fix this bug in the 680? No. Owners of that model are stuck. This is expected given the general contempt Palm shows toward its customers. You will also find stupid changes in the Calendar. For example, you could on a Palm PDA hit an entry for 9am on a particular day and it would let you start an appointment with 9 am as the default entry for start time. That is, while you were viewing other appointments you could select an open time for a new appointment. Now it doesn't enter that default (on the next screen). In my view, Palm has messed things up enough you might as well use some other OS. Like what Blackberry offers, although overall their PDA/PIM seems less efficient. Oh, and customer support says this new PDA platform is exactly what Palm intended for the PDA smartphone, even though they know it is different from their PDA's. So which do they think is better? If they think so highly of the implementation on the Smartphone, why don't they change their PDA's? Palm won't say, but I think we can guess. Palm's right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing, and anyone with good judgement has long since left the Palm development group.",neutral
"I received this for Christmas (I'm notorious for getting lost) and was so excited. Since then I've taken a couple of fairly long trips using it. She (SuzieQ) gets me where I'm going but seems to take the long way. It's a straight shot down I-70 to get to St. Louis from Kansas but . . . I was advised to go through downtown KC among other things. A trip to Atchison, KS took me through some very rural areas that could easily have been avoided. I started out following the directions to see how well she worked but was ready to pull my hair out before I got back to any place I recognized. Some of the time SuzieQ says ""Turn Right,"" or ""Keep Right"" meaning the same thing. Somewhat confusing.

"The ear piece is comfortable and the battery life a respectable 5-6 hours, but two issues have made it a second choice that came with the wired ear phone that came with my treo 700. First problem is the bluetooth connectivity is spotty. Many times when a call comes in, pressing the ear piece button does not pick it up, and then annoyingly 2-3 minutes into the conversation, the set kicks in and takes the signal from the handset. The second problem is the hinge that keeps the microphone boom in place. It's loose, and won't stay where I put it. The sound hasn't been affected noticably, but I don't like a limp boom.",neutral

"Purchased new in 2005, this headset worked fairly well for 11 months. After a factory software upgrade, the blue-tooth signal began to degrade. After a couple of weeks, the signal was so poor the headset had to be returned under warranty. The warranty turn-around time was 2 weeks. Jabra replaced the headset with a new one in March of 2006. The new headset seemed to lose the blue tooth signal every 10 or 15 calls, even with the cellphone right next to the headset. In July the display stopped working. I asked Jabra to replace the headset under warranty because I received the replacement only 4 months prior. They refused. 1 Week later, the headset stopped working completely. I would not recommend this product (or this company) based on their product line and service.",negative

"I purchased this phone as a upgrade when I had been with the world's best wireless provider (T-Mobile) for a year (YAY ME!). Initially I was so in love with the phone itself since the phone I had before it was a dinosaur to me- the Samsung R225. A few weeks after I purchased it, the initial infactuation wore off and it was a regular, old, fat phone which is actually one of the first things people delight in telling me when they see it! ""WOW! What a HUGE phone!"" ""I've never seen a phone that big!"" ""It looks like a remote!"". While I do hate attention it brings, I sometimes secretly enjoy the perks of this phone-like the camera (both reg. and video), high-quality color screen, the real one player, as well as its uniqueness (is that a word?). There are a lot of cool tricked out things to do with the phone as well, as far as faceplates, flashing what-nots, etc. but who would want to bring attention to this phone. I am currently showcasing this ""UCO- Unidentified Cellular Object"" in a delightful magenta faceplate that allows it to play nice and fit in well with the other phones on the playground. A word to the wise: Don't get sucked in by it's witty features and convinience- be prepared to deal with the unending taunts, compliments, questions, and awkward stares of those who want to know more but are afraid that your monster of a phone will bite their head off mid-sentence! For those of you who choose to purchase this delightful piece of machinery-make sure you make your decision to return it within the 14 day trial period!",neutral
"This phone arrived and I fully charged the battery, this only gave me one day worth of battery life. I tried again with the same results, one day or less of battery life and sometimes the phone just shuts down when the battery is near the end. This MAY be because the phone has been in stock super long and the battery is ancient, (date stamped from 2009 or so) OR it could be that it is not a genuine Motorola product. Also the phone is more plasticky than I am used too with prior Motorola Razors. (Prior models maybe?) But this also makes me wonder if this is a legit Motorola product or some knock off. Adding to this impression is the fact that some of the little plastic/rubber screw covers came off within a day or two of purchase and the limited documentation that arrived with the phone. All of this adds up to a phone I cannot use and cannot return because I threw away the packaging. I am not at all happy with this product.",negative

"The difference between a good cell phone and a great one is in the small details, which this phone misses. On the positive side, it has almost all of the features I want: 1. Big 2.2"" color screen with SVGA quality 2. Bluetooth for wireless earpiece/microphone. 3. Built in speakerphone 4. Voice activated dialing with bluetooth 5. 640 X 480 camera with 4X digital zoom 6. AIM Instant Messaging 7. Plays JAVA games 8. Internet and instant messaging 9. Large 5 MB memory capacity which can store lots of pictures, video and games. 10. You can purchase a cable and software to u/l and d/l pictures, ringtones, etc. directly from your computer. With a little hunting on-line, you can also get software to really mess with the phone! 11. Most thematic elements can be changed including Polyphonic ringers, wallpaper, screensavers, etc. So, what is wrong? 1. The phone book is misorganized: Almost every person I want in my phone book has a home phone number, a cell phone and a business phone. I want a phone book that has one entry for each name, and then a subdirectory for each of the different phone numbers and e-mail addresses. 2. The 5 way navigation key with center button is hard to use as it is too small, and the button in the center is hard to push, particularly if you have large fingers. 3. The ""call"" and ""hang-up"" keys are not properly backlit so that it is almost impossible to see them at night, even in a nearly pitch black room. (Why is the camera button well lit when you have no need for a camera in the dark?) 4. The hands-free voice dialing requires such precision in the timing of saying the name, and you have to say the name loud, and in a quiet environment, or it won't work. This virtually requires you to look at the phone when saying the name, which defeats the purpose of ""hands-free."" A person can look pretty stupid yelling out someone's name over and over again in the middle of the shopping mall. 5. The phone is a bit on the heavy side, at 4.3 ounces, although not horribly so. (For example, the Motorola Razr and Sanyo SCP8200 weigh in at about an ounce less.) 6. The front screen is the typical little motorola blue/gray clock display instead of a proper color screen. 7. The built in speakerphone is not loud enough, particularly when using the Motorola/Cingular leather phone ""glove"" as it covers the speaker. In summary, it is a good phone which, if Motorola had invested a bit more creativity and care in developing, could have been a great phone at the same price. Again, it is the details which are wrong.",neutral

I did't need all the frills of the expensive phones (texting, camera, web access) and didn't want to pay over $40 per month for a phone like most people do, so this phone was perfect. I got the double minutes for life card and that is definately worth it. So it only costs 10 cents per minute. I don't have a problem adding time to it, I can buy time over the internet easily. The reception is pretty good, sometimes I get some static, but mostly not. I love the sleek look of this phone - it doesn't look like a ""pre-paid"" phone. The only thing I wish it had was a display on the outside - you have to open it up to see who's calling. But otherwise, great phone for a great price.",positive
People I call complain about background noises and hearing echos of their own voice. I end up either taking the headset off or turning it off to improve call quality and to not annoy the person I am calling. I'm not sure what the noise shield mentioned in the name of the unit is really suppose to do but my last earpiece was much clearer and I had less complaints from the people I was talking to. I'm not satisfied with this item.,negative
"It's important to note the difference between the phone that you have and the service you get. Both are important when it comes to thinking about your purchase. The Motorola RAZR phone was very hot just a few years ago, and has now fallen out of the spotlight to the chocolater, pearl, and upcoming Apple iPhone. In particular, the web/email features are quite lacking. That said, the v3 phone itself is a reliable and good device, that is super slim and perfect to be used when you need something small and handy. I have a blackberry as well, and use my RAZR whenever I head out for dinner and need a phone that I can slip into my pocket or jacket. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about Cingular. In many places, particularly Northern and Southern California, Cingular has spotty coverage which causes you to drop your calls. Furthermore, customer service is polite but is most unhelpful, particularly compared to other service providers. I have spoken to many Cingular customer service reps and supervisors (an issue in itself), and while all have been very polite, they have never actually delivered on any of my requests. The Cingular coverage and service makes your RAZR phone unuseable, so much so that I was willing to pay the early termination fee to switch to a different provider. Bottom line, the RAZR is a fun and useful phone, just look to get it through a different service provider.",neutral
"I like the fact that you can just close and open the boom to turn the headset on and off. The headset can stay on standby for over a week without recharging. The headset itself is clumsy though. The clip doesn't fit very well over your ear and it fell off my ear quite a couple of times when I'm checking my blindspots while driving. The speaker on the headset is also very low compared to the Plantronics Voyager 510 that I bought for my wife at the same time. I guess it wouldn't be a problem if the headset fits you. The noise reduction is also very good on the headset. So, I would suggest going to the store and try this on before buying it. If the clip works on your ear, it's a great product for you. Otherwise, you'll be struggling from time to time keeping this headset on your head and trying to listen to your caller.",neutral
the reception isn't as good as my old w385 but other than that it's a good phone. can't beat the nice purple color. all I needed was a phone that made and recieved calls.

I've had this for at least 6 months now and I use it every day but I did not realize it was an outdated model when I bought it. Windows 8 will not recognize the phone or the software on the CD so none of the software or Outlook sync functions work. The phone discharges very fast and if you have the phone on charger and try to use the headset you better not go much beyond the room the phone is in or everything turns to static. I'll probably look at buying a cordless phone system that comes with two handsets and a headset. I doubt it will be a Plantronics brand. I used Plantronics cordless headsets and phones for years at work and always like them but using this one at home has been a real disappointment.,neutral

"I love the Otterbox holster for the protection it provides my phone. However, the spring will wear out after nine months or so of use. I had to take the spring out and adjust it so it would work. But it only lasted for a few weeks before the clip was loose again. This model (for the Black Berry Curve 8330) has the ability to swivel (which apparently all of their holsters do, I am told). Again, after nine months or so of use the holster will swivel much too easily. I don't like the ability of the holster to swivel so I fixed that with some screws. I used a screw to fix the clip as well. Customer service from Otter Box is certainly lacking. I contacted them with the following message: Hi. I purchased my Otter Box Defender on May 24, 2009 from Amazon.com LLC. Recently, the belt clip that rotates on the holster is so loose that it rotates on my belt too easily. The spring on the clip itself is so weak that I have had my phone drop off of my belt and land on the floor. Is there any way to replace the rotating belt clip? I love my Otter Box and the protection it gives my phone. I don't want to give it up for something with less protection but has better components. Thank you. The following was the only response received: Update for Case #93443 - ""Holster clip"" If you send me your name address and phone type that we are carrying. Thanks, [name of customer service rep] I don't know what they were going to do to resolve this. I thought that by asking for my name and address they would have sent me another holster. I never heard from them after that. It was (and is) within the one year warranty period. Get the Otterbox if you want the protection it provides but be prepared to make some fixes yourself. Don't get it for the lack of customer service or the components that will eventually fail.",neutral
"As with most places, the cellphone laws are beginning to be implemented, not just in the United States, but in other Countries as well. Blueant did a pretty good job with the Supertooth 3, despite its shortcomings... Firstly, it is a good looking system... gloss piano black with simple buttons and a magnetic clip for your car's visor. The size is comparable to the original iphone when it first came out but not the same weight of course. The multi language setup is a plus (recommend the british language as it is best sounding) and pairing with a Sony Ericsson test phone was pretty fast... uploading the contact list from the phone in less than 3 minutes. On a call it would say the person's name or is it's not in your list, the full number. Speaker quality is good although it tends to be drowned out by cars with heavy exhausts and the windows down. You also have the option of voice answering or manually pressing the buttons... Now in that light there are some bad news... some people carry more than one phone for use and while Blueant states that it can be paird with up to 8 phones, you can only use one at a time... so if you use 2 phones, this one isn't for you. There were issues to pair Nokia phones with the symbian software. The 6120 classic which we tested would not allow the contacts to auto upload to the supertooth 3 and we had to manually do so. Also we found that incoming calls from the Nokia were not listed on the Supertooth's system and you had to manually press the phone's button instead of the speakerphone to answer. Dual sim phones also had a slight problem as well. Call Quality was up and down, but more good than bad. People sometimes said you would ""echo"" as if you had an earpiece headset and again depenting on the road noise and the drone of heavy exhausts, the mic may get drowned out. Windows up though it was quite sufficient and to a point even clearer than the newer S4 that supports multipont. The buttons also were a little hard to press while driving and you had to hold it a while to shut it off. But don't let these things deter you from buying this speakerphone. It is a good system if you have one phone and unless we were doing something wrong to pair them, we recommend not using this with nokia symbian software phones. Also if you have a sports car or any vehicle that is loud bear in mind that your noise may drown out your quality. Overall good product for the price.",neutral

I only rated this charger two stars because it takes so long for this second battery to charge. I have two external chargers that I plugged my spare batteries into and my captivate battery charged much faster then my infuse battery (they both were completely new & needing a full charge). So it works however its taking 7hrs or more to fully charge my spare batteries. Ok its been only 4 days now and this charger does not work. It blinks like its charging but when the extra battery is place in the phone it has not charged at all. This is disappointing dropping to 1 star no star if it was possible!,negative
"Others have noted quite a bit, and as such there are featuers I haven't bothered to pay for, but as to the things I have used the phone for, I would say it's ok for a free phone, but not worth paying for. As to the primary functionality, I haven't had problems with calls at all. Navigation is pretty simple. It's sturdy and I like the button for opening it. If you just want a phone to work as a phone, this one isn't too bad. The camera on this phone is essentially useless. The quality is so bad that you're likely not to bother using it. I tried using it for fun for a while, but found that nothing came out well so just stopped. I loved having the radio on the phone for my walk to the subway. I could catch up on some news. But then the phone stopped recognizing that the ear piece was plugged in. I got a replacement phone, but the same thing happened to the replacement after a month or so. To have a picture ID a person, you need to have the person's info locally on the phone, not on the card. Phone numbers when added are defaulted locally, which was a problem when I switched phones and had to move all my contacts to the card. While this seems to be typical, games are pointless. You can play for a few minutes / levels, then you have to pay. I don't understand why a couple simple games can't be included.",negative

"I saw all the ratings saying that it did not catch all the disks as well as the permanent ones in their home courses. I agreed that I wanted to save the money and since it would only be for practice I did not think I would care. But after I got it in my backyard it sure bugged me more than I expected. I was surprised (or frustrated) just how many ""good shoots"" fell out the back or sides of the chains. So I spent $27 on extra chain and s hooks. Maybe someone has a better and/or cheaper way to upgrade the chains but my new configuation performs well. I do not think it matters how the extra chains go on the basket as I tried it two ways. The extra weight seems to stop most disks that use to pass through the stock chain system. Also the height of the basket is lower than the average permanent ones on the course I play, so, it is hard to get a feel for just how far a miss will travel past the basket that was correct height (I do not know the correct height of a basket but it is about 6 inches low of the average at my home course). Although lots of different shots on the course help go into your decision to ""go for it"" when putting. Like up hill or down hill shots. Just another example of where the basket as is is not giving proper feedback as all the shots into a low basket hit the ground soon after a miss simular to an uphill shot or putt. I hope that all complaining is helpful because I want to add that the ease of assembly, structure, weight all seem good or as expected. I love having a basket in my backyard. I have been using it everyday. It's nice to just grab my six putters for a minute or two on the way in our out of the house. Sometimes I spend more time with different lengths. Lots of practice for me. My putting is getting better quickly!!! And I can play some putting games with friends from time to time.",neutral

Also, as someone else mentioned, you have to 'unlock' it if you wish to use it without sliding it open. Now, that's good for avoiding accidental button-pressing, but it should be user-configurable. Lastly, there is a limited number of menu items that can be assigned to the 4 user-defined keys. I wanted to assign one of the keys to To-Do application, but was unable to do so.

This was not the case this time. I planned ahead, brought my external battery with me and charged my phone while at the park enjoying the festival. Thanks. The external battery is small enough for a man to keep it in his pocket, and of course small enough for a woman to carry it in her purse. I'm not much of an electronic geek, but this is a must have for anyone that has an electronic device that runs on a battery. I love it and it goes with me just like my car keys and wallet do. I also like how the external battery stays cool, and my iphone stayed cool as it charged. Two thumbs up. Looking forward to rating it a five after more use of the product.",positive

"Pros: 1. Very small and lightweight. Rubber earpiece is very comfortable, you may forget you are wearing it. 2. Stylish and attractive. 3. Calls USUALLY are clear and crisp. Other party seems to hear me fine as well. 4. Voice Isolation feature works incredibly well. 5. Company stands behind products with frequent upgrades with USB 6. Quality built and feel when pressing the buttons. Con: 1. Rubber earpiece starts to degrade after a few months from oils/sweat and heat from your ear. 2. Updating to latest version is a bit confusing which may turn away some buyers. 3. Turning on and off Voice Isolation is the button as hanging up/picking up phone calls, which can be tricky to control. 4. Seems to lose connection to my phone quite often. (T-Mobile Shadow, Nokia 6133, Samsung U600 and D900.) Well basically I used this for about a few months. In the first couple months the headset worked great. My callers heard me clear and crisp. The voice isolation feature worked as stated. But everything went downhill after that. First my rubber ear piece started to deform which caused the headset to not fit properly in my ear. I do not use the hook as it interferes with my glasses. Calls I made and received started to lose reception. Clear and crispness was no longer there. I updated the software hoping it would help but that seem to screw up the button features. It started not pick up calls when I pressed the main button and instead would activate or deactivate the Voice isolation feature. It would disconnect with my phone and I would have to reset it by turning it off. A couple of times it totally lost pairing with my phone where I then had to pair it up again.

This is a great product. I bought in March 2017. It's works great. I did have one issue in November. I notified power bear and they responded back almost immediately. They took care of the issue just as fast. Awesome customer service. Would definitely buy from them again and would highly recommend.,positive
"I've purchased two of these phones but I didn't get a chance to use the phone I purchased from Amazon. My phone arrived fairly quickly but when I opened the box it was immediately obvious that the phone manufacturer's box that's inside the Amazon.com box had been opened. When I opened the manufacurer's box all of the packing material was missing and the box contained only loose phone parts (phone body, back cover, battery, AC adapter) that had apparently been bouncing around alot. The phone was badly damaged, the front of the phone was a spider web of cracks and it appeared that the camera lens may have been cracked as well. I sent it back the next day and Amazon gave me a prompt credit for my return in about a week. After receiving my credit from Amazon I went to ebay and bought this phone for about $30 more and it arrived brand new and in perfect condition. It also came with many accessories, including software CD, data cable, stereo headset, holster, car charger and 1GB memory chip. I installed my SIM card and the memory chip and the phone works like a champ. I loaded the phone tools software on my HP laptop and it immediately updated to the latest version. I just use the synchronization for my Outlook contacts and calender and it has worked well with only one minor issue. For some reason the software was synchronizing with the calendar information in my archive folder. Once I changed the synchronization setting to go to my current calendar folder there have been no issues. So far I've only downloaded a few ringtones from the internet and they have downloaded quickly and flawlessly. This is my first Motorola phone (I'm a former Nokia owner) and I have found this phone easy to use. The sound quality is very clear, definitely better than any of the Nokia phones I've had, and the signal strength and reception seem to be better as well. I've had no problems with accidental pushing of the buttons on the exterior of the phone. The phone construction is very solid, nothing cheesy here. I have the black model and the finish is excellent and after a week of use remains without a scratch. I'm very happy with this phone and would recommend it to others although I would purchase it elswhere since Amazon's supplier seems to to be getting a reputation for poor packaging and damage during shipment.",positive

The motion sensor works well - it wakes up when I get in the car and goes to sleep when I'm >50 feet away. Overall, I'd say it's an okay solution to hands free calling but it's not ideal. Some people complained in their reviews about the size but I think the size is just fine - it sit nicely on my Subaru's visor and takes up about 2/3s of the space there, completely out of my way when it's not in use.",neutral

"Be warned, this item is actually being sold by Tiger Direct. Mine looked like a refurbished unit and it was branded T-Mobile. The status on the order showed it was shipped on December 30th, but the tracking number (eventually) showed it was not really shipped until January 6th. When you put this item in your shopping cart, Amazon will probably recommend that you also purchase a CD with Motorola phone tools and a USB cable. I took their recommendation but that didn't work out very well for me. One of the selections on the phone tools software is labeled 'Update phone software'. That sounds like a good idea and harmless enough doesn't it? Unfortunately, if you select that item, your phone software will be updated to the latest version, but your phone will now be relocked and won't work until you enter a 'Subsidy code'. Tiger Direct phone support (9 - 5 PST Mon - Fri) is a good way to waste 20-30 minutes on hold (my average hold time). Eventually, they told me to email the IMEI number from the phone. After emailing TD the IMEI number and a few days waiting, they informed me they were not able to give me the code and I would have to return the phone (at my expense) for a replacement. Luckily, the Amazon guarantee allowed me to return it for a refund instead. I still have to pay the return shipping but at this point, I'm happy to be able to do that. Bottom line: this is a refurbished phone and though unlocked from T-Mobile, not exactly reliably unlocked.",negative

"Motorola has made some really good BT headphones & headsets but build quality is spotty on some of thier offerings. Thus, reliability and durability are sometimes questionable. Some of thier products are really good and others were not thoughtfully designed with longevity in mind. The H710 has very good build quality and it remains to be seen how long it will last. The H700 was another good looking headset but it lasted less than a year in moderate use. The battery died too soon. I have a HS820 that is atleast 3 years old and it does not know the meaning of the word ""die"". I had a H680 commit suicide after a couple of months. Motorola just doesn't make them like they used to but I decided to give them one last chance. Your mileage will vary....Buyer beware.",positive

It's really painly to use, because keys are very tiny and it's very easy to press what you don't want, besides that, even when I was using anti-scratch films on the screen, it always was dirty because when you use the phone against your head to speak it gets dirty with marks of your ear. But as this wasn't completely painfull, the phone got locked once a week at least, sometimes I tried to make a call and it just didn't dialed until you turned it off and on again, like a soft reset, sometimes I was using an application and it just turned off and on again without hesitate or asking, I really NOT recommend buying this equipment nor Amazon or any other online or physical store.",negative

These are one piece and the shell is made of ""squishy"" plastic (similar to jelly-plastic).

"I originally bought this headset for my wife (her first BT headset) because she didn't like the look of my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Plantronics-Voyager-510-Bluetooth-Headset-with-Multipoint-Technology-Retail-Packaged/dp/B0009B0IX4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset with Multipoint Technology [Retail Packaged</a>]. She found the 330 painfully uncomfortable and decided to sacrifice style for comfort (quite a departure from her typical choices, particularly regarding footwear); thus she is now enjoying my 510 and I'm getting by with the 330. I don't find the 330 uncomfortable for the first few hours, but I never forget it's in my ear like I did with the 510. If you have very small ears, it's probably a bad choice. Here's a brief comparison between the two with my 5 point ratings: STYLE & DESIGN I greatly prefer the 330's single side button that makes it very easy adjust the volume. On the 510, I found the volume and power buttons behind the ear difficult to reach and easy to confuse - probably my biggest complaint with the 510. I prefer the look and size of the 330. It's more modern and discreet. However, it's not a fashion accessory and everyone looks like a dork with a flashing blue light next to their ear with any BT headset. I wish people would realize this and take these things off in public (especially in restaurants). I only use mine in the car or when at the computer so this is the least important criteria for me. COMFORT The 510 is the clear winner here for both me and my wife. Everyone's ear is different and I find the 330 less uncomfortable than my wife did. A few may find the 330 fits them better than the 510, but the 510 includes 3 ear pieces to provide a custom fit. PERFORMANCE This is the best reason to get the 510. I've used worse headsets than the 330, but none better than the 510. With the 330, I get static if the phone is on the other side of body from the headset. The 330's claimed 30' range - maybe at high altitude with no obstructions, no other radio interference with no solar flares and a full moon - real world, more like 10' with no obstructions. Noise canceling is far superior on the 510. People would never guess I was using a headset - usually they couldn't even tell when I was in my car. The 330 is about useless in a windy environment and picks up a lot of background noise. Both headsets seem to have very good battery life and audio quality for listening. The 510 also has the advantage of being able to pair with 2 devices simultaneously but I've never tried this feature. STYLE & DESIGN 330 - 4 510 - 2 COMFORT 330 - 3 510 - 5 PERFORMANCE 330 - 3 510 - 5 FEATURES & PRICE 330 - 4 (probably better than most headsets < $30) 510 - 5 (more expensive but worth it for features and performance) OVERALL 330 - 3 510 - 5 The comfort and performance of the 510 justify the extra $16.",neutral

"I bought this product a year ago based on its recently released Mac software and good hardware reviews. At that time Snow Leopard was announced. Plantronics has not upgraded the software once since it was released (and it was poor in the first place) and now it doesn't support Mac's latest OS. Customer support doesn't answer questions and apart from an initial ""we are working on it"" they are now saying they won't support 10.6. I understand this policy for ""out of production"" products or perhaps for older products and major OS changes BUT in this case it was predictable and I can not but help feel they knowingly duped their customers. I like the hardware but as long as this is how Plantronics treats its customers I am not buying another of their products.",negative

I thought I had everything put back together and it turned on but wouldn't work after that and it wouldn't stay together - had to tape it to see if it would work. No go - Bummer!

"I agree with most of what's been written already here and I'd like to add my 2 cents as I have owned the n95-8GB too and I can tell you categorically, the N82 is a much better phone. Despite of the fact that it doesn't have 3G, I've decided to buy it and the reason is that I don't really need the 3G most of the times. Since it has Wi-Fi I can compensate for extensive downloads and applications. Using the EDGE is of course 'painful' compared to 3G and the only downside is that download and voice calls can't go through simultaneously. No biggy. N95 had a lot of bugs and very annoying lags in the camera when shooting (see my n95 review). Worst was a few seconds (literally) from the moment the shutter was pressed to the moment the picture was taken, processed and have the camera ready for the next one. An absolute no go... Slider is so flimsy on the N95 that I was really afraid the screen part is going to crack and dislocate. The N82's camera is a great improvement on that part. It has a Xenon flash and a much faster response time. I personally prefer the lens slide as a camera activator because it prevents accidental camera mode when in the holster, something I have experienced with the N95 quite a lot. Very useful function (especially for travelers): The modem function works great either via the USB modem driver or the Bluetooth, with download speeds that could put some so-called `broadband' speeds to shame. This is great in places where you have no Wi-Fi or free Wi-Fi for your laptop (like in Airport terminals, etc). The phone also syncs with the PC (outlook) using the same connections (through the USB or via Bluetooth) MicroSD: The N82's spec doesn't state support for HC MicroSD memory, but I took the chance and bought an 8GB one and it works flawlessly... Screen: Auto rotation is somewhat annoying but it can be disabled. Media player: Sometimes it freezes with other applications running to the point when it freezes and restarts the phone. It happens rarely but it does (with the latest FW version). Sound quality is reasonable although on my phone I hear clicks and pops on the over tones which is weird because I only transferred the songs as MP3 without additional compression to MP4 which is available through the Media Manager. A-GPS: Well this is a debatable function and whether useful or not it is up to how much really one needs a GPS. I find it to be a nice toy to have but I don't consider it as a serious GPS. In fact the Nokia maps are not so great for this service. The Voice guidance is free for only 3-days after which the navigation is disabled and when used, it redirects to purchase options which are so ridiculously expensive. I downloaded Google maps for the phone which work much better overall. Battery life: Much better than the N95, though it is not even close to what's in the spec. I don't know why Nokia doesn't think about that. The battery should be at least 1300mAh to give a decent battery life between charges. Overall it's a good phone for the price I paid (I don't see why one would pay more than a $150) for the black one as priced on Amazon, or even more for the N95 which doesn't give you more for the money.",positive

"I read all the reviews before I bought this (about a month ago), and after seeing how many people had problem with the earpieces that are included, I went ahead and bought the Jabra Eargels at the same time. As luck would have it, one of the hard little earpieces that came with the Jawbone fits my ear perfectly, so I wasted $10 on the Eargels. Oh well. The little rubbery strip that covers the charging connection has fallen off somewhere, and was probably eaten by my cat. That's okay, I didn't really need it anyway. I find the Jawbone extremely comfortable, and can wear it all day without it bothering me. I was actually surprised by how well I can hear other people, even with background noise, and no one appears to have any difficulty hearing me, even when there is background noise on my end. All in all, I would buy this product again, and I would recommend it to my family. That's about as good as you can get, right?",positive

"The defender case for your iPhone 3G is quite possibly the best case on the market. In this review I will address issues brought to light by other reviewers as well as detailing why it is I believe the Defender by Otterbox is the only logical solution on the market. The case is in three pieces which makes the overall phone larger than most phones on the market. The iPhone also happens to be one of the most expensive phones on the market - if you believe there may be a potential accident in which you drop your investment, then protection is what is key. The bulk directly translates to superior protection. While not completely waterproof, the case does protect against rain and moisture - I just wouldn't go swimming with it. A previous review mentions that the phone will fall out of the belt clip, claiming that you may not be able to hear the phone if it were to fall. Either that customer had a fluke of a clip or they weren't placing it into the clip properly (which is my bet). The clip connects the phone in no fewer than four locations, providing ample connectivity for active people. I work in the film industry, climbing ladders, running around, constructing sets, and cutting lumber - the phone has not fallen from the holster once. The issue with docking is a valid concern, but considering there are many other ways to charge your phone (via the included USB adapter to connect either to your computer or using a wall socket) I feel this argument is trivial, close-minded and moot. The only people I would not recommend the Otterbox Defender 3G case are those individuals who have owned and operated an iPhone for a considerable amount of time prior to purchasing the case. The case does add considerable mass the your phone, and as such, if you've already adapted to using your phone in its slimmer profile, you may get annoyed at the added girth. If, however, you have just recently purchased an iPhone, or are planning on buying one soon - do not hesitate your purchase. The Otterbox Defender is the only case of the market that fulfills the purpose of a phone case: protection.",positive

"I have four of these now. I primarily use them to watch TV. I use the Miccus transmitter and they work well together. Pros Has long range when used with the Miscus Bluetooth transmitter. The sound rarely breaks up. Occasionally if I am near the running microwave or far away from the transmitter it will have a little breakup. Cons It can be difficult to switch between different Bluetooth transmitting devices so I have decided I need a separate head set for each device. Sometimes the headset connect to something I don't want it too and it is difficult to figure out what that is and force it to disconnect from that device. The little led light is off when it is connected so it is hard to tell if it is on. (Pressing the volume buttons will make it beep). One of my headsets has stopped working in one of the ears.

"This is second unit i've owned (lost first). Impressed by battery life, but sound volume is inadequate unless surroundings are quiet. Will replace if I can learn about a unit with more volume. Sync with BlackBerry is simple but can sometimes take multiple tries. Syncs reliably once you wait 20 or so seconds, and found sync usually fails if attempted too quickly. Frustrating. Find another product. Update II: Now replaced with Aliph Jawbone Noise Shield Bluetooth Headset, and see my other review",neutral

"before I purchased this I asked if it would work with my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 N7000 but I never got an answer so I went ahead and ordered it. It does not fit correctly. The volume keys are blocked, the flash for the camera is blocked. I really Like the color and how it's made just very disappointed that it does not fit correctly.",neutral
"I had the same problem as someone else (sent a few pictures, then it broke... sending a picture causes white screen and a ""reboot""). Tech help thinks it might be because we had an old 32K SIM card. Enabled bluetooth and in the process it starts asking for passcodes, etc. Tried to change the default from 12345 to my zip code. Bottome line, by the time I was done with the stupid menus, and seen enough CODE ERROR messages, it locked me out and DESTROYED my SIM card. Had to get a new one and rebuild ALL my data. Not happy. Moving from a Motorola to a Samsung was pretty easy, functionality and keypad-wise. Moving to a Nokia is WEIRD. Don't like the layout at ALL. Now to the good stuff. The camera component is probably the best camera on any cell phone I've used or seen to date. Not as soft or blurry as our Samsung. Very bright and clear displays, inside and out--very high resolution. Has a very capable night vision mode (could be what hosed up the picture send capability after a few days, who knows?) Based on the problems I had, similar to others, I'd rate it 2 stars. But if that was a SIM problem and the replacement works fine, I'd give it 4 stars because of the quality of the camera. So it gets 3.",neutral
"Overall great product. Cons: Although it can pair with up to 8 phones, it can only pair with one phone at a time. So if me and my wife get in to her car, it always pairs with her and I have to go through a painful power-off,power-on,hold-button-for-x-seconds sequence. I don't understand why they can't pair it to both. I can understand only one can accept calls at any given time. May be they need two transmitters, but that is what I was really looking for. Automatic sync of address book is nice. Automatic sync of ring-tone (and use the same ring tone on the bluetooth set) is very cool. Nice to have features (In case they ever look at this) 1. The on/off isn't a simple switch to slide. Holding a button down for ""several seconds"" is irritating. That said, none of the other ones I have seen have this feature either. The battery life is good, so I just leave it on. People who park their car in garage (closer to the house I meant) will find that the device keeps paired to the phone even when the phone is inside the house. Having a simple on/off switch would have made it easier to work with this situation. 2. If this had an audio-out, it would have been perfect for vehicles that have audio/line-in in the music system. Why not use the Car speakers if you can? Units that use FM to do the same are useless IMO.",positive

"The cable works fine to just charge my Evo from my computer, but it doesn't allow me to sync my music, etc. which is the main reason I purchased it in the first place. DON'T BUY THIS IF YOU WANT TO SYNC YOUR EVO. If you just want to charge your phone, then you'll be fine.",negative

"Revision of my initial review. The vendor ""idealpoint"" is actually part of Trent. They provide excellent customer service. +1.510.651.2885 I spoke with Vivien. She resolved all my issues quickly and with a smile. :) The Trent charger itself works perfectly. When you receive it, make sure you fully charge the unit before use. It may show fully charged but charge it anyway. This is my second Trent charger. The IMP500 is about the size and weight of my wallet - this size is perfect for me. I have never drained the old Trent charger while charging my iPhone. It fits easily into a jacket pocket so you can charge and talk while moving around. You can recharge the battery off a wall charger or USB plug. The larger (in capacity, size, and weight) IMP1000 is worth considering for the iPad, but unnecessary for the iPhone, IMO. Caveats: As the ""Technical Details"" state, the current Trent packaging does NOT include an adapter for the iPhone. (This is due to Apple licensing restrictions.) You must use your own cable or find an adapter that will plug into the Trent supplied retractable cable. Two adapters, a micro and mini USB, are supplied. [Hint: If you are nice, Vivien may be able to give (not sell) you an original iPhone adapter that fits on the retractable cable.] I was hoping otherwise, but idealpoint tells me that this Trent charger will only charge 5V devices, not 15-24V computers, etc. so don't try. :( The IMP500 packaging is a little confusing because it hasn't been updated. The back of the box bar-code says the version shipped (x00016bjtp) is only for the (curve, bold, tour, storm). The side of the box says it is for iPads, iPhones, and iPods. But if the box includes only the two USB adapters, then you have the latest version.",positive

"After two major dissapointments with Seidio's ""skin and holster"" product not fitting my 8330 correctly, I decided to try Otterbox for the first time. THEY GOT IT RIGHT! Otterbox calls this unit ""Semi-Rugged"". They are too modest!!! The aptly named Defender not only fit my BB like a well-worn glove, it offers protection elements that Seidio ignores. Every part of the device is covered and protected with the exception of the trackball and microphone. I wouldn't have it any other way. Even the keyboard is protected by a very accurately formed clear cover. Pros - Superior fit and protection. Lightweight and stylish. Sleeper feature is a must for a BB to maintain life of the battery. Adds a little bulk to the device, but the protection factors are well worth it! Cons - Vibration feature of the BB is dampened severely. A little pricey, but compared to the damage I've done to past BB devices, the investment will no doubt extend the life of the unit and save me money in the long run. Bottom line - I'd do it again in a heartbeat! All things considered, this is the best buy out there. Don't like the yellow? Get the all black version instead. Reason for 4 stars is due the impact on the vibration feature. That will take some getting used to.",positive

"Someone else said it previously, ""Fit is Crucial"" I could not agree more. I am using the medium sized ear bud with the XL leather ear hoop and have bent the ear loop to pressure lightly against my head so that the voice sensor is pushed against my cheek. I have spoken to people with the water running or even the vacuum cleaner running and the person I was speaking to could hear nothing but my voice. AWESOME! The headset is very light and very comfy once fitted correctly. I wear glasses (big thick geeky things) and it the ear loops are still comfy. It even looks good. It's worth the cash! UPDATE: Customer service is very good. I had some problems with static on my earpiece (people I was talking to couldn't hear it-only I could) and had to return my Jawbone 2 under warranty. I emailed support, they quickly gave me return instructions. Just after receiving my faulty headset, they shipped out a brand new replacement. No questions asked. Very prompt, very polite.",positive

They said that we could send the units back and they would send us new ones. What are the chances of all 8 devices being defective?

"I am very disappointed in this case. Having previously owned Body Glove products and accessories for my phones, I automatically purchased this case for my Voyager. After 2 weeks, the rubber coating on the front part of the snap on case started to peel off, then a week later, the coating on the back half started to peel off as well. Not only that, I noticed wear marks on the phone itself on the hinges where it comes into contact with the case when I open the phone. This is unacceptable as I believe a case is to protect a phone not damage it in the process. Another complaint is that if any dirt (I live in the mountains and take my phone with me while I horseback ride) gets underneath the front cover, it scratches the surface of the phone. And finally, the belt clip doesn't hold the phone very well, my phone has gone flying to the ground from 5 or 6 feet in the air while riding.

"This is the only one to buy. Trust me and save yourself some headaches. Unfortunately it's not perfect, this is my 3rd one. The clip has a tendency to break under pressure.

But you're still able to receive calls, texts and appointment reminders. This function saves your Blackberry's battery and prevents accidentally calls or errant appointment entries. After going through the tremendous annoyances with other holsters, this feature is ideal and makes this worth 10 times as much. Plus my 8830 World Edition fits perfectly in this case. It was only about $5 but with S&H it was $10. I bought my first replacement for $30 so this was a bargain for the exact same case. Like I said, I've had the clip break on me twice (I seam to get it caught in the arms of the couch) so you may want to buy 2 at a time. Trust me you'll regret any other choice. I did.",positive
"It works, and it's cheap. That's the good news... however the bad news is that the volume is pretty low when maxed (unless you sit right under your visor you'll be leaning forward to hear), there is no AC adapter, so charging can be a hassle unless you buy an additional AC to Cigarette Lighter adapter for charging.

"Was extremely dissappointed in the Jawbone. In short it's very poorly designed and doesn't provide the performance as advertised. It doesn't fall a little short...it's not even close to the mark of bluetooth headsets that I used several years ago. I'm a average sized man with average ears, facial structure etc. and could never get the Jawbone Headset to rest comfortably in my ear or have the earhook not create an unpleasant, uncomfortable feeling. I was always sure to have the contact point touching my face to be sure the noise cancelling worked correctly but people always told me I sounded like I was on a speaker phone and at times had real difficulty hearing me. I use this in business everyday and it conveyed a very unprofessional ""appearance"". I tried everything I could to get better performance but nothing worked. I used this for several months giving it every opportuniy to perform. The fit to the ear is a serious problem for a lot of people and a major disadvantage to this headset not to mention the poor sound quality. I replace it with the Plantronics Discovery 925 Bluetooth Earpiece(better price and the latest ""clear"" technology), which comes in BLACK, SILVER, GOLD, and PURPLE. The fit to the ear is extremely comfortable and secure, the receiving sound excellent and to the person I'm talking to they say it sounds like I'm on a land line. Never anymore complaints from peole I'm speaking to. From another reviewer's recommendation, I also purchased a windscreen that you can use to cover the end of the headset that's exposed to block any interference with wind noise. So if you know you're going to be outside at a ball game, riding a bicycle, etc., you can slip this on and have a headset that blocks virtually any wind noise making this the perfect unit. I bought two of the windscreens and keep one in my car and the other in my latop computer case so they are ready to use when needed. You can order directly from Etymotic Research, item # ER89-30 only $1.75 per set. [...] The Plantronics Discovery 925 Bluetooth Earpiece also comes with a charging case that not only safely stores your headset, but serves to recharge it if you were to run the headset battery down...very cool bonus feature for long trips...and long conversations when you can't charge your headset with the hard wire! Check out the reviews on the Plantronics Discovery 925 Bluetooth Earpiece and buy instead...you'll be glad you did. By the way, I've had 6 to 7 or more headsets and the Plantronis is the best that I've had so far.",negative

"I've used this armband for a few long bike rides now. It's not perfect though it's probably one of the few readily available products of its kind for the iPhone. Here's how the F8Z170-KG Sports Armband breaks down: PROS: - Nice fit for the iPhone and easy to get in place - Fairly water resistant, I got caught in light rain and it had no problem - Fits fairly tight for about 30 minutes - The touch screen works just fine through the cover, surprisingly - Has a professional, clean feel and appearance - Construction is on the high end side, with a metal (not plastic) buckle and quality screen cover CONS: - Very hard to get back out easily, though some would call this a ""feature"" for running - As a result, can't take easily pictures with it in place since the shot is usually gone after you extract the phone - Begins to slip down with extended use, often ends up in crook of elbow, after half an hour or so (fibers seem to get relaxed, tighten and wait 30 minutes, rinse, repeat) - Does not support reverse usage well (so you can read the screen by raising your arm a little) since the headphone plug can't be put in - Hard to wear with short sleeves since they ride up and then push down the armband It's not perfect but many will find it more than adequate for light duty use. Would probably buy again.",neutral

"The new world phone by (Mobal) must be fairly new. The budget phone is very small and hard to use. Very confusing on how to enter numbers, as well as navigating thru it.

The print is in very light blue which is very difficult to read due to the print.

"This Charger is awesome! First of all I wasn't expecting it until between 12/12 and 12/17, but it arrived on 12/11,So That was a plus for me! Second, I was kinda skeptical about purchasing it because it says that its for a Galaxy S and Blackberry so that can mean a lot of things! but I figured what the heck its cheap, so what can I loose! Well, I just got it today and decided to give it a try at work on my Galaxy S4, it charged from 80% to 100% in about 7 minutes!! Yes i timed it! and also the cord is long which is a plus for me! So if your looking for a fast charger with a long cord and not to mention a great price, this is the one!! update: not sure what the other reviewer meant by saying these are poor quality chargers, because I've had mine for a little over 2 weeks and it's still going strong!!

I have to credit both Microsoft and HP for doing a poor job, and T-mobile for selling it and not taking it back. I have a very long memory, and share my opinions. It's the worst device I own, maybe ever. Cost so much I can't bear to replace it, and not worth much on ebay, for good reason. If you want to pay extra for a PDA then chose this.

"I purchased the Garmin 200 after reading a lot of positive reviews on Amazon. It was a great product - simple design, easy to use. Unfortunately, it started to malfunction after 3 months. For example, it would just shut itself down even though it was plugged into a running car. Then the connection between the unit and the charger AND the charger and the car began to weaken. I say both because the red light that indicates the charger is plugged in doesn't always turn on, and if it's on, the unit doesn't always charge. I have another cigarette car charger that works just fine so I know the problem isn't my car. When I was able to get both connections going in my car, the unit would display that it was trying to read the connection to my computer. For something that is over $100 and was only used 3 times (once a month on average) for approximately 2 hours at a time, it should last more than 3 months. For those who are wondering, I didn't leave it in a freezing cold or oven-hot car and kept it in a drawer in my desk when it was not being used. When I contacted Garmin to get a replacement unit or charger within the warranty period, I was told that the unit had to be completely dead to qualify for a replacement. As most people know, electronic items often exhibit problems well before they fully die, if ever. If my unit starts to malfunction when I'm driving 65mph down the freeway, it's ""completely dead"" to me because I can't fuss with it and safely drive at the same time. Garmin's ""has to be dead"" policy is a pretty poor stall tactic to run out the warranty period. For that reason, I'm replacing my unit with another brand.",neutral
This cover really does feel like rubber though it is painted plastic. It fits well and securely and will not come off unless the phone is subjected to some pretty rough handling. I don't think it would offer much protection should the phone be dropped but it will protect it from scratches and other cosmetic damage. The phone will still look like new after the cover is removed. The phone is fully functional with the cover on and can be opened and closed without the cover getting in the way. It doesn't add a whole lot of bulk or weight to the phone and there is a hole on the back if you want to add a belt clip. This cover is inexpensive and effective protection for your phone.,positive
"I find this works good for the caller on the other end. My Mom is elderly and hearing impaired. She hears me better with jawbone. The noise cancellation elimates noise like inside a car. Also, I once had this noisy vacuum on and she heard me perfectly... no vacuum noise (that was amzaing). Jawbone does not cancel wind noise... wish they'd add that feature. Otherwise, the call quality that I experience is much better. Previously, I had a Motorola 820. The Motorola was more comfortable and the sound that I heard was slightly better. The jawbone sound in your ear is little monotone, but you can clearly hear others. The jawbone fits inside your ear as opposed to the Motorola 820 that rested outside. Also, you have the jawbone sensor that needs to rest on your jawbone. I believe the reason for the snug fit is that it is a requirement for the jawbone to work because it picks up vibrations in your jawbone. I definitely would recommend jawbone; just realize that you are not just replacing an ordinary bluetooth as jawbone has noise cancellation technology and works a little different.",positive
"This phone is clearly a marketing gimmick. The worst reception ever on a cell phone. I have had other phones(all Nokias)that did not have all the bells and whistles of this phone, but I actually received phone calls. If you live in an area that does not have the greatest reception, you will really regret this purchase. I hope I save one poor soul from this phone.",negative
"Hi, I got the Q a week ago, reset it a few times had various other issues.. But fairly happy with the phone.. But... I left the house this morning with a full charge (9 AM), went to lunch at 12:40 and the phone was working fine (full battery charge) - showed it to a friend at lunch, and was trying to bring up Internet Explorer... It couldn't connect to any sites (2 bars) - I said OK, fine and left it alone.. By 2:30 the phone was DEAD, no signs of life, removing the battery, nothing... Attempting to charge it on USB - NO LUCK - (it appears to respect the USB protocol of not drawing any real power until the device tells the host it needs power - something that should be done in hardware/firmware..) I was able to get it to come up with a car adaptor.. Got enough charge on it, and I was able to transfer it to the USB. (First attempt failed, went back and charged it until it stopped beeping) Now, it is sitting there ""charging"" - but burrning power to keep the display on, backlight on, and the CPU running to display an image of a stupid battery 'filling' - which is totally useless (if you are going to show me something, tell me how full my battery CURRENTLY IS), but worse, is likly burning 20-50% of the power it is getting from the USB! I don't think a super large replacement battery would have done ANYTHING for me - except extend the time till it died, maybe as much as 4 hours. My guess is that it locked up while transmitting at full power or something... They say standby of 238 hours or something, but I say better charge it daily, and don't count on it after lunch.. Other than a few really dense things like this, the phone seems pretty good and I like it. I like the idea of a phone and Pda together. -Chert",neutral

"The S-2 was easy to set up and did almost all that it claimed to do (though I could not make the one-touch voice command work...I had to start voice command through my phone menu, then it functioned OK through the headphones). The sound was good, both for listening to music and to voice calls, though people on the other end complained of a bit of echo. The basic concerns I have about the S-2 are that the bluetooth reception seemed to be rather weak. I actually had to start wearing my phone on my right side because when it was on my left side reception would cut out every time I turned my head (for both music and voice). Also, after less than 2-weeks use the arm that holds the right-side headphone broke. It was just in my backpack with a few other light items. When I pulled it out, it was broken. I don't throw my backpack around or treat it carelessly. My expectation is for my headphones to at least be able to survive normal activity and every day wear and tear. If you are going to do anything other than take these off and leave them in the car or on a table when you are done with them, think twice before you purchase the S-2 headphones.",neutral
"Its an ok phone that would be my starting title! why is this, its because the phone its relatively a good phone but you cant compare it to an iPhone after using an iPhone you are just expecting the same features as the iPhone. This is because this phone doesnt let me use an app to check my mac.com email directly from the phone like my iPhone neither its going to be easy setting it up your yahoo or any other non-microsoft application. Youtube works and you can see it ok but not as good as the os from mac that is installed in the iPhone, btw i bought this phone because i was sick and tired of doing workarounds to my hacked iphone so i could use it here in the Republic of Panama. This is a great phone when we talk about the wifi which it gives you a good signal but this phone is not so user friendly and is kinda hard for a person to set it up to make it look like its part of you. This phone has great games though, the screen is great and the 2 megapixels are great! it has great features as video, video calls, night mode, etc! Overall ill give this phone a three stars just because i came from a Ferrari to a Toyota and i think ill stick with my hacked iphone meanwhile nokia comes with a better phone that actual competes against apple's iPhone.

"Only use this a couple of days before returning it. The call button is so stiff, it's next to impossible to press while the headset is in your ear. Even when I held the unit in one hand and pressed the button with the other, you were never sure if the press registered. The volume buttons were not this stiff though. The one PRO I can give this headset is that I was surprised at how high the volume was. I never had problems hearing what I was listening to, whether it was a call or music from the phone.",negative
"While the Pearl shows potential, I am planning to return mine to AT&T within my 30-day evaluation period. This little BlackBerry shows a lot of promise but comes up short as being a reliable phone. This is my first BlackBerry, and even with its marvelous email functionality (bundled with AT&T's $29.99 data plan), I find this device cheaply built and finicky to use. The durability of this unit leaves a lot to be desired. Like some of the cheapest phones on the market this unit features weak flimsy plastic casing. The unit feels like a toy in your hand, especially when removing the battery cover. An optional MicroSD card goes in this area so the battery compartment will need to be accessed over time. Basic phone use is a problem. Battery life is nothing exciting. Like many other phones, the ring volume and call volume just isn't very loud, even at maximum. In noisy areas it becomes hard to have a normal phone call. The ringtone will not play simultaneously while the unit vibrates, so calls are often missed. Historically this has plagued all BlackBerry's. The ""Vibrate+Tone"" mode causes 1-3 vibrations before the ringtone begins. RIM has stated this may be fixed in upcoming units. Answering a call becomes even more difficult using AT&T's OEM leather case. The phone must be pulled out of the case before it can be used; the case has no holes for access while sheathed, or leaving the included headphone plugged in. Safely answering a call in a hands-free manner is near impossible and should not be performed with this phone especially if driving a car. One of the features I was most excited about was the browser. While it offers some basic functionality, it is unable to utilize 90% of what's on the web. Most web sites will not function in this Java based browser, which does not begin to touch what might be accomplished on a device such as an iPhone. Graphics, sounds, music, animation, and Flash all don't work on the Pearl. You can do things like get directions and perform basic Google searches, which remains very useful, but forget any ""fun"". If you can live with the cheap plastic build quality and are in need of email functionality in a small package you might want to consider this phone. Personally I cannot live with a device that is built like a toy and misses so many calls due to simple things like speakers that aren't loud enough and ringtones that cannot happen while the phone vibrates.",negative

"I still love Jawbone in general, and love the form factor of the new one. I find it more subtle than the previous one and not just because it's half the size--the black one seems quite discrete. I have to problems however. First, the thing turns on with just a feather touch. Which means when I carry it in my shirt pocket, it's always turning on. Even when stowed in my briefcase, the thing turns on. Needs some sort of hard case to protect that. Second, personally I've found it harder to get a good fit than the previous one. The previous one, with the metal ear hooks, could be custom fit. While it was a pain to put on, once on it wasn't going anywhere. This new one is easier to put on but is less secure on my head. And when I can't hear someone, my tendency is to push the device closer to my ear--but with the new one, this invariably cancels the call because again, the switches are so sensitive. Still worth it, but quite a bit more finicky.",neutral

"I've used 5 or 6 of these from various manufacturers, and this Manhattan Model 433556 is the best I can find. I use them for installing combination floppy drives / memory card readers. This one is plastic, but sturdy enough to do the job. It allows a standard floppy drive to fit through the hole in the faceplate. The hole in the front is slightly over-sized, so it is also an easy flush-fit for some of the larger FDD / memory reader combination units that have a slightly over-sized form factor. These are often difficult to fit through other brands of mounting bracket face plates. So if you are looking for a flush fit at the front, this one can do it. The mounting screw holes on this one line up better than those on the Bytecc Bracket-525. They could still use a little more slotting to make it easier to do forward and aft adjustments, but overall the holes are acceptable. Also see my review of the Bytecc Bracket-525, which I consider second best. It has a slightly smaller front opening hole that fits the standard floppy drives a little tighter, but still allows them to fit flush. Mounting screw hole alignment is the main disadvantage of the Bytecc Bracket-525. On the Bytecc, they don't line up for a flush fit, and adjustment is almost impossible. The Manhattan is better. The main advantages of the Manhattan Model 433556 are the slightly larger front opening and the better, although not perfect, mounting screw hole alignment.",positive
"I bought this phone to replace the Nokia 8801, which was, basically, a pretty phone . . . So ok, yes, I learned my lesson: Never buy a phone because it's pretty! . . .

"There aren't many case options available for the Lumia 800. I purchased this to replace the previous case I lost, merely looking for something better. I was to say the least, disappointed, and ended up removing the case after a few days and re-buying my previous case. Pros: Looks good Cons: Extremely hard to put on. If you have a full body shield on your phone, it can peel off while removing the case. Too hard, I can't imagine this case absorbing much of the shock if the phone was dropped. Buttons become excessively hard to push, also due to how hard the case is. Conclusion: If all you are just want to prevent scratches, and you don't mind buttons being hard to press, this case might work for you, but if that's the case, I would buy one of the <$2 (shipped) silicone cases. If you want something that actually protects your phone, I felt much more comfortable using the Tire Tread case by igadgitz. Not only is it a thicker soft rubber that will protect my phone if I drop it, the tread design makes the case extra grippy so it doesn't randomly slide out of my pocket or off a table.",negative
"As an previous owner of the original RAZR V3 from about 6-7 years ago, I thought I would give the phone another try despite the negative reviews I read.

The battery after fully charging lasted only 1 day with very little talk time. After 2 charge cycles, it stop charging completely. Calls were constantly being dropped. The paint on the back of the phone was chipping off. This was just the few things I found in the day that I had the phone before returning it for a refund. Amazon refunded my money so I have no complaints about Amazon or the reseller, just the product itself. It is just not a good product by Motorola.

I need to unpaired my cell so I can pair my phone or iPod. Not worth the hassle. Disappointed. Also, it actually blocks out sound pretty well.

Also, as indicated in the user photos in the item listing, the unit I received does not have the same kind of strain relief as the seller's picture (in which the strain relief is separate white tubing); rather, mine has a molded integrated strain relief found in the fourth user picture above. I checked the adapter with an electrical continuity tester, with a male-male TRRS cable plugged into the female end of the adapter. From the adapter's male end, the tip, R1 & R2 are connected through, but the sleeve isn't connected to anything. I don't know if I just have a faulty unit, or if this is the same for all of them.

"It's hard to review this in a way because there are so many variables that make it worthwhile or not worthwhile, depending upon your situation, circumstances and level of expectation. All I can do is explain my circumstances and hope it helps someone. I live way out in the woods, so it's very rural. I'm surrounded by trees on all sides which block my signal considerably. So my signal has always been bad, but then I went and put a metal roof on my house. Had I known it would just about kill my signal I may not have done it, I only learned afterward that a metal roof will do that. So it was a lousy connection before the metal roof, then with the metal roof I started getting dropped calls, etc. Just a terrible experience. I had to sit in a certain place, with my head in a certain direction to talk and even then it often wouldn't work, I was constantly cutting out or getting dropped. So I did my research and decided I liked the idea of the WeBoost brand; they seemed reputable and had a fairly clear explanation of their products, various videos, etc. I would have liked the next model up, which requires installing an exterior antenna, but it wasn't practical in my circumstance. I live alone, I'm disabled, I don't have anyone to climb up to my roof to install the antenna, heck; I don't even own a tall ladder. And I can't afford to hire someone to do it either, so this model seemed more feasible without much hassle. Also, I've found that my ""best spot"" seems to change with the season, the dropping of leaves on the trees, the snow or lack of snow, etc., and I really didn't like the idea of a permanently placed antenna that's not easily adjustable. So with this model, I can move it to a different window if needed, or even change the angle slightly from inside, which I like. So I ordered the EQO model, because it's all interior and no roof mounting. I have to say, it's by far the best labeled/packaged product I've ever seen. Every part is in its own bag, labeled with a big Step 1, Step 2, etc on it. Good instructions too. Everything is very clearly spelled out and well marked. So one downside, or something to consider at least: It took A LOT of experimenting, location-wise. I spent a week or so moving it around to different windows, up high, down low, you name it. This thing is VERY touchy. The SLIGHTEST angle change can make a HUGE difference in reception, at least in my experience. So in my case (and much to my surprise) I ended up not using the little window antenna at all. That's the little part that goes between your glass and screen. It seems the boost it might have received wasn't worth the loss of signal from the extra cable, so in other words, connecting a 3rd part counter-acted the benefit. So I set that aside, set the larger antenna just inside the window (interior window sill, table near window, etc) and continued experimenting with my arrangement that way. A big challenge is that the two larger pieces (interior antenna and booster) have to face the same direction and you only have the length of the cable to work with. They also can't be too close together. Then you have to figure out which window to use, so it can be tricky. I finally learned (after a call to tech support) that the booster and the antenna should really be at very similar heights; I had the antenna in a window and the booster on top of a tall bookshelf before discovering that it was much better if I moved the booster from the top of the shelf down to the middle shelf. Also, a clear line of sight between the two components is ideal. The range being advertised as ""up to 1200 square feet"" can be VERY misleading. ""Up to"" is the key, so I'd take that with a grain of salt to be honest. Maybe if that 1200 feet is one large open space (no walls, etc) and if the outside signal is fairly strong to begin with; again, so many variables! I'm sure plenty of people do get that much coverage, but just don't count on it, that's all I'm saying. For example: My entire house is very small, 750 sq feet. So one might think this would cover my whole house, right? Nope. After doing a ridiculous amount of component acrobats and creative placement, I'm able to talk in 2 small connecting rooms, which are side by side and I have the booster right by the doorway of those two rooms, sort of splitting the 180 degree range between the rooms. But I still have no improvement in my bedroom, dining room, kitchen, bath or hall. So I basically had to decide which area was most important for a signal. I chose my office and my living room because those are the two primary places where I might use the phone. So, here's where ""expectation"" and ""variables"" both come in. Some people would be furious at this, angry that it only covers two small rooms. For me personally? I'm fairly happy. Happy enough to keep it, let's put it that way. I don't have a home phone, so I rely on my cell phone. I'm also very flexible and willing to compromise. So for me it's good, I can now talk in my office and in my living room without dropped calls and without constantly saying ""WHAT?"" ""WAIT, YOU'RE CUTTING OUT. WHAT?"". So I have to say ""hang on a minute"" if I need to get a glass of water in the kitchen. For me, that's not a big deal. For other people, that might be a big deal, we're all different. I did call their customer support, twice actually. The first time I got a very friendly girl who unfortunately didn't really know what she was talking about and seemed generally unfamiliar with this particular model. She told me several incorrect things and I found myself correcting her and reading parts of the manual to her, so that was a bit useless. I sensed I'd get better results with a different person so I called back later and got a young guy who was extremely helpful and knowledgeable. He's the one who suggested I try and put the antenna and booster at the same general height as each other, and he also told me that the slightest angle can make a big difference, so I stopped moving it from room to room and instead tried changing the angle ever so slightly before ruling out a location. He also helped me understand my dBm readings, I understood that lower is better, but I was confused by seeing multiple network types, 4G, 3G, 1X, etc with varying dBm readings for each, and wasn't sure which one I should be ""aiming for"", so to speak. He helped me a lot by saying I don't really need to worry about the 4G, if I can get the 3G in a good spot that's all I need. So that simplified my troubleshooting a lot. This may be a Verizon-specific issue by the way, I'm not sure. I ended up going from 106 (on a clear day and if I was lucky) to 120 (almost non existent signal; borderline dead zone) before the WeBoost to 88 on a good day to 98 on a bad day. Either way it's a good enough signal to talk without dropped calls and without repeating myself constantly. But again, that's only in two small rooms. Between the number of variables along with different levels of expectation by the customer, I can see how someone would be thrilled or hate it or anywhere in between. The good news however, is that you can try it and return it if it doesn't work for you. I can't stress enough however, how much of the slightest change of angle or height can change the signal strength. So if you have the patience, I suggest doing a lot of playing around with it before you decide it doesn't work. To illustrate my point, my booster is toward the front of a small table and it's perfect. If I move it to the back of that table, back only 6 or so inches, the signal decreases drastically. So it's THAT sensitive. Once I found the ""sweet spot"" I was very pleased, all things considered (woods, metal roof, rural, etc).",positive
"The good: Finally! An all-in-one device that actually does everything pretty well! A couple years ago I bought a Sidekick thinking it would do it all. It did, but it did everything rather badly. The feedback on the phone line was so bad that everyone I talked to complained about hearing their own voices coming back to them. I ended up swapping my SIM card back and forth between my trusty Motorola for phone calls, and the Sidekick to browse the web. As a web browser, it was better than nothing, but only slightly. It was awfully slow and timed out a lot. As a PDA, it wasn't too impressive either. The features were so stripped down that I ended up going back to my old Ipaq. So I was schlepping around three gadgets, and carrying an oversized purse to make room for them all. By contrast, the 6315 has excellent sound quality as a phone. As a PDA, it is great - just what I'm used to. As a web browser, its speed is decent using GPRS, better with WIFI. Plus Bluetooth! And I have always loved the fact that Ipaqs have downsized versions of MS Word and Excel so that I can keep a running expense log, and do some writing when I have a spare minute. Thus, despite the many problems I'll mention, I am pretty content with my 6315. Also, while some have groused that the Ipaq is only available with T-Mobile right now, for me this is a positive. I use my phone ALL THE TIME, and I was fortunate enough to latch onto T-Mobile's 3,000 anytime minutes for $49.99 plan a few years ago. There is no other company that has a comparable plan, with a comparable selection of gadgets and phones, for anywhere close to that price! The bad: There are some bugs that need to be worked out. The phone turns itself off for no apparent reason now and then, and I discover hours after the fact that all my calls have been going to voicemail. Also, even when I set it to require the PIN before making a call, sometimes it does, sometimes it does not. When I have the earphone plugged in, the phone makes no external sound whatever. So if I make a call using the headset, and then just take off the headset without unplugging, all my calls and alerts are inaudible. It's not as hands free as I would like. On my Motorola, I could just hit one button to open my phone book, scroll down a set number of times (1 for Mom, 2 for Dad, 3 for best friend, etc.), and then hit another button to send the call, all without taking my hand off the steering wheel or my eyes off the road. The Ipaq requires both hands and my full attention to turn it on, access my contact list, navigate to the right person, and click the link that will make the call. In other words, it demands more attention than a car radio, and is thus unsafe to use while driving. Grr! The downright irritating: If you hold the device up to your ear to take a call, your cheek or jaw WILL touch the touch screen, setting off all manner of other functions or disconnecting the call. There needs to be some way of disabling the screen when you want to. The only solution I've found is springing another $30 for an INNOPOCKET aluminum case, which lets you at most of the buttons but protects the screen behind an acrylic window. If you have WiFi on, your browsing will be interrupted constantly as new WiFi sites are detected, and God help you if there is a T-Mobile hotspot anywhere nearby! You will be rerouted to a security screen asking for registration and password, and even if you don't want to use the Hotspot and pay T-Mobile charges, you cannot get away from this screen!!! I hate this so much that I only use WiFi when I'm darned sure there are no T-Mobile stores anywhere nearby. For whatever reason, T-Mobile sells the 6315 but none of the accessories, and in my experience, the sales reps at T-Mobile stores know diddly about the device's compatibility issues. They offered me a Jabra Bluetooth headset, but fortunately I had read up in advance and knew that it was incompatible. HP's website has a list of compatible Bluetooth devices, but T-Mobile doesn't sell any of them. T-Mobile also does not sell the car charger, the spare AC charger, the extended battery, memory cards, etc. Most of these you have to get from HP online, and pay a premium price for them. Forget the camera entirely. It is worthless. I do enjoy being able to download photos from my digital camera, though - it's like having a wallet full of photos to show off to my friends. The Upshot: If you're looking for a gadget that does it all reasonably well, the 6315 is that device. There is lots of room for improvement, and it's possible that the Treo 650 will outpace it in the coming months, and I'm eagerly looking forward to the release of the Flipstart hopefully sometime next year. But at the moment, the 6315 is the best there is, and while some of the problems are annoying, it's worth it to be able to carry a tiny purse again!",neutral
"Due to a software issue between Nokia and Sprint this phone's text messaging capabilities don't work with Sprint's system and won't until a software patch comes out ""some time in the next few months"". You will have to spend at least 1 hour with Sprint's award winning customer service team to find someone who will admit this to you. The problem is that Nokia designed their phones so that incoming messages are retrieved quickly and then viewed ""offline"" the way most providers work.

Soon after I bought this phone the outside material began to peel off the phone. I have had more dropped calls with this phone than with any other t-mobile phone I have ever had - it even drops calls when I have a signal and have not moved. People can hardly ever hear what I am saying. To add to this the other day it turned itself off and would not turn on for over a day. I have had to go back to using my old phone after a few months because I could not rely on this phone to work (or stay turned on).,negative
"The phone arrived about a week after I ordered it. The back of the phone would not stay snapped on with the battery in place, and I sent email to the vendor, but it was the subsequent seller feedback that produced a response. We swapped about one email a day regarding the back cover. I do not know if the fellow was busy, or if I was on a leash. (I suspect the latter.) After about four days of emails, the seller sent a new cover. I have not yet received said cover, though the email tells me it's in the mail, but being in a hurry, I applied tape to the back cover, and proceeded to get the phone ready for use. I had forgotten the pure simplicity that is this phone. However, that pleasure was not to last. First, the phone is not new as indicated in the sales copy. It's a refurbished device that was first sold for use on the T-Mobile network, which is apparent when the phone comes on. It's also apparent from the back cover being a different shade of silver from the rest of the phone, and then, of course, there's the problem with the cover popping off. The phone makes calls. It sends texts. It will take pics. However, it will not send a picture to another phone (MMS). After some delay, an error message appears on the screen indicating a ""send"" error. There is no suggestion I've found for tweaking the network settings to make MMS function. I'm at a loss regarding what to do about this phone. Update (25 October 2010) The replacement cover arrived today. It is wrong on two counts. First, it has two tabs at the bottom whereas the phone only has one slot. Second, the cover is too short. I sent return email to that effect. Update (28 October 2010) Yesterday, the seller requested the IMEI number for the phone. I suppose the intent is to resolve the MMS issue. Given that T-Mobile and AT&T do not appear to use the same frequency for 3G, I doubt much will happen there. Then again, the seller could be looking for a back cover that fits AND stays on. Update (29 October 2010) After sending the IMEI number for the phone twice yesterday, it was requested once more today. The request came with a note that a return shipping label would soon be sent. Update (02 December 2010) Toward the middle of November, this mess all ended. The phone returned to the vendor. The sale was reversed.",negative

"I bought the strongest lithium batteries (8 x )and they only lasted 2 or 3 days in this device, not 6 or 7 as the manufacturer suggests. The thing turns off for the night at one location and turns back on in the middle of the day, at another location that is 100's of miles away from where it turned off the night before. When it's on, the information it records is excellent, but it's never on, so it's useless. This device has been used for MONTHS and has NEVER recorded accurately. I contacted the manufacturer who suggested it was a signal problem. The device had a signal and recorded the location when it turned off for the night, it should have had the same signal the next morning when the vehicle started moving, at the same location, but it didn't. The manufacturer suggests moving the device around...no matter where it was put, nothing helped. Also,the manufacturer sells this device to be used ""covertly"" but doesn't advertise that it may be illegal to use it ""covertly"". I would not recommend purchasing this item. You waste alot of time and money retrieving the device and buying and changing the batteries only to download the information it recorded and find out you're missing days, miles and hours or information it missed because it didn't automatically turn on, like it's supposed to. If you need a tracker and can use a hard wire device, buy a hard wire type that can be monitored in ""real"" time, you will pay more initially , but for what I've spent buying lithium batteries every three days, I could have bought the more expensive, hard wire, real time, better device.",negative

"Originally I had purchased Supertooth II which had a powerful speaker but died within 3 weeks. Blueant customer service told me that they were aware of the problems with Supertooth II and had discontinued it and they replaced it with Supertooth Light, which I have used for about 4 months. The voice quality of Blueant Supertooth Light is better than my factory installed Cadillac Bluetooth phone. Speakerphone is fairly powerful for such a small package but the sound is not always crystal clear. Listeners at the other end sometimes complain of muffled voice. Still, it is better than using the cell phone itself next to your ear. Pairing with cell phone is very easy and the animated guides at Blueant's web site are very helpful. Battery life is amazingly long, sometimes lasting a month! It sticks very securely to the magnetic attachment for the visor. Customer service was fairly helpful, but not outstanding, took 3 weeks to replace my dead Supertooth II.

"I've used the Plantronics Voyager 510 for a few months and have been quite satisfied with the length of the battery charge, reception, volume, and ability for others to hear me speak clearly. The size of the headset is large compared to other headsets on the market and this is the only downside to this item. Other headsets may look ""sleek"", ""chic"", or more ""cool"", but if good earpiece volume and clear transmission of your voice is critical, this is the headpiece for you. If the size of the headset the goes behind the ear was slightly slimmer, I'd give it a full five stars. The interchangeable earbuds are somewhat tricky to remove once installed. That's the only other downside to this unit. Otherwise, a great headset. I enjoy mine a great deal. Update to my previous review (August 2010): After using this headset for over two years, I'm still fairly satisfied. The only problems I've had was one of the earbuds was broken off after I mistakenly put the earpiece in my briefcase with several items the pressed against it. Fortunately, there are two other earbuds included with the headset and I easily replaced the broken one. Also, after a period of time, I've noticed the foam cover for the earbuds tends to split at the seam. If you're purchasing this headset for the first time, it may be worth your money to buy and extra earbud/foam covers set. Another problem is the headset momentarily disconnecting with my cell phone, then connecting back. At this time, I don't know whether that is a result of problems with the headset or the phone. Otherwise, it has served me well and I've yet to have had anyone tell me that my voice was difficult to hear or understand while conversing in a variety of noisy conditions. Considering how long I've used this headset and it's performance to date, I can still recommend it to potential buyers. Another update to my previous review (September, 2010). Since my last update, another issue has arisen with this headset. The rubber material that houses the wiring and is the part that bends over your ear, has cracked in two areas. One is closer to the top (near the on/off switch), the other is at the end of the rubber ""tube"" just above the earpiece. At the latter location, the rubber is literally crumbling to pieces and exposing the wire cord within. This is a very recent development and seems to be a part of decay based on age. I realize after 2 1/2 years that no Bluetooth headset will look like new, but if this deterioration keeps up, a significant portion of the wire that runs from the battery to the earpiece/mic will be exposed. When taking the construction into consideration, there's no way to replace this portion of the headset. Short of wrapping the rubber in electrical tape (which would only give an unsightly and temporary fix), the only other solution is buying another one. But, that doesn't make sense since the item is still in perfect working order, has a great earpiece with clear sound, and I've yet to have anyone complain about the quality of my voice through the mic, even when I was in a noisy environment. Final update to two previous updates (September, 2010). The problem I wrote about in my last update has made me decide to never consider this model again. The rubber portion that fits over my ear literally crumbled into several pieces two days ago. Not only did this make the earpiece useless, but the wiring broke off from the circuit board that's in the piece that goes behind your ear. Long story short, don't buy this model and expect to get several years of use. If you're lucky and VERY careful in the way you carry, store, & use this item, you'll be lucky to get two years of use out of it. Otherwise, I can't recommend it since there are so many other models that are equal to or better for less money. I'll generously give it three stars...was tempted to give it only two, but the boom mic is an asset...noise reduction is better than average...but that's about all.",neutral

This was an easy fix- a little super glue did the trick. The next problem came when the expansion spring-like vise that holds the phone snug began to act up. When you put the phone in, you open the vise, place the phone in, and then snug it up. After a couple of months, this became a difficult manuever, with the vise getting jammed regularly. The final straw was when the suction cup stopped working properly, leaving me with the entire setup falling down at the most inopportune times. Strike three, into the landfill you go.

"Purchased two Blueant Supertooth 3's for my Camry and Passat. Sound quality from the speaker and what the caller can hear was decent, although since this is my first bluetooth speakerphone, I'm not sure how this stacks up against the competition. Cruising on the freeway, a caller knows you are on a speakerphone, but can still hear relatively clearly (at least in my vehicles). Setup was a breeze - took me less than 10 minutes to sync my contact list with my 2 phones - a Verizon LG Chocolate 3 and Verizon LG Dare. You have a choice between 2 English voices, and a few other European languages. Automatic pairing works as advertised, provided that the last phone connected is the one to be paired next. I also liked the magnetic visor clip - a nice touch when you need to detach to charge. Package includes both an AC and DC charger, which is nice. Unusual for an electronic product, the unit comes with a 2-year warranty, although I have not used it yet (and hopefully never will) to test its true usefulness. Now the cons. The biggest one for me is the inability to automatically pair if the phone was not the last one connected. This is not an issue if you are using just one phone. But if you have 2 phones (you drive one day, your wife drives another), this is a major inconvenience. Even if the last phone connected is turned off or out-of-range, and another phone enters range which was previously sync'ed, it will not find the phone. You have to manually connect through your phone menu. Another major setback is the inability to consistently announce the contact name if the contact has more than one number. So one number will result in the contact name being announced, and the other will result in the number being read. Why doesn't Blueant know that a contact can have multiple numbers? There is a possibility that this is a phone or carrier specific problem - again, I have a LG Chocolate 3 and LG Dare both on Verizon. Minor gripes include a 2-3 second delay in announcing terminated calls after pressing the red button, and the lack of customization when it comes to the voices and alert sounds. After living with the units for a few weeks, I would give them so far a solid 3 stars.",neutral

"I bought those to replace my LG HBS-730 after they started freaking out on my and were out of warranty. I decided I might as well try the Motorola Buds in case they were more resistant to sweat, see I run with those things on. Well I regret my purchase now, the Buds start freaking out after mile 2, as soon as I start sweating a little, it doesn't take much. The volume and skip buttons stop responding or press themselves without user input and the power button stops working. The buds start working again once they dry out but the second part of your run is screwed. In addition to that the Buds themselves are a little narrow and stiff, which means putting them on makes you worried about splitting them apart. To add insult to injury the power button is placed in the worst possible place, in the center back and on the underside which is very awkward to operate if you have them on. You kinda have to take them on and off to turn them on or off. Bad bad bad design. I might have to buy LG again even though they ended up dying but they lasted months before they were irreparably damaged by sweat (I'm assuming) compared to the Buds which started failing immediately but do come back to life when dry (which is why they get two stars instead of one).",negative
"I have no compunction telling people not to buy this stupid thing. I've owned two, now...both broke. (The only reason I owned the second one is that it was a free replacement.) Jawbone's engineers should read ""Quality is Free"" by Philip B. Crosby (or one of his more recent books). They'd learn that it's cheaper to do something right the first time than to deal with the problems caused by shoddy design. They wasted money sending me a replacement, and now they're losing more money because of the bad reputation they're getting (I'll certainly never buy another). Surely at some point someone at Jawbone must have thought to themselves, ""you know, this connection between the headset and the charger is so damn tight it's going to pull the back of the headset off eventually."" It's so obvious, how could nobody notice!? Yet they decided to go ahead anyway. The height of stupidity and laziness. Fix your problems before you ship!",negative
"Received headset for xmas, but could not get it to work properly with my computer. Motorola's level 2 tech support finally told me that it probably wasn't compatible with my desktop. What products are it compatible with then, I asked? ""phones and some video games"". When THAT is your level 2 support, it's pretty clear that you have no intention of actually helping the customer... Since the headphones were a gift, it's too late to return them - only question now is whether they have any value on eBay or if they go in the garbage.",negative

We had to keep connecting it. Returned it.",negative

"Positives: the noise cancelation works well and is a nice feature, Blue Tooth recognition is quick, easy and reliable over long separations between base and headset. And unlike another Amazon reviewer I have as good a result with the Motorola Razr and voice recognition as I have with any other headset. The appearance of the Jawbone is kind of spiffy, which you would expect from any product designed by Yves Behar and the people at Fuseproject Design in San Francisco. Negatives: there are little parts that tend to come off and the ear piece tends to get tangled up with things in your pocket and get bent. For instance there is a rubber cover for the charger connector terminals. I lost this in the second day of use and haven't seen it since. The rubber ear pieces tend not to stay put, but they give you spares of these. I may take to glueing these in place. There is no obvious place to put this thing when it is not on your head. A shirt pocket clip, of the sort that you find on a fountain pen, might help. Conclusions: I liked the out-of-production Jabra BT500 very much. This sat behind the ear, like a hearing aid. The ergonomics on the Jabra were just about perfect, but the Jabra BT500 is now out of production, and the follow on Jabra is said to be easily broken in normal use. The Jawbone is as good a head set as any on the present market. No vendor seems to have a really outstanding solution at the moment. This is kind of surprizing given the number of people who rely on these tools. Industrial designers awake! The world needs a better headset: one that defines the genre!",neutral
"$50 at Costco, I figured worth a try. I hate it when I'm working around the yard and my headphone wire gets caught on the weedeater, lawnmower, whatever - a real drag. My son has the first edition LG Tone [It's on the 3rd edition now, Tone+ has improved audio but awful BT connectivity, jury is out on just released Tone Pro] and I may try one of those next. Comes with a Quick Start Guide, which gives easy pairing and connecting instructions and also the basics of controls and operation. Guess what? If you want to full manual - it doesn't exist! No kidding. I searched all over the Motorola site and the quick start guide is all that's available. So for example if you changed the EQ from the default (which I assume to be flat) and hear the unnecessary voice, ""EQ changed!"" you may wonder -changed to what? What are the EQ presets? You'll never find out, that info is apparently classified. Sound is OK but not impressive. Plenty of bass and no obvious lacking in the upper mids and highs, but no ""Oh, yeah!"" factor - which I suppose is not to be expected from such an inexpensive rig. No big Con there. [Disclaimer: last summer I scored a Bose QC15 set off you-know-what at an insanely cheap price, for my flights to Japan. Then when I got back I flipped it and made $100 profit. Heck with that, should have kept it. Best sound I ever heard, as expected from a (retail) $250 set. Sold 'em. Dumb.] They are very lightweight and comfortable, but the earbud cables are a bit too short - they pull when I turn my head. The pilot (on-off) light is a tiny and dim blue LED that's impossible to view in sunlight; you have to cup your hands over it with your face close up to see if it's turning on or off. Then recently they refused to connect with my phone unless I un-and re- paired them. And that led to the headset being returned, unacceptable.",neutral

This didn't do much of anything as far as boosting signal. My phone shows 1 to 2 bars and it didn't get any better with this device.

"I researched myself to death weighing the options between a new wireless headset for a perfectly good home office landline phone (between $225 & $270) or a whole new phone with Bluetooth syncing. Loved the idea of getting one that would merge the iPhone (half of my calls come in on) and the land line (other half come in on). Seven grey hairs later I decided on Plantronics Calisto Pro. Every review on Amazon and elsewhere were read, condsidered, manufacturer websites researched and Big Box stores visited. In the end I opted to for the Calisto Pro. First to Mac users, go to the website. The software updates are there so the anti-Mac reviews are outdated or under researched. For those who wrote it's difficult to put the headset into the charger...you need to gently push the headset in making sure the ear loop rests in the indentation until you hear a click. It sets in securely. No tapping needed. Now if you remove the handset or headset and put them back in both will start to charge again. Initial appearances (charge battery icon on the handset and red light on the headset) make it look as if neither has fully charged. They have. 3 hours for the headset and just over 15 hours until the handset said it was charged. Handset is light. Some have called it 'cheap' feeling. My only 'cheap' feel is the light tension spring on the belt clip. Then again it's not designed for sweat pants... It's very nice to be able to sync my Outlook contacts. Make sure they are nice and neat killing duplicates or seperate entries for the same person. You have 200 contacts and each contact can have up to 3 numbers. The program allows you to check off which ones you want to sync with the phone which is a nice option. I didn't need the pet sitter on the Calisto for example. I agree the buttons are on the small side and I have small hands. Not as much of importance to me as is extremely clear speaker phone, mobility (no longer teathered to the phone!!) and a comfortable headset all of which syncs with the iPhone 3G seamlessly. Regarding the speakerphone on hand and head set...I hear with perfect clarity on both with volume adjustment being independent. Callers state they can hear me perfectly either source but state the headset sounds as if I were in the same room. My home is a Wi-Fi zoo. There are more waves bouncing off of walls than Carters makes liver pills! That being said the majority of signals on all devices are 'very good' unless you're sitting on a router. My microwave killed calls on a different cordless before. There were no interruptions on any calls. I noted a hum on my end but callers heard nothing and if I weren't in 'test mode' and searching for things wrong with the performance I probably wouldn't have noticed. Note: this is with the volume up high. My personal preference is to set on high & I'll probably pay for in later years, but I like my phone calls up high to not miss a word. Note on the syncing of the headset...turn off the headset, then turn on when the phone is in search mode. Instructions give the impression you should wait for the cell to find the headset but move to the next step and you'll sync ASAP. The unit comes with a very limited quick start guide. This phone can do MUCH more than it first looks like. PRINT THE 61 PAGE GUIDE FROM PLANTRONICS WEBSITE!! Tons of helpful info and Plantronics does have a great support site and help system. Easy screen menu...perhaps a little antiquated in apperance but clear and functional. I like the calls answered//missed/dialed feature. How many times have you made a call and need to re-dial that number 5 calls later but can't? This unit lets you see them all. The phone book search has shortcuts...again print the guide off of the website. Agreed no phone is perfect. Like building your own home even if you think you thought of everyting you'll find something missing eventually. This phone could benefit from either larger or rubberized buttons for folks with larger fingers or long nails, but if you want ONE home/home office unit with complete mobility (no 4' wired cord) which syncs seamlessly with your cell on one bluetooth headset this is it.",positive
"Overall, Samsung delivered once again. I use this with my Samsung Omnia and music clarity was excellent to over 70ft. At that point it wasn't choppy or digitalized, they just beeped to let me know I was out of range. Talk quality was great, no noise complaints from people I was speaking with. Wearing them for the first couple of hours did cause some discomfort, but the ears get used to them. Even with 1/2"" plugs in your ears. Battery life was excellent. I work in an office setting, and it would last for a 10+ hr shift as long as I didn't have the volume cranked on them. They are a bit bulky, but the sound quality makes up for that. I enjoy the fact that I could pair two devices to them without having to pair them over and over. Worked great for my cell phone and laptop. Gave the item 4 out of 5 because they do take some getting used to, and can be a bit uncomfortable at first.",positive
"I agree with the gentleman who had the comment on the poor battery performance. I had this phone about 10 days ago and I noticed this problem already. The camera has a poor quality as well. You can see strange shining from the high lighted part of the picture. The most serious problem would be the poor battery performance. I took a test on this cell phone since I got this cell phone new. It can only last about 3 days w/t any call or camera use, and the call time could only last less than a hour. After the a call, the phone will die very soon. which means you'll have to get the travel charger wherever you go. Its battery life is even worse than my old NOkia cellphone. I'm returning it.",negative
"I have had this phone for about 3 weeks now. My review, broken down into pros and cons: PROS: - Big screen, awesome display - nice keyboard - very SLIM, especially compared to the chunky Blackberry - E-mail looks like real e-mail, not like MS-DOS (as the blackberry does) - Rubberized back is very nice to grip and hold, and very slim - Usability is decent - T-Mobile staff was helpful and nice and seem to really want to help (unlike Sprint) CONS: - Windows constantly crashes and skips from one application to another (I am on a webpage, and inexplicably, it skips to e-mail or some other app. Very, very annoying, over time). - FREEZING: within 3 weeks, I have had to ""hard boot"" (remove the battery to get the thing to work again) 5 times. On average, more than once a week. Also, very annoying. Windows Mobile is about as stable as Brittney Spears on a weekend in Vegas. - BATTERY: Battery power is very limited, particularly in Wi-Fi. normal battery power is o.k., but Wi-Fi sucks a LOT of power. Overall, I give this product three stars. The battery and the instability of the MS-Windows operating system remain major concerns. I still can give this product a thumbs up and positive review, but just barely...",neutral
"What can I say that hasn't already been said? This is THE best bluetooth I have used, hands down. People that I'm talking to on it say I sound better using the Voyager Pro than just using the handset alone. Upon trying it just once, a friend of mine bought one for himself.",positive

"At first Glance, the phone seems to have almost everything that you wanted. After a while you might realize that you got more than what you bargained for! For instance you might notice that it is really cumbersome to use the round shaped keypad. Than you may notice that the 3650 likes to turn it self off sometimes even when the key lock is active! Sometimes it just locks up and freezes, other times it auto dials your friends, it must be telepathic. Other than all of that, the blue tooth software runs like a charm. Oh and did I mention that even after you unplug the ear peace the phone still tells you that you are using your head set :-)",negative

I returned them, got another set, charged it up, and !!?? the same thing happened. Won't power up. I give. FWIW, this product lists for three different prices on Amazon. I got the ""white box"" version, whatever that is. Came in a white box, no clamshell packaging, just the headsets, charger, and manual in a box. Maybe they are reconditioned--at the price I paid, around $25, they probably are--but if so it wasn't mentioned by either vendor (TigerDirect and CellShop). But reconditioned or not, the darn things ought to at least turn on. I would think that's the minimum one should expect from electronic gear.",negative

I understand the the cell phone is a little big compared to the other cell phones but think about with how many cell phones can you take a picture quality as good as the Nokia 3650? How many cell phones can you connect your laptop to the modem in the cell phone and also I don't think many cell phone come with a video recorder. Looking at all these features in a small gadget like this I am amazed at the sleekness of the 3650 phone. I have now been using it for quite sometime and I am happy with the performance. The only disadvantage would be that the screen is a little delicate a gets scrateches but since it is not an expensive replacement and also if you take care or buy cover for the cellphone you should be fine. -Abhishek ([...],positive

"My biggest frustration with this headset is trying to get my phone to understand voice commands when traveling in a car with road noise, etc. It's almost useless that way. I have it paired with a Blackberry Curve. Voice commands work great directly with the phone, but I guess there's just too much background noise when speaking through the mic. I haven't tried any other headsets, so I don't know if that's just a problem with this one, or if it's a common problem with bluetooth headsets. Added Dec. 26, 2009: I have since upgraded my phone to a BlackBerry Tour, and this headset wouldn't even pair with it.

"I previously used the original Jawbone, became a big fan of Aliph's noise-cancellation technology, and was looking forward to the new Jawbone 2 to solve the few minor poblems that I had with the original such as excessive wind noise in even a minimal breeze. After reading the reviews here and noting the wide variance in customer satisfaction, primarily due to poor fit problems, I also purchased both the clear Jabra regular Gels and the Mini-Gels, that some others claimed to be the solution to the fit problem, along with the new Jawbone 2. I can confirm that the biggest issue is poor fit - no matter what combination of the supplied 4 earhooks and 3 rubber earbuds that I used, I could not keep the unit in my ear or keep the white voice sensor nub in constant contact with my cheek. This constant cheek contact is critical for noise suppression to work properly and to prevent distorting or clipping your own transmitted speech. I first tried the regular Jabra Gels (package of 6 complex-shaped earbuds) but found that they did not fit tightly enough onto the Jawbone 2 ear post. Next I tried the Mini-Gels which consisted of 2 small round earbuds and 2 larger oval earbuds. The oval Mini-Gel earbuds worked perfectly for me but there were a couple installation tips and tricks needed to get proper fit: First, the oval Mini-Gel fits over the Jawbone 2 ear post very tightly and it takes a bit of effort to carefully stretch it to fit over the Jawbone ear post. Once seated, it is almost impossible to rotate the oval Mini-Gel's angle in relation to the Jawbone's microphone boom, so position it correctly initially (see next tip for proper position). Secondly, the end of the oval, furthest from the ear post, must be positioned between 0 degrees and 20 degrees above the axis of the microphone boom in order to seat into my ear properly and have the voice sensor nub at the end of the microphone boom properly seated against my cheek (thank you to the other reviewer who put me on the right track with his 15 degree above angle). Thirdly, to wear this combination properly, insert the oval Mini-Gel into your ear with the Jawbone microphone boom slightly above horizontal, and then rotate the Jawbone downward so the microphone boom is pointing somewhere between the tip of your nose and your lips. This combination fits me snugly and coomfortably without the need to use any earloop. I can usually wear it all day without hardly adjusting it. So now that I have proper fit, my Jawbone 2 finally performs as intended. The noise-cancellation is excellent and the wind noise has been greatly improved. However, had I not discovered the Jabra oval Mini-Gel solution, I would have returned the Jawbone 2 as being totally unusable due to poor fit with the supplied selection of earloop and earbud accessorys. Hopefully, Aliph is paying attention and will license the Mini-Gels from Jabra! With proper fit for my Jawbone 2, my Pros and Cons: Pros - best of any headset for background noise cancellation and fairly good wind noise removal, extremely light weight and comfortable, good battery life (although less than original Jawbone), improved magnetic charger cable. Cons - while the front surface pushswitch to answer/end a call is now much easier to activate compared to the original, the problem has now become that it's almost impossible to adjust the headset position without inadvertently pushing the answer/end talk button and hanging up a call, even when attempting to only grip the side surfaces of the unit. Bottom line: Make sure it fits you well or you will be very disappointed in the performance. If necessary, buy the clear Jabra Mini-Gels (not the regular Jabra Gels) for proper fit. Buy the Jawbone 2 from someplace that will let you return it if you cannot get it to fit your ear/face. If you can get it to fit, it will be the best headset you have owned.",neutral

"Overall I like this headset. It is the first one I've ever owned and I certainly like the convenience of being able to use my phone even when my hands are full. It is lightweight and easy to set up. The issues I have with it are: It is awkward to wear over your ear when you are also wearing glasses. The power button is difficult to operate, although I guess that helps to prevent it from accidentally turning off. But someone with very large fingers or arthritis would probably be very frustrated. I actually have to use a fingernail. It sometimes disconnects from my phone on its own. But MOST disconcerting is that my phone somehow automatically dials the last number in its memory when I have the headset connected, without me knowing it. So I can be having a person to person conversation with one person, while another person is being called by my phone. If the called person answers their phone they can hear my conversation without me ever knowing a phone call was made. Very eerie to be unknowingly overheard. And a waste of my minutes. I'm told that this is a problem inherent with bluetooth headsets in general, so now I only turn my headset on when I actually want to make a call instead of leaving it on all the time. Or I just use my phone the old school way! :) So for me, it's probably a lot of money for only a little convenience.",neutral
"I bought this for my wife for the convenience of having her hands free while driving, or in the kitchen, or working in the yard. My first bluetooth was this model, but when I used it people complained that the mike picked up too much ambient noise and had a noticeable echo. Other than that one complaint, everything else worked fine. The range was as advertised as well as the talk and standby time. The battery charged quickly and lasted for several days, depending on how much I talked (of course), and it paired easily with the MOTORAZR V3m. I upgraded to the H-700 because of its noise suppression chip, but was very disappointed with it. The range was horrible, and had to deal with a lot of static. The noise suppression chip is worthless. I retired the 700 and I'm using something else now. The H-500 headset is not the best one out there, but for the money it is better than the H-700 hands down.",neutral

So I finally got it attached to the outside screen with just a few small bubbles, but gave up on the inside screen. I am happy to have a screen protector on the outside screen, and the small bubbles that I could not remove do not interfere with using the touch screen or seeing the screen. If you are good at this sort of thing, get these to protect your touch screen. Maybe you can get someone who isn't a klutz to put them on for you!",neutral

There was a huge surprise, the sound in my headphones sound distorted, and when I unplugged it and plugged it back in, it still sounded distorted. Eventually the adapter did work, when it wanted to. I did a little troubleshooting, and it was the adapter that caused the audio distortion. Why this occurred I really don't know why. One day I accidentally, dropped one of the adapters into my soda, and after that, it works when it wants to, now I use the other one, and that works a lot better then the other adapter I dropped in my soda, but it still has its days where you can hear distortion.

Once you scratch the screen protector, it skews the colors appear underneath the scratch, so the longer you use it, the worse it gets.

"Although ""argh"" serves as a perfect summation of my thoughts on this product, Amazon requires more than a one word statement before letting you post a review so I'll go ahead and share the entire story of my purchase on the off chance someone will read it and smirk. Back in the day I used to buy either the ""official"" component cables for game systems or Monster's products IN STORE at the time of the console's launch without batting an eyelash at the price. As the years went by I read all kinds of articles about how the only stand out quality of these supposedly superior cables was their profit margin, so I swore to never buy from the likes of Monster again and in fact laughed in the face of somebody who told me they ""had to"" spend hundreds of dollars on HDMI cables alone after purchasing an HDTV. My ""enlightened"" viewpoint was reinforced mostly by a string of successful purchases from BlueRigger (through Amazon, and though I didn't bother to rate any of their products at the time I'm tempted to go back and do so now because of the stark contrast between their products and this piece of junk), but alas even though I use their digital cables for everything from my PS3 to my PC they don't produce analog video cables, so after laughing at the $20-40 pricing of other Wii component cables I grabbed this one. Before I go on let me admit that I didn't actually read any of the reviews for this product before purchasing it. I had spent a lot of time researching my other purchases on the day I made this one, and I use a weird multi-system unbranded S-Video cable I bought from an import company that's now defunct with my Gamecube (and Sega Dreamcast...), so trusting in the discretion of the greater Amazon community I merely glanced at this item's 4+ star rating before grabbing it. If this admission causes you to write my opinion off then so be it since sitting here I can only mock my own indiscretion. As to why I'm so down on this product, in its mild defense it not only worked as flawlessly as a component cable can at first, mine still technically functions now. The worthless thing just doesn't transmit its red signal anymore, after a mere two days of use. In what I can now look back on as what I got for the ~$4 I spent on it, when the cable started malfunctioning my first thought was actually that I'd spontaneously gone colorblind, so the realization that it was just the cable's fault came as such a relief I burst into laughter at my all around folly. As to why I've bothered to write this review, my first thought upon realizing its failure was to exchange the cable, but after finally reading some of the reviews for this product I've decided not to waste any more time with it. To summarize this product and my overall experience with it I again return to ""argh,"" but if you're looking for some advice mine is to steer clear of this trash and just keep using the composite cable that comes with the Wii instead of spending $20-40 on one from Nintendo or Monster. I'm assuming that if you're even considering this item then you're not at liberty to drop that kind of money in the first place so I won't go into the old ""if money isn't an object"" spiel, but frankly even when this cable was working properly for me it's not like the difference between composite and component has much of an effect on one's experience with the Wii anyway.",negative

"The other reviews of the Nokia 6555 do an excellent job of summing up the problems that come with this phone; however, my frustration with this product is so intense that I feel compelled to repeat what has been written above. My phone is about 8 months old and here are the problems. 1) Drops calls (this could be a network issue and not a phone issue) 2) Powers off in mid conversation (definitely a phone problem) 3) Places a call, but nothing happens. The screen says, ""Calling,"" but nothing happens. This lasts about 40 seconds before the phone turns off. 4) Does not go to ""sleep"" mode (the outer display remains lit draining the battery) 5) Does not hold a charge longer than 18 hours (my old Samsung phone could go 4 days without recharging) 6) Has 3 (and counting) power off buttons. By this I mean that in addition to the official power button, the 7 key and the 1 key when pressed also turn off the phone. Trying to delete voice mail messages (with the 7 key) is infuriating. 7) Text templates can not be deleted. Some people use these cookie cutter messages, but I don't. I'd like to delete them (particularly the ones with punctuation errors), but I can't. I could go on and on, but the point is: I do not recommend this phone.",negative
"This headset is truly nothing special. I've used it for just over a month, and the unit does not keep its charge for the stated time. 45 minutes is the approximate time I've experienced. Additionally, the distance range from phone to bluetooth is far from perfect. If you leave your phone in another room, or the signal must pass through walls, the other party on the phone cannot hear you, and the phone states ""Bluetooth Signal Weak."" However, when the unit is charged, and when there is not a far distance between the unit and the phone, the reception is very good. Generally, I can hear other party very clearly, and they can hear me. The volume can be adjusted very high, which is nice when there is background noise. The design of how the unit hooks on the ear has much to be desired. You cannot really adjust the headset very well, as the earhook only moves in one direction -- that is, it swivels to allow use of either ear. Overall, I am certainly not thrilled with the product. I wish I had put the money toward another, better unit.",negative

"Beautiful, stylish, sleek phone. It's mis-marketed as a high-end phone, however. The camera is wonderful and the 2 music players superb. It's an American media phone. That is, heavy on the music & games, but not so great on the Internet. Motorola should've placed an operating system on this puppy. Nevertheless, the memory card is priceless. American carriers have found that Americans are willing to pay $20-30 MORE per month for a PDA so they needn't offer smartphones anymore. So, all of the so-called 'high-end,' non PDA phones are only high-end in the media department. The thing is, T-Mobile offers unlimited web browsing for a flat fee which makes smartphones a better buy than PDAs. High-end phones are media-rich and net-rich. This phone is only the former and, at that, has no FM radio. This is one of T-Mobile high-end offers, but isn't quite high-end. Anyone who wants a phone which is high-end in the media and Internet fields, but doesn't want to pay $20 extra for a QWERTY keyboard should stick w/ T-Mobile and purchase an unlocked smartphone from AMAZON. It won't come w/ an American service plan because Americans are forced to pay the extra monthly fee for PDAs, but you can do everything a PDA-er can, sans the keyboard. In fact, the Nokia N80 does tons more than ANY PDA on the market right now.... but it's 360 bones. This is a great phone for teens... stylish folks who want good reception and media. If you want this plus slammin' web and MS Office offerings, I'd opt for buying a smartphone. PDAs are a rip-off.",neutral

No, I do not have an extreme size melon. I have other headphones using the same ""back of the head"" support that I love. I suspect the main cause is the weight. They feel fine for about 15 minutes, then it shifts to ""head in a closing vise"" mode, with the added bonus of feeling as if my ears are being slowly sheered off my head. I keep bending the support band in hopes of finding a sweet spot...no luck yet. I guess my next approach will be padding...then a complete re-engineering of the support. Having said that, maybe they are the perfect fit for someone else's head. That lucky person would probably give them five stars.",negative

"I really liked my Otterbox Defender case but wanted something less bulky. I feel this case provides the protection I need but lacks refinement.

"What I LIKE about the phone: -The phone camera is actually great and takes beautiful pictures with giant resolution, although not as good as a 5mp camera (still pretty good), the video is also great with almost dvd quality. -The software is nice, easy to handle and allows you to install many applications available for the symbian operating system, I've installed msn messenger, skype, youtube and google maps. -The call quality is great. -The gps works great with the included maps application and even better with google maps. What I DONT LIKE about the phone: -After a week or two of use the slider becomes loose! and when you press a key the screen wobbles... This is a defect ALL the n95s have, and for some reason they haven't fixed, my family and friends who bought it are having the same problem... a real pain in the ***. -You have to recharge the battery every day. In conclusion: if you're looking for an expensive phone with a lot of features and are willing to put up with the loose slider problem then buy it...

"This phone was troublesome in that it does not hold a charge as long as the previous version. I have to charge it every night. I have also experienced some dropped calls. The predictive texting is also annoying and time-consuming. If you click on the letter 'A', you may find that it puts you at several letters beyond 'A' and you have to arrow over to the 'A' and select it. You then have to fight multiple options of predictive texting and select each letter at a time among many, by arrowing over to get the predictive text that is pertinent. I have been unable to find out how to turn off the predictive texting because the manual does not mention doing that. On top of that, this phone's keypad lettering is in Russian letters in a very small font, with the English lettering below, and very hard to read in such small print. It takes forever to send a simple 6-word text. I have told people not to text me anymore, which is unfortunate because it was such a time-saver for me in the past.",neutral
"This can slightly boost your cell signal in your residence, but only if you stay within about six feet of the tiny antenna they supply with this expensive kit. The signal drops quickly and significantly as you move away from the antenna.

This is a very nice looking case and the Droid X fits nicely in it. As another reviewer stated you have to modify it some so you can attach a charging cable to it. That's not so bad. But the clip that installs on the case does not stay on securely and if you are getting out of your vehicle or up from a chair the seat belt or chair arm will pop the case right off the clip. Luckily the case protects it well enough but I still don't like it coming off that easy.,neutral
"The main problem I have with this mount is that it is too limited on movement with the ball and socket design. Each joint has a maximum of 22.5 degrees of angle. Since my windshield has an inside angle of 40 degrees (dash to windshield) I had to install the extension joint and move it higher on the windshield to clear the dashboard. But then it is too high and in my driving view. Also with the extension it sticks out too far which also made it less stable causing it to vibrate while driving. One other complaint I have is that the joints are large and bulky making it an unsightly mount. The one positive is that the suction cup design seemed to work well, screwing the base pulls the center of the suction cup inward. For vehicles with windshields that are less sloped, this item maybe usable but I recommend to check you windshield angle before purchasing. If my inside windshield angle was over 55-60 degrees this may have worked.",negative
Don't know if I got a bad one or not but the new bat lasted 1day on a full chg. Or ten min of talk time. Not both. Tried discharging and recharging several times. Battery never had any capacity.

This Bluetooth set is pretty good. It does well in connecting to my HTC DNA phone. The only problem I have with this Bluetooth set is that the sound is pretty tinny.

"I have long been a fan of Motorola phones, but had been hesitant to buy one as their software had been lacking. However, after using various different products (Nokia, LG, and Siemens) I came back to Motorola for the price and features.

The sound quality is also excellent, and there's a built in mp3 player i'm still trying to work out how to fix. The only downside to the phone is that all numbers from my old phone are stored in the SIM card, and in order to use many of the features involving placing or recieving calls the numbers must be transferred to the phone memory, thus taking up more of it.",positive
The buds work good. The issue I have is that I wanted them to listen to music on my computer without having to be connected to it by a wire. I usually use my iPhone earbuds and was expecting the sound to be similar. I was disappointed to hear a very faint buds and no base whatsoever. I guess they will work for answering calls on your phone but they are definitively not good for listening to music.,neutral

"This battery does not disappoint. I have very few complaints as well about this battery. I liked the versatility with a flashlight, laser pointer, and an external battery. I would have liked an easier way to access what you want. While it says in the manual how to access each of the lights or the battery, it does not work perfectly. The laser pointer works the best because its just a touch of the button. The LED light is the worst because you have to turn on the battery itself before you turn on the light. It just makes for a difficult and confusing experience. Maybe providing two buttons (one for the battery on/off, the other for the lights). This would just make for a better experience with the battery/light. The idea is great and I love it because it hits a large market for people who present with a laser pointer and travel. I also really like the design is great. To make it better (and anything better) I would try to make it thinner. I really like the way it fits in hand. FInally, the LED lights are spot on and work like they should. But one problem I just ran into is that I had 2 LED light is like your last 20% percent. When my battery hit 1 LED, the charger shut off. While I charged my iPhone 2 times from 30% and another iPhone from 27%-57%, I still would have liked to have more knowledge of how much battery I have left. With that being said, the battery still works perfectly and I love it. The fact that it comes with a pouch and other cords is great for the owner of the battery. Pros - battery life and how fast it charges - accessories (pouch and cords) - design - versatility Cons - misleading battery life - confusing button to turn things on After talking to a representative over email, he sent me this: The instruction on the manual definitely needs to be revised because the actual number of seconds in holding the power button for activating each mode is quite crucial. Here are the actual instruction(tested): Laser pointer on/off: one press of the power button Battery on/off: 3 second hold of the power button(letting go of power button at 3 second will turn off battery) LED flashlight: 5 second hold of the power button(in the process of turning on flashlight it does seems to turn on battery as well though) Also, from manual the blue LED indicator should be displayed as follow: 1st LED: ""in use"" when plugged into your desire device & detects a charge 2nd - 4th LED: ""low, med, & high"" power capacity Hopefully this will clear up any confusion with the product for your future reference.

Positives - Light - Stylish - Hight capacity - bonus features (laser pointer & flashlight) - nice soft carrying case Things that could improve - They should change how button presses operate.

I've owned this cell for about 9 months so far. In that time I've exchanged it 4 times. The first 3 had to be exchanged for software issues. The 4th time something wacky happened when I used it with my iBook and I did not disconnect it properly. I went back and Verizon gave me a refurbished model (like the other 3 times). This cell will not do any file transfering by BT so that is a huge downfall. Its almost useless. Since this was the only Verizon BT cell I bought it. But in the end i wish I did not. The cell got a huge hype and it was all for nothing. Camera is useless as it takes sub-par pics. I've seen Samsung's do better than this. The screen however is nice and crisp. I also noticed that the cell scuffs really bad at the high points (where it opens/closes) but there is nothing you can do about that since you gotta open and close it.

I called tech support several times, explaining the sequence and asking what it meant. They only told me to be sure there was sufficient height distance between the antenna and the base unit, which I did but to no avail. I was not impressed with tech support. For the amount of money the unit cost, I expected more help. Regardless, I tried everything the manual suggested and several ideas of my own, including taking the unit to a two story house several blocks away and installing it there. In every situation, the unit gave the same odd sequence. Perhaps it was just a faulty unit but it would have been nice if tech would have been able to tell me that. I finally returned it for a refund (that was good) but still have lousy cell phone reeception (that is bad).",negative
"I used this product with all combinations of connections and it seemed to work fine. Unfortunately in New Zealand it simply went dead (but hotel had an adaptor I could use - thank goodness!). I don't think I used it excessively or did anything that damaged it.

"I have made fun of the two people that own this headset for the past year and a half for the sheer size of the headset, but I take those back now for sure. I have been using the headset for the past couple of weeks and it is surprisingly light and very comfortable. The weight is light, it is easy to switch ears and the sound is great. People tell me that they can't tell I am using a headset and that is important for my job. I still don't like the fact that it is so big, but I will accept it because everything else is good. I have used the voyage 520 and now the 510 and I would recommend either one.",positive
"I got my H700 from the Cingular store. The user experience is pretty good - call volume is reasonable and you can hear the caller pretty well. On big reason for the good sound is that the headset only presents the caller's side of the conversation; nothing from your side of the call is fed back through the headset's ear speaker. The experience for the person on the other end is not so good. The microphone is very sensitive - background noise can be heard just as well as the person speaking onto the headset. Using the H700 outside in wind also creates unwanted noise. The Bluetooth link is somewhat susceptible to interference, resulting in static. Of course, the person actually wearing the headset can't hear any of these problems. Overall, the H700 is great inside in a quite environment. I use mine at my desk and it works great. The convenience of the headset tempts one to use it on the go - but because of the reasons above I use the phone itself for calls of any importance in airports, the grocery store, walking the dog, etc.",neutral
"This is my first Motorola phone, and I am very disappoint with its unfriendly user interface. My old Nokia 6101 has a better, smarter, and simpler user interface compare to this new phone. Also, unlike my old Nokia phone, it comes with headset, charger, and usb connector which are made with cheap, low quality material. It really should include a better quality bluetooth headset with a $500+ listing price. Amazon has over priced this locked phone.",neutral

"At least I got all the pieces to this one, as the last one I got was missing the antenna and I had to ship it back. I set this up in my office, and got the green LED, acknowledging the unit was powered up. Put my LG G4 in the cradle and saw no change in the reception bars. Pulled up the dB meter in the phone setting and after several rounds of testing determined that the booster was having no effect at all , a 0dB gain in signal strength under any conditions. Just to make sure the booster was defective, I brought in an older Wilson Electronics Sleek that I have been using successfully in my home for a few years now. I used the weBoost antenna with the older cradle and it worked great, 8-12dB of gain without even fussing with it. I also noted that this thing got very warm, almost hot. My older Wilson Electronics Sleek has never been anything but room temperature . I was already a bit leery when I saw the company had changed its name, as this rarely if ever spells an improved product from any entity. Unfortunately my suspicions are confirmed, and what was once one of the best products I ever bought (I have 3 WIlsons) , the quality of these weBoost units seems to have declined severely. I'm returning this one for a refund, not a replacement.",negative
"Just got this little LG, and here are my thoughts. -Very clear voice calls -Great speaker and the people on the other end can't tell I'm on the speaker while I am driving -The touch screen is really bright,and pictures show great -Getting used to the touch screen, but the feedback feature is really handy for me -Reception so far has been great, only one lost call in an area that I know is a deadspot -Didn't think I'd care for the TV feature, but it is very cool, and great for killing time at airports and while visiting my mom who doesn't have a tv in the spare rooms. The screen is really sharp and the picture really shows well, even if a bit small. Like I said, so far, so good...the only negatives are: the world time doesn't adjust automatically when I reach a foreign country and as a result I can't use the phone as my alarm clock abroad (that is a very useful feature on a lot of phones), I also cannot use my recordings from my music downloads or voice recordings as my ringtones, and last but not least is that there is no flash on the camera (but I knew that before I got the phone). Overall, I am very satisfied with it as a phone, which is why I NEED it. All the extra stuff, to me is just that...extra. This may keep me as an AT&T customer.",neutral

Great feature. * QWERTY keyboard is great for text messages. * Music player sucks. No equalizer option! * Battery Life is almost non-existent. Like one of the reviews, if you see one bar of battery left, it means that the phone will start beeping low battery in 2 mins and shutdown is T-5 minutes. * The screen is dull & unreadable in sunlight.

"This product was recommended to me by a sound engineer. He liked it over some of the more expensive ""top of the line"" bluetooths which he had purchased after it was recommended to him.

I liked it not only for the sound quality but also that it stayed in my ear the best more then the kind the just hangs on your ear.

"I was hoping this would be a good phone. I had a MotoROKR and loved it. This phone was based off a similar design so I though it'd be a good fit. THE BAD * The phone came in a different language. I think French. It took me about 4 minutes to get it from French to English. During that time I noticed the phone was slow. Normally about a 1.5 second delay from the time I pressed the the middle select button til the time the screen changed. Not a good sign * Once I finally got the phone on English, I realized I had no service. Imagine that. I got service with my old phone. I get 3G service with my iPad. This phone's antennae could not get even 1 bar. * The camera: I know phones don't have amazing cameras. My ROKR was pretty decent. This poor phone's was mediocre. No pictures looked good unless it was taken in direct sunlight And that was the extent of my use. I can't have a phone that doesn't work. THE GOOD Well, even though I used the phone for 10 minutes I did like some features of the phone. * The LCD screen was nice, vibrant, and was not easily washed out by the sunlight. I went outside to see if I could get a signal; even in sunlight, the screen was still visible. Motorola did a good job with this screen * The buttons on the phone were big and easy to press. The phone is a big phone. Not quite as wide as the iPhone but about about 3/4"" shy of that. * I like the menu layout. Very intuitive. The pictures match exactly what you think they do. Hence, it was easy to navigate in French I'm not sure if this phone is a good phone or not. Were my ROKR got very little signal, this phone got none. Where my ROKR was fast, this phone lagged. I've seen other reviews saying this phone is slow to navigate, I can confirm this. While 1.5 seconds isn't dire, its not that good either. My ROKR had 2GB of music on it, I used it as my camera, and the photos came out very well for a mobile phone. This phone could do neither. The camera had trouble focusing on anything unless it was in bright sunlight. Overall, I'd say go with a different phone.",negative

"I had the original Jawbone and loved it. Becuase I used it l2hrs a day, it fell apart after a couple years. I got the new one and was impressed with the new desing. This is a huge benefit because of how cool it looks, but mainly because of weight. These are the improvements. The drawback: The noise cancellation is nothing like it used to be. I thought mine might be defected, but after I used it for about six months it died so I got a chance to check if it was just that one. It wasn't. The new one I got had stiff buttons, the same bad noise cancellation, and a quiter volume. Don't buy this. I have heard good things about the ICON. We'll see.",negative
"What I like about the phone: It is very slim and lightweight and doesn't make a large bulge in my pocket like my last phone. I sometimes forget that it's even in my pocket. The design is nice and stylish too. What I don't like about the phone: The phone is slow when navigating thru menus. It also creates a long (1 second) tone whenever the first button is pushed when making a call or when already in a call. I think this is due to the same reason that makes it slow to navigate. It's like it gets hung up on a command for a short time. It could use a faster processor or whatever it is that cell phones use. It's more annoying than anything, and cuts out the audio when the 1 second tone is sounding. i actually sent back the first one beacuse of this, but the replacement still did the same thing. The phone is simple and just does the basics. The screen is color, but not as high resolution as some fancier phones. But that's all I need right now so it works ok for me. I haven't had any problems with volume like other reviewers, it's loud enough for me.",neutral

"Excellent product, this is my second purchase I have put this to a stressful test. I weld for a living and am under a constant shower of debris. These are rugged, light weight and the quality of the sound is superb. As an added bonus they have 3 preset equalizer settings, but without any way to distinguish which is which; only the 'beep' is heard when switching. My biggest issue is that the length of the flat cables are maybe an inch short, so if you have to turn your head too far you end up pulling on the cable where it connects to the neck piece which is likely the most fragile point of the whole thing. The thick rubber elastics holding the cable to the device broke on my first pair, after continued stress eventually the sound died in one side... although this was after a year of almost daily use for 10 hours at a time. The battery life is better than advertised. I work 10 hour shifts and I usually have to let the device continue to run for another hour or two (depending on standby time) to drain the battery completely before charging. Range is surprising when signal can get through. At work I can be over 100ft from my phone (obstructed by a lot of aluminum and steel) and still experience no lag, no difficulty controlling the track or play/pause features. At home however I have difficulty when i'm 30ft down the hall getting almost any signal; pesky walls. Could use a 'previous track' button and more support around the flat cables connecting points. I do plan to buy another pair in the future as this is still a very solid product.",positive

"If you don't do a lot of talking this is a good phone, because its very comfortable in your pocket because its the smallest flip phone out there.

"I am pleased with the sound quality of the device. Volume level is adequate even when on noisy roads and people on the other end have actually remarked positively about the level of quality. I only wish the Jawbone engineers had stopped tinkering when they perfected the audio quality and not designed a fit system so complicated and brittle that it impairs my ability to actually use the device. The ear loop has about the consistency (and strength) of a paper clip. The result is something so flimsy that Jawbone Inc. considers earloops to be a consumable. After receiving the Jawbone as a gift this holiday season I was unable to use it as all of the included earloops snapped off within the first day of use. Needless to say I didn't start using the product until about February after waiting for customer service to send me replacements. Any future earloops, they tell me, will have to be purchased for $2.50 each! The sound is great but like others on here the fit leaves something to be desired. This after trying the infinite combinations of earloops and earbuds the unit comes with. Turning my head quickly often requires a readjustment even with the tightest fitting earloop. I realize that all ears are different but I've had cheap headsets that fit great because the engineers did not try to over-engineer the fit process. I am sure there are other great sounding bluetooth devices in this price range that are better constructed and will provide less aggravation. It's for that reason I can't recommend this product since its construction makes it completely unreliable.",negative
"I started with a Nokia bluetooth earpiece that was awful. I could hardly hear the people on the phone at all. Moving to this device was certainly an improvement over that. All in all it was a nice looking unit and the battery does last forever. When it does finaly get low, there is an audable beep that lets you know that it is time for a recharge. You know it is charging because the blue light comes on and stays on until it is fully charged. It could be quite startling when using the earpiece in a car at night as the blue flashing light reflecting off of the glass was exactly the same color as a police car light! I learned quickly to open the mic and put the unit on while pushing the button to answer a call. It is quick and fairly easy to put on with some practice. However it does flop around if you turn your head, and if you wear glasses it becomes signifigantly more uncomfortable. The biggest drawbacks for me are the difficulty hearing callers. I have exceptional hearing, and I am constantly wishing I could turn up the volume. Also people who call me often complaied of static. I wore the headset on my left ear, and I found I had to have the phone on a desk in front of me, or on my belt right over my left front pocket of my pants. If I wore it on my right hip, or even on my left hip under my arm. My own body was enough to block the signal. I had to have line-of-sight between the phone and the earpiece. About once per week, the headset and my phone (Treo 650) would mysteriously uncouple and I would need to mate them again. and the last straw was when the microphone on the headset quit working just as the warranty ended. I can still use the headset to listen to voicemail, but that just isn't good enough.",neutral
"This headset works GREAT and was perfect for the money BUT..... the part that goes onto the ear to hold it in place fell apart in less than a month of minimal use.

"I bought the Jabra for the express purpose of using it while my phone was 15-20 feet away on my desk. I experienced heavy static from that distance (despite an advertised 30 foot range). Also, when the side of my head with the Jabra on it was facing the phone, I got better reception than when I turned away. I am, apparently, thick headed. Using the Jabra in the car was an awesome experience, since the phone was so close to me. There were no wires to interfere with my driving, and I could answer calls easily with the Jabra itself, never even touching the phone. But $80 is too much to pay for wireless convenience in a car. Until the technology improves or price drops, the Jabra is just not as vaulable as a simple wired handsfree device. I returned my Jabra after one week.",negative

"I'm glad I waited awhile to write this review, because when I first got this phone, I loved it (I should note that I'm already on my second one as the first one stopped working, and was covered under warranty). The music player is fun, and the camera takes good pictures (the flash is a helpful feature). But, as time goes on, this phone really wears out - and fast. The power/end call button stopped working altogether on my first one, and the select (circle) button fell off. The power button was a warranty issue, so I had to pay $10 (S&H) and got a new phone. Well, six months into the second one, I had the same issue w/ the select button. This is a well known defect with this phone, as I learned when I went into the T-Mobile store, but it is not covered under warranty. Then, about 3 months after that, the entire larger circle that contains the up/down/left/right arrows fell off.

"I was very enthusiastic about this headset based on friends' recommendations and some reviews, but it was a huge disappointment. Apparently I got one with the defect where it kept slipping out of the charging tube. (That's one truly bizarre design.) It could not be charged. I contacted Plantronics and they agreed to ship a replacement (very good customer service, by the way). The second one fit better in the charger, but still fails to make contact 1 out of 5 or 6 times. Even when charged, the headset is hard to use. When in my ear, the join between the earpiece and main body is floppy and the headset flops down to an unusable angle. The controls and flashing-light sequences are hard to understand and follow. And to top things off, the Bluetooth performance with my Treo 700p is unacceptable (I can't even put it in the pocket of my jogging shorts without static, for example).

The headset works wonderfully. I just turned it on and found it on my phone and now everytime i turn it on it auto connects. I can start music and make calls all with the headset. Something that i found to be interesting is that when in calls the sound comes through both earbuds. The only thing that i don't like about it is that it has a delay when i hook it up to my laptop but that isn't a problem because listening to music who cares and i didn't get it for my laptop. Also it might be the settings on my laptop making it lag like it does. I would recommend this headset to anyone and if you don't need stereo then u should atleast get the 815 mono version of this headset. Allot of people were complaing about the buttons being hard to push or the slide part being hard but i have no problem with it. I will agree that if i push the call button on it it does go into my ear canal but i learned and now i just hold the side with my thumb and middle finger so it doesnt. Another thing that people were complaing about was the sound volume but mine gets plenty loud i mean if you were listening to it in a very loud enviorment then you could hear that a little over the music but i used it at a party and i could hear just fine so i think that it gets loud enough. The range on it is awesome because i can leave my phone in my room upstairs and go anywhere in my house and it will still work.,positive

"I'm using this charging caddy for my 2 phones (Samsung Galaxy S4 and iPhone 6s), MP3 player, keys, and wallet. To go along with this caddy, I purchased a USB charging hub that hides in the base of this charging caddy, and also a switch for the AC outlet, so it is only drawing power and charging at night when I need to charge the phones. Overall, I like the caddy and it works fine for keeping things organized and concealing all the cords. However, I think the width of the phone dividers needs to be updated to fit more currents phones. Many smartphones in 2016 now have 5.0"" screens, or larger. As you can see in the picture, the iPhone 6 (4.7"" screen) with a case barely fits in the end divider. The Galaxy S4 (5.0"" screen) will definitely not fit in the end divider section.",positive

"...And that is to not have to hold your phone any more. Audio quality is low, clip, as other readers have said, really IS junk - it fell off literally in the first 20 minutes of talking just from having it push against my shirt. It didn't damage the cable or anything; but I think that's just because it wasn't attached like at ALL when it fell off. Couldn't get it back on either because they give you about 20 pages of warranty information in 40 different languages but nothing else. Audio quality = sounding like you're speaking underwater. The ear bud itself is, as others have said, huge = I'm a pretty big guy, but this thing is about 3/4 inches in diameter. To make matters worse, mine at least did not even come with a simple foam cover for the earbud, meaning that when you're trying to get this huge bud shoved into your ear canal, it really HURTS as you're trying to do it without any kind of soft foam to protect you. However, it's pretty cheap and USB. That's what I saw when I bought it 5 days ago. Make your own decision, but I think that now if I found literally ANY other kind of USB headset that would work with a RAZR, I'd take it.",negative

These batteries are supposed to be new, but the power seems to drain rather quickly and they need to be charged every night and sometimes once in the afternoon if I've been using it a lot. I guess they are ok for the price but next time I will invest the $30 at the Verizon store and buy a truly 'new' one.",neutral

"This seems like a no-brainer good idea to protect the headset. However, the case is floppy enough that it catches on doors, car doors, tables, chairs, etc. Additionally, the velcro is very weak.

"I work for a company that sells refurbished phones and cell accessories and this particular item is a huge bestseller. The other day we got about 1,000 of these in and within 24 hrs, all but 2 were sold. We got more in and they also sold out. Recently, my father wanted one and my boss gave it to him as a gift and at $90 in the store, it was very generous of him to do so. My dad loves this though. He likes that it's not cheap and fits comfortably on his ear. We have since gotten Blue Ant's other models and while they aren't selling as quickly as this one, they are still a hot item but the VX1 gets my vote for it's pretty design (I like the ant picture) and for being small. It is one of the nicestest bluetooths I've ever seen and before I started working here, I never heard of Blue Ant. But Blue Ant gets my vote for innovation and creativity and a product that works very well and this is coming from someone who isn't a big fan of Bluetooth's to begin with.",positive

"When I bought Mobile XT for my HP iPAQ 910 (running WM 6.1), I already had been shopping for a GPS for my car for some time. The list of features for this smartphone-based navigation system seemed to cover what I needed, and the price was certainly attractive. So, I ordered one without any delusions that it would be as good as a dedicated unit like a Nuvi. But, I have been pleasantly surprised. Just for the heck of it, I stuck the micro-SD card in my phone while I was sitting in the parking lot of the Post Office after picking up the package from Garmin, and within 3 minutes, the software was installed, the unit was tracking on 6 satellites, and my phone was telling me how to get to the service station with the cheapest gasoline in town. I wish the screen was easier to read (a problem display size on my phone, not with the software), that I could copy the software to my 8GB micro-SD, that the voice directions included street names, but I have a very functional navigation system at a very reasonable price.

"I got the Motorala RAZR for christmas when I already had an LG that did everything right. Perhaps that is why i'm bitter. Below is a list of things that are irritating about the RAZR. They may be small but it's the small things that I use most often. 1: ....Delay.... There is significant delay for almost every function. Press phone book... wait... press f... wait... call friend. This is the function that is used most often and yet there is about a half second delay after each button is pressed. I'm used to a near instant response from LG phones and older motorolas. This delay is on everything that refreshes the display. I can't stress enough how annoying this is. 2: Max volume is too soft. For example, I was sitting in a department store with the volume of this phone at its maximum and had much trouble hearing what my friend was saying. I had to ask him to repeat himself so many times that we eventually just ended the conversation because it was taking to long to communicate. This happens in most public places and in the car. It's not that you can't hear the person. It's just that it takes too much strain to understand the words that are contaminated with the background noise in these everyday situations. I never had this problem with my previous phone. 3: Alarm Clock interface is poor. This may seem like too small of function to be complaining about but it is common for people to use their cell phone as their daily alarm clock. If you have a regular 9-5 job and don't need to change the times of your alarm the RAZR works okay. Note that there is no Mon-Fri enable option so you will have to remember to enable it every night. If you are a student or if you have irregular work hours this alarm clock is even more annoying. They have you name the alarms rather than just displaying what time the alarm will go off. That way, if you're unsure what time the alarm goes off, you've got to go through some 2 delayed button functions to just see the time. This is just something that really irritates me. If you're used to better, it will irritate you too. 4: Volume button on monitor end of phone rather than the button end, probably because the buttons wouldn't fit there with such a slim design. Just hold one of these phones open in your hand and try to adjust the headset volume as you would during a call. It's an awkward and slow process. The good thing is that the earpiece is so quiet that you could just keep it at full volume for almost any use. It looks cool though. But everybody has one now anyway.",negative

"This unit only works well when it's two feet away and line-of sight of my V551. Forget about putting the phone in your pants pocket or on your hip (even on the same side of the body as the headset). After calling Jabra customer service and being assured that the unit should work as I was applying it, I exchanged it for a new one from Amazon. Of course, customer service isn't going to tell you that they have a mediocre design... I returned the second one last week in excange for a Motorola HS850. In the end, cool physical design, poor electronic design!",negative
"This is a great phone in terms of reception. There are some design flaws. If carrying the phone in a bag, it is easy to inadvertently hit the record button or to lower the sound of the ringer. There are limited ringers that come with the phone and it is difficult if not impossible to download ringers without buying Verizon's Get It Now package or hacking into the phone. The camera is USELESS for indoor shots. The Bluetooth feature is only useful for a headset. Verizon has made it impossible to sync it with your computer. It is a nice looking phone if a bit long. The keyboard is odd. You can list multiple numbers for each entry, and that's a plus.",neutral

"Pros: * Nice stereo audio quality * Comfortable. (This might not be true if you have thick-framed glasses.) * Inconspicuous, no big blue lights flashing on the side of your head. From the front, it's hard to tell that you're wearing headphones without looking closely. * Some features work as promised, pauses when answering phone call, music resumes after hanging up. Cons: * Handsfree function: The handsfree microphone is in the right ear and not very clear, the handset audio is left ear only. In wind it is useless; in a noisy environment, it is very poor. In a quiet environment, it is usable. Don't get it if you want a good voice headset. * The buttons for forward and backward are very sensitive on my unit. This is a problem because the play/pause button is smack dab between them and they are all so small that you have to feel around to orient you finger to find any of them. If I'm not *very careful*, I'll hit backward or forward in the process and lose my place. This poses a real problem with audio books. * If the music transmitter device is in my front pants pockets, the signal constantly starts and stops. This was really bad with the Jabra A125s iPod adapter, and merely unacceptable streaming from a BlackBerry 8330 Curve. If the transmitter is carried in a backpack, it hardly cuts out at all. Maybe it's all the iron in my blood, but it doesn't seem to travel well through my person. I tried my back pants pockets and still no better. * Battery life needs work. You can't use this if you listen to music all day. * I keep having to re-pair it every time I turn it on. Maybe it's because I hop around between 3-4 devices so often, but it is supposed to keep pairings for 8 devices. Still haven't figured this out. Summary: I give it 2 stars for good audio quality when the signal stays connected.",negative
"I got the Z9 earlier this year. I did a lot of research and it appeared to be the best one out there at any price. The performance has seemed to be good, battery life is good, it's light, small and about as comfortable, even without the ear hook, and aesthetic as you can get for something stuck in your ear. The sound quality on my end has always been good (after the firmware upgrade) and seldom did I ever have to use the higher level of noise cancellation. Updating the firmware was a real pain, but was worth it in terms of performance improvement, and it beats having to buying a new headset every couple of months like most other BT headsets. Now fast forward 4-5 months. The earpiece has a rubber cushion that disintegrates after 3-5 months of occasional use. the thing cust falls out of your ear now. I checked some other review sights and it seems to be a common problem. When I checked BlueAnts web site trying to find replacements, I found that they wanted $10.00 plus shipping each! Every 3-5 months? But no worry, I can save my money because they have been out of stock for months and have no idea when they (BlueAnt) will get more in. The also say that the earpiece is not under the warranty, even though the the warranty does not exclude it. A reputable company would recall a clearly defective unit, or at least offer free or reduced priced replacement parts until a proper fix is worked out. These guys take it as an opportunity for another profit stream. If you really like the electronics, I heard that some of the Jabra eargel configurations may work on the Z9. [...]",neutral

"First how it compares to my previous phone, a Motorola Razr: this LG phone is metal and thus sturdier. The LG port where you attach a charger has a cover over it so it doesn't get damaged by water, dirt, etc. I had problems with the uncovered port on the Razr. On the Razr it was very easy to accidentally hit the side buttons and thus change settings without even knowing it. The LG also has side buttons but they aren't as easy to accidentally depress. So far this thing holds a charge much longer than my Razr did but the Razr battery declined continually, despite my doing the recommended full run down and full recharge periodically. I hope this phone's battery continues to outperform the Razr. The numbers on the screen are big and that is very helpful as our baby boomer generation ages and starts needing eye glasses. My one concern is the heat generated by the battery. The battery can get pretty hot if I talk for 30 minutes or more. I'm concerned about what effect this might have on the battery's life. Overall I'm happy, this phones seems much better made than the Razr it replaced.",neutral
These items did not last more than five days each. I would never recommend these to anyone. I have since changed phones because of the track balls. Another reason is that the Blackberry that I had froze up all of the time and rendered it pretty much useless.,negative
"Palm - 700w - Verizon Model I've been using this PALM TREO for a couple months now and would recommended to others... look very hard at this phone and rationalize why you want it before stepping forward. The hardware in itself seems very solid and reliable. This TREO package has several great items. And if you're looking at it to use Microsoft Mobile and the Palm calendar function, to Sync to Outlook and staying current on appointments and events. These features of pretty solid. Battery life and performance is pretty good. If you're a RIM or Blackberry user the Keyboard is a snap and easy to use. The pointer stick keypad is a nice feature too... The display is fair and you can see it in most lighting situations other then direct sunlight. Be sure to buy screen protective covers.... And a couple of the programs I've purchased to run on MS mobile work well, as long as you only run one at a time. Speakerphone works OK, but the Mic picks up all background noise. The very first thing when you get your TREO ... look for MS updates and flash the phone. My Phone was delivered direct from Verizon with an older operating release installed. Palm had posted a new release two months prior. With current updated there's still several irritants. As a long time Verizon customer I don't see these issues as their base cell phone service problems. It appears to be Palm & MS. And I would expect the same from other providers, I know of a couple Sprint users stating they're seeing the same issues. My opinion as a customer, if Verizon wants return customers I would be leveraging Palm to correct the issues or buy back or exchange these phones from their customers'. And like all items we spend our hard earned cash on! .... We tend to migrate to gravitate to the negative items. 1. Microsoft Mobile tends to work like most MS operation systems. It locks up and requires a reboots on a regular basis.. I've learned just to soft boot the device weekly to reduce the issue. Even with the most recent OS update. 2. Most of the TREO functions & options have very primitive settings and functionality. If you're used to Motorola & Blackberry phones and use the many options and phone tools, You will be disappointed! Palm is lacking this flexibility. You're forced to buy software to do some of the task you might be use too. This device has a lack of memory issue, which will cause you problems too. You can pretty much expect to be able to load about 100 addresses, phone numbers and a couple very small MS Word docs before you run out of memory. Running the application from a SD card works well until you bump the card and it ejects. You can expect the MS Mobile to crash 30% of the time. 3. I've tried several different Bluetooth ear pieces and in general the phone does a poor job in connecting and managing the devices. Sound quality is poor, did I say poor!. I've used every device Palm and Verizon has recommended. And if you get more than about 8 feet from the phone it goes out..... In addition at least once a week the Bluetooth device setting get turned off and need to be reactivated. 3. Phone connectivity is questionable. If your switching from a TRImode phone you will drop kick this phone. Dropped calls will be a part of you daily route until you re-learn the digital coverage areas. Forget about call waiting. It drops the calls and will disconnected the holding party most of the time. I used and all digital Motorola phone and it out performs this TREO phone in service connectivity.... and sound quality by a large margin. 4. Phone connections and dialing take longer and seems to have a very long pause when connecting to outgoing calls. There is also a lot of sound quality delays, sound pauses and cutting out in the middles of conversations. Unlike some phones there seems to be no noise cancellation or filtering in this device. It picks up all background noise. 5. Voice dialing.... Forget it. Not worth setting up..... Other phones are a snap and work. This one is too temperamental.... It selects the wrong names. 6. MP3 Player ....Don't expect to store MP3 on the base memory. You will be forced to use the storage card due to the memory constraint device. And as a point, the player library manager seems to repetitively default back to main memory and you can't find your music. The the MS Player has a very low sound quality, even with excellent headsets...... Expect to by a jack plug converter. The plug is smaller then those on MP3 players.. 7. WEB browsing is extremely slow and if you choose sites other than the Palm sites you can expect to wait longer. And many of the Websites do not show up correctly. Event those setup for PDA's. There is a lot of WEB(Digital) signal dead areas. I've experienced a lot of dead digital signal areas where my Laptop Verizon Digital Card has excellent signal. Must be another poor Palm software item. The phone does not multiplex well. It has problems managing the Phone, Web and PDA items if you trying to run them all at the same time. Odds this is due to the lack of base memory or slow processor. The bottom line is.... I'm not sure I would venture into the MS Mobile phones unless you know what you want to use it for. I feel this is and emerging market and still in development. And it will be a while before it becomes a great product. Time will tell. I plan to keep the TREO 700w. Because it is to late to return it! But I would take my money back and try something else if I had the chance.. One last note..... The joke commercial Verizon continues to run when they say ""Can You Hear Me Now"" .... You will be using this line a lot with this phone. It cuts out allot...",neutral

"This phone caused me problems from the first day I had it. Synching with my computer took eleven calls to tech support. Hooking up email support took three days and two visits to my office from the Altell account manager. Even though I have a nation-wide corporate plan, the phone would turn itself off when I traveled more than 50 miles from my office, and all emails would stop completely. The Bluetooth connection turns itself off randomly and sometimes required a soft re-boot (remove and reinstall the battery) just to allow me to reconnect. In just one month I had to do seven hard re-boots (remove the battery, hold down the power key while reinstalling the battery) just to unfreeze the phone. Last week I called Altell and demanded that they change me to a Blackberry at no charge. Now I have a brand new Blackberry 8703e which set up on my company's server in less than five minutes. It has never dropped a call or failed a Bluetooth connection. Don't waste your time with a Palm Treo; get a Blackberry instead.",negative

"If somebody thinks this phone to be top of the line in 2005, I won't be surprised, but if it's said in year of 2007, I can't help but laughing. Man, there are ton's of better phones out there now. This phone is just a basic phone if it's not looked as outdated. Who would like to use a phone with a technology 2 years ago, anti-intuitive menu, awkward address book and no extendable slot? Well, at first I would like a phone to be a phone, a mp3 player, a gps and a pda...That would be a pda phone like Cingular 8525 or Treo 700.

"Simply put, the sound quality of this headset is AMAZING, and everything they claim it to be on their website and advertisement. The noise canceling works impressively, and as an Electronics engineer, I really have to salute the design team behind that technology. The bad, is the horrible mechanical design of this unit. while it does ""look"" pretty slick, and very modern, the mechanisms for fitting in on one's ear, are very poorly designed. The removable ear-bud peace (which they provide more than one size to accommodate users) well, it keeps falling off... or getting stick in the ear, as the whole unit falling off. It is not secure in place AT ALL, and since I really was impressed with the sound quality, I tried over and over to find a nice fit, (finally glued that piece!). Also, the metal loop that goes over the ear, is not very convenient, and you have to choose right or left ear operation to install the proper loop.

"Very good audio reception and transmission, even in noisy areas. You have to insert an earpiece into the ear which takes getting used to but you eventually do. It does bring three earpieces and can try each one to see which one suits you best. It is a larger unit compared to a smaller bluetooth such as the Motorola HS820. The on/off button is separate from the call button and are both easily accessible. You can turn off the light that indicates the unit is on and/or in use. The unit may be used on the right or left ear. It seats relatively well on the ear and the earpiece helps it stay in place. I bought the unit for its promise of very good audio reception and transmission and it has delivered on both. Update(12/2009): Battery charge lasts for days with heavy use, longer with light use. I just bought another headset because the original I bought two years ago got washed in the washing machine and ceased functioning (so make sure not to place the headset in your pocket).",positive

"I have had this phone in NYC area for about 3 months now. My wife has Cingular (RAZR) and I was going to get that phone as well, but then saw this one available at the Cingular store and figured I would get it for the looks, and Cingular said they support the phone so I thought all would be good. After using it for 3 months, I lose service in A LOT of areas around here, and my wife's phone works fine. I guess it is b/c of all this 1900, 850, 900 band issues.

"I've owned the i730 for about 2 weeks, having bought it to ""upgrade"" the i90c I've used for over a year. The i90c was a fine phone, a bit bulky and the batter life was terrible (even with an upgraded 750mAh battery), but it's incredible call clarity and loud speakerphone was enough to make me overlook its shortcomings. So, I figured the i730 would only be better than i90c, right? Not necessarily. My biggest complaint with the i90c was battery life, and sadly, Motorola still hasn't solved the problem. The i730 is a slight improvement, but if you use the phone a lot like I do, be prepared with car chargers and backup batteries. The i90c was also bulky as it had a hump on the back to accomodate the battery. While the 730 is sleek (no hump), it still is essentially the same size and thickness as the i90. Weight is nearly identical. Call clarity with the i730 is comparable to the i90c, which is good. Speakerphone, here's my biggest complaint. With the i730, Motorola moved the speakerphone to the back of the phone (it faced the front on the i90c). This makes no sense to me. Others have said they like this design because they can hear people when the phone is clipped to their belt, but when I use the speakerphone, I generally place the phone down on a surface. As a result, the sound is muffled coming from the speakerphone. Another complaint is the location of the buttons. First, the power button is nestled between other important buttons and is not easily found in the dark (unlike the i90c). Call and end buttons are also reversed from the i90c. While I'm sure with enough use I'll get familiar with the location, the reversal of buttons from the 90/95 models has me frustrated. There are good things I like about the i730, such as the flip activation control, which allows me to place a call on speakerphone and close the phone without disconnecting. I also like the clean appearance (silver), and the blue backlight makes using it at night easy. In sum, it's a decent phone, but coming from the i90c, I expected better considering the hefty price tag.",neutral

"On of the best product , very clear and easy to use but on the long run I would get the other model without the pop up antenna on the side if your budget can afford it.

"I like the features of this phone, but its battery time is terrible, and that's the first reason why I'm rating it low. The owner's manual says it has standby time of up to 270 hours (which is 11.25 days). However, my experience is that it lasts 2 days or less, even when the phone isn't used. I wondered if it was just a bad battery, so my service provider swapped in a new battery, but it gave the same disappointing result. For me, this is a serious annoyance. My previous phone, a Motorola v-180, lasted 5 - 8 days, even when it was used a lot (under the same conditions as this Nokia). My other complaint is that, every time I use this phone, I have to carefully adjust the position of the phone against my ear in order to find the spot where the sound is clear. This has not been an issue with previous phones.",negative

I purchased this BT headset based on a friends recommendation to use with my Motorola Razor as a replacement for my Plantronics Voyager 510.

"I've tried many headsets before settling for the H700. It is small, compact, light-weight and the reception on both ends is great. It doesn't overshadow your ear when wearing it and it doesn't make you look like a robot while having it on. So many headsets make it appear as if there is a giant robotic mosquito gnawing at your ear. This is not the case. It's perfect for any ear, big or small.",positive
I bought this charger because my phone dies at work before the day is over. This very conveniently fits inside my pocket and is not uncomfortable. The laser pointer and flashlight are an added bonus that have come in use for presentations at work.

"Once we hooked it up, I could tell my phone had a couple more bars. It really did improve our cell service, but wasn't amazing like I thought it would be. My husbands phone was the worst. Since we live in the woods, he had no service at all. AFter using the booster, he was up to 2 -3 bar. So yes it does work!",neutral
"I received this product quickly in the mail and charged it right away. The sound quality is good and clear and my phone found it and synced immediately. I am a little annoyed at the short battery life, after wearing it for a day I find I have to charge it at night. Expect to charge the ear piece every day. The only other minor problem with it is that it can sometimes leave your inner ear sore from prolonged use. After a few days though, my ear got used to it. Overall I like the small size and good quality of this product. I won't be replacing it anytime soon.",neutral
"I had a good experience with a cheapo Motorola H670 headset, but it had poor range so I figured I'd bump up to the next grade, so to speak. The H710 cost twice as much, but seemed well reviewed, so I opted to grab one, and I am very seriously regretting it. The whole thing came in unsealed generic packaging, with no motorola logo or name anywhere on the outside, though it did have a manual and the earpiece has the logo. I wasn't exactly filled with confidence that this wasn't some sort of knock off (though it would certainly explain my experience). First off, the sound quality is only marginally better than the H670, but the range is equally bad - if the phone is anywhere farther than 3 feet away, the signal gets pretty bad. The microphone seems to be better, but the too-clever flip out design makes it a pain to shut off the earpiece while you're wearing it. To make matters worse, it's small, far to small for my comfort. I wear the default size earpiece for the H670, and the 710's earpiece is basically the size of the small, so it's very uncomfortable, and it offers no means of adjustment or alternate clips, so I basically had to bend the plastic to make it fit. Lastly, it uses a flattened version of the USB charger, rather than true mini-usb, so my existing chargers were rendered useless. Frustrating and disappointing. I had been really, really pleased with the bang for the buck I had gotten from Motorola's cheaper headset, and that had earned a lot of goodwill for the brand. This headset has, I'm afraid, pretty well obliterated that goodwill and sent me back to my old headset while I look for a better option.",negative
"Received my holder today and it is absolutely perfect for when I ride my horses. Now if something should happen I can always be a phone call away.

This is evidently a used OEM MOTOROLA SNN5696 BR50 RAZR V3 V3c V3m BATTERY Sold by: ElectroGems. You can see in the pictures how worn it is and it is supposed to be a NEW battery.

"I bought the Nokia 1600 from Net 10 and was VERY pleased with the Quality of the phone and Service; however, I decided to upgrade to the Motorola W375 and Whoa!!! This phone is a power hog!!! or maybe I got a crappy battery. I had noticed that the on/off button was picky and inconsistent about how long to hold it down to turn the phone on and off (usually 5 seconds to power on is normal). I noticed that the games on this phone are awesome; however, the phone's processor is not fast enough to provide smooth video to the screen during game play - the games are so fun that one seriously stresses to overlook this petty annoyance . I was also disappointed with the speed of Net 10's web access (""data services"") on this phone, it took over 10 minutes to load the default homepage. I have lots of experience with mobile devices, networks, computers, etc. and have just ventured into the world of cell phones. Cell phone technology reminds me of the palm pilot technologies, only with less flexibility for synchronization with a PC ( although this is subject to change based on the phones offered by the carrier). I did notice the USB port on the phone( it's used to charge the phone's battery). I didn't like the silicone cover for the USB port that dangles off the phone, it could be torn off with normal wear and tear. I did like the fact that Motorola offers phone tools software but, sadly, I never got a chance to fully explore the functionality of it with the W375.",neutral
"So I bought this because my old trackball decided to fall out and all the scrollers fell out as well. It's pretty cheap. We have to understand that this isn't an OEM replacement but a third party so it's not gonna be perfect. The ball feels a little gritty but it's just something you have to get use to. It will probably become smoother later on after repeated use. When I installed this into my 8120, it would barely scroll up or down. I had to spend about 5 mins getting to the settings and change the vertical sensitivity of the trackball for it to be similar to the old one. Even though it's closer to normal, it's still not that great as when I scroll up or down it tends to scroll the opposite direction at times. A little inconvenient but nonetheless it works. So if you are having problems with scrolling try setting the sensitivity first before you say it's not good.",neutral

The only negative point is the black plastic that it uses to support to your ear. It seems fragile. Always remember to be careful... In brief, I recommend this product.",positive

"I researched this headset quite a bit before I bought it and read that it is about the best bluetooth headset out there. So far, I think the headset is good but I have had some serious problems with it. I am using this headset with a Motorola Razr V3. Firstly, it loses connection for no reason about once or twice a day while the headset is on my ear and my phone in my pocket. I keep it charged so I don't think that is the problem. It's weird because I can almost walk to other side of my house away from the phone and not lose connection. Second, it does not work that well outside if there is even the slightest breeze. People say they can't hear me so I cup my hand over the headset and that seems to help. Third and most importantly, the clip that holds the gel earpiece broke yesterday and I have only had this for 37 days. I have contacted support and am waiting for a reply. I'm not saying that anyone should not buy this unit because it is a very good sounding, lightweight headset. Maybe I got a lemon?",neutral
"This product deserves five stars because it delivers what it was made for: Charge! Pros: It holds a great amount of charge; it charges fast and it comes with everything you need.

It can charge my phone up to 4-5 times before it needs to be recharged The charging chord that comes with the battery is a good length and allows me to have the Imp500 in my pocket charging my phone while I'm taking on it.

Finally speakerphone volume and mp3 volume was miserably low. I've had Motorola Q9h, BJ II, and Tilt so I'm very familiar with Windows mobile phones. All those devices were better than this HP 910.

"After moving to the US from overseas, I needed a pre-paid SIM for my iphone. The at&t go phone SIM was exactly what I needed. After reading the customer reviews, I realised that some people had difficulties activating the SIM and for others it worked well. I thought $6.00 it's worth a shot. The product arrived super fast. I was very impressed. I was sent the cell antenna and the SIM card sticky taped to it (no instructions, cell number or pin). I'm pretty good with using the internet so I found the activation site on the at&t website. The activation went well until the last stage where the data is being processed. I kept getting an error message from the at&t website ""error GP038 activation taking longer than normal. Please try again"". I tried calling the at&t customer service line but the automated messages ask for a cell number which I don't have. I contacted the seller for instructions and they were very prompt in replying and gave me a web address which took me to the site I was originally at (I was kinda hoping for more detailed instructions). After further detective work and watching ""how to"" videos on 'You Tube' I found the solution to my problem and got my SIM activated and a new cell number was issued. I think my activation difficulties were to do with at&t (their horrible website) & the fact I had an iphone. Also, worth mentioning I haven't added any credit to my phone as the at&t website doesn't take overseas credit cards. Thus if you're from overseas, the best bet may be to buy a Pay as You Go card as well.",neutral

"This product does not live up to it's marketing. Although inbound audio quality is good, outbound audio is inferior to much cheaper non-noise canceling products. The outbound audio is tinny and sometimes distorted. The earpieces designed to rest in the ear canal have been designed with too much tolerance in their interface with the base unit so when you twist them on, they easily fall off. This makes putting the device on your ear an extreme challenge. I finally had to use a small amount of adhesive to bond the earpiece to the device so it would not fall off every time I put in on my ear. This is a classic example of functional design coming up way short of very good aesthetic design. Don't bother buying this until they fix it.",negative

"I *love* my LG phones. My LG ENV 9900 is a tank and a half. We used to open bottles together back in college. I remember when I got it that I would say ""it isn't trying to be thin. This has a 5 day battery life and feels solid"". But, as the 18 months went on, my phone gradually diminished into a 1-day battery life. I also found it randomly turned off in my pocket. For awhile I thought it may have been the battery simply dying quickly, but I realized that it would really crash about 1 in 5 times i sent a text message. And then sometimes when I was in the middle of a cell phone call. I took a chance, and got this new battery. This breathed fresh life into my env! I now get 5 days battery life again, meaning I can go an entire week with light usage and only charge it on the weekends or once overnight when I remember to. It also *rarely* crashes now. ** By replacing my battery, I feel like I have a brand new phone. The seller was fast, the battery is awesome. It *is* silver, and my phone is orange, but I don't mind. Also this battery is a slightly bit larger than the stock battery, I believe. It is actually pretty awesome because as I look at my phone, I realize that the dimensions extend the battery physically in such a way that the back of the phone is flush with the camera, so there is no wobble when it sits screen-up. I think the oem battery, at least in my version, was flush to the base of the phone, not the camera lense, so there was wobble. Although I might be wrong. Thats the end of my review. For a personal backstory, read on. My wife's current alias 2 just started behaving the same way (crashing frequently when texting and when flipping the phone. It makes me wonder how many people throw out perfectly good phones just because they start crashing. I wonder how many of those phones could be fixed by replacing the battery? Her phone might actually be going bad, but many people that I've come across in forums report the same thing for the alias 2 (crashing frequently when flipping and texting) but I haven't found a verified claim of anyone trying a battery replacement (because the battery indicator is always full). With generic batteries being only $5 on the internet, the bet is worth it to me over buying a new phone and contract renewal (or pay up front for a $400 phone...). My thought is that as the battery wears down, as batteries inevitably do by their very nature, there becomes a point where the battery just isn't performing top notch to what the specifications of the system require. Depending on the quality of the components and the tolerance of the operating system, including error detection and error correcting, eventually there will become a point in time where some electronic component can't respond or charge up quick enough because of a drooping voltage, and the operating system crashes. The phone rarely crashes when it is just sitting still in idle. Usually it crashes when trying to flip on the backlight of an LED, for example. This is assuming, of course, that the regular components in the phone don't fail first. In my case, my electrical components are 3 years old but hanging in there, while my battery (which is, honestly, designed to fail before the phone is considered worthless anyways, or about 2 years with current cell phone provider plans) crapped out within specification. By replacing the battery, you're replacing a very serious bottleneck and restoring tight voltage responses to the electronics. So, if you're with me so far... is it any coincidence that the iPhones have no ability to change batteries by the user? In my opinion, it is a bold move to force the consumer into a buy cycle on apple/at&t's terms (oh, a ""battery replacement"" costs a (hypothetical) $100? Well that brand new iphone 8 is only $150, I might as well upgrade! And its about time to renew my contract anyways...) Something to think about.",positive

"When I used my ""New Every 2"" upgrade to get the new enV2, I was really excited at the form factor, the new features such as the GPS, and expanded V-Cast catalog. After 2 months, my phone stopped charging consistently, and for awhile I made the best of it. However, trying to hold the car charger into the power port while driving became not just frustrating, but dangerous. The shop class project at home to make use of the wall charger so I didn't have to stand and hold it was also a lesson in safety while using power tools. I took the phone back to my local Verizon store, was informed I had a bad USB power port, and was blessed to know that the TEC insurance I've been paying for all these months was a solid investment. I was given the same model as a replacement, and left the store. Within 24 hours, I had 12 calls, of which 6 dropped inexplicably, even with 4 bars of signal sitting in a parked car next to a cell tower. 11 days later, I returned to my local Verizon store, only to stand at Tech Support for over an hour and a half and have them call the 1-800 number for help. They allowed that my call record showed an inordinately high drop rate, and that it ""might"" be my phone. Per the manager, this left me with one option and one only - take a new model of the same phone. I no sooner got the ""new"" phone into the car, which by the way was uncharged, and this one has a marginally working USB power port too, which I suspect will die in a few weeks as well. I'm confident between the lack of support I received at the Verizon store combined with the poor quality of the phone, I'll be an AT&T customer in another week. I do NOT recommend this phone, and given Verizon's decline in customer service, I'd seriously look into another provider as well.",negative

"This is a very nice, high tech phone. I really like the mp3 player/cell phone combo. I get very good reception with the phone and its pretty easy to use. A few dislikes... in order to use all of the functions on the phone you have to purchase expensive ""optional"" accessories (Blue Tooth, Music Essentials Kit). also, the touch sensors on the phone seem to have a mind of thier own. I often end up dialing people on accident. The END CALL button is not easy to touch...its on the right hand side. Your other option is to slide the phone closed. There is no SpeakerPhone (other than listening to your song playlist. This is a more difficult phone to hook your charger, headset, usb calbes to.

VCast isn't available yet where i live, so Im not sure how good that is. with an upgrade at Verizon your gonna pay $220 for the phone delivered (and you will get a $50 mail in rebate). Then you will need to get your bluetooth, case, car charger, music essentials kit, and the micro SD card (i suggest a 1G). Your looking at $150 for those ""extras"".

"For some reason Verizon won't show my review for this phone after trying twice so I don't know if it's a glitch I hit or a nerve. This is what I said in my review: I'm a simple girl. Give me my phone. Throw in a cam and text messaging and I'm good. I couldn't care less about other features and will give a review based on common sense in comparison to what other people rate about. For one, people list QWERTY as a pro. Nooo really? And they list how battery life is poor. No it's not in fact I wish this battery came on more phones. If you're going to treat your phone as a freakin computer, of course the battery is going to die. Sometimes people complain of the camera having no flash. Photography 101...natural light is best light so if you're lighting sucks, so will the pic and artificial lights like the flash actually make your image worse. Now down to business. I love this battery because it lasts long and you can leave it in its charger without worrying if the battery will be overcharged. I don't have to delete old texts either for a very long time which was a problem on previous phones but I'm not a text fiend so maybe don't go by me. This was actually replaced at day 1 because the first env2i got kept shutting off. The ones my friends have also broke and are barely a year old. People complain I sound muffled which was NEVER an issue before with my samsung phones. With my current phone, I talk to my friend who still has her Env2 and I could hear the difference in clarity. My service keeps getting dropped in my room which never used to happen, especially when sitting by a window yet. And the key lock is useless. It unlocks in my pocket and apparently my pants end up calling my friends by accident. I always had basic flip phones so this was never an issue before. I wouldn't pay the going price for it and I almost regret even paying the little I did. It's not worth it and now I do my research online before buying a phone. I've never gone wrong with a Samsung yet (knock on wood) and will stick with them in the future. Nokia and Sony Ericson are supposed to be good as well but I haven't personally tried Sony and Nokia phones from Verizon seem to get rated very poorly I noticed.

This allows for crazt battery life because the headset is mostly off, along with keeping you from looking like the borg all the time [or just a jerk]. I could wish for a little more volume on this headset, but isn't that always the case? Sound quality is great, and it seems to be usable even in somewhat windy conditions.",positive

"I had Tmobile earlier and swtiched to verizon just bcos i was fascinated with the features this phone was offering...but once i got this phone today...i m totally displeased..The phone is BULKY..its fat and long with a longer antenna. I had v300 earlier and I thought it was thick but this thing turned out to be thicker. Silver/Black combo ..doesnt suit my taste atleast ...more or less looks similar to v600. Features are pretty decent,1.2 MP camera,mp3 player..which i haven't tested yet. As others say Bluetooth is just an exageration,thanks to Verizon. The best part is its screen,its biiiiiiiiiig, but the sad part is you(at least I) cannot press the * and # keys easily as its tooo far for your thumb. The outer screen shuts off in 5 secs ruffly..you cant even see the time as in v300 or v600. Infacct you have to press one of the buttons to see that. Verizon doesnt ship it with ANY GAMES AT ALL...I spent an hour searching for games which weren't there at all. I even tried the Motorola Mobile phone tools with the USB, sadly,even that was not able to transfer pics and ringtones in and out of phone, as was poss in v300. I seriously don't understand the problem with verizon,why it crippled it to an absolute NOTHING!. The flip opens and closes with force...ie it doesnt open up easily and smoothly.it just pushes on you( might not be a big deal but you do it for 10 mins and you minght end up injuring your thumb). I seriously doubt if it will fit in my jeans pocket..its so damn long, I only wish people don't misunderstand such a bulky thing in my pocket for something else...:-? Its a average peice,nothing awesome about it,but if you are a newbie to camera phones, this might be just for you. Think once before you buy! MOST IMP THING!!! Make sure your contract ends on your old service before porting number to the new service,or else you might end up paying a termination fee. I was about to pay $200 for porting 4 days before expiry of my contract,but long hours of calls to customer care on Tmobile & Verizon saved me from that. T Mobile cust care dint tell me , when last time I asked them about the details of porting.",neutral

"I didn't find either the cell boost extender 500 or 510 to be effective and worth the money. I returned both wireless extenders (500 and 510)after both signal extenders would repeatedly drop calls. I was unable to set up the equipment where the signal was ""just right"" enough to keep a call. Initially, I would get addtional bars of service, but then in the middle of a call, the boost would flash ""too strong"" and drop my call. Customer service was unable to help, since I couldn't sustain a call long enough get advice when I was near the equipment. Overall, the cost of the equipment was not worth the trouble and was ineffective for increasing and sustaining my cellular service through a phone call.",negative
"I traded my VX6000 for this phone. This phone has been getting fairly bad reviews across the board stemming from the lack of bluetooth support from Verizons end. People think that you cannot get information to and from the phone other than emailing back and forth, but they are wrong. I bought a 128MB transflash card and a SD reader for 40 bucks total. I don't have anything that can send Bluetooth signals anyway, so the fact that I had to buy a separate reader wasn't an issue. I can send pictures and ringtones to and from the phone without Verizon charging me. The only problem with MP3 ringtones is that you have to save them to the phones internal memory, so you have to chop them down and lower the quality to keep more than a few. The transflash card itself is worth the extra cost of this phone. I can grab pictures off the computer to use as wallpaper or as a contact ID, again for free. The camera is more worthless than my VX6000 indoors, but outside it takes fairly decent pictures. Overall it isn't as bad as people want you believe, but I only paid 150 bucks for it after rebates and incentives.",positive
This is my first blue tooth device and it has good features. I can play my podcasts stored on my phone through this to my stereo system. You can also listen to your phone caller through your stereo or the local speaker built-in (which sounds good for such a small device). I can say the built in rechargeable batteries (uses no AA or AAA batteries) last at least 4 hours of continuous use. I haven't used it beyond 4 hours straight. Instructions are easy to understand. Very happy with this Motorola item.,positive

"Much like some of the other reviews, I found this product very dissapointing. First, the documentation is minimal. I had problems with the software initializing the phone and after searching through the discussion boards online I finally found out that I needed to download a 25meg update. Couldn't they just make the software available for purchase online? The update did get the phone to work with the software and I can synch my contacts with my phone. The software interface is poorly designed and not very intuitive. It looks like software that was designed in a college computer programming class. Motorola should really take this product more seriously and design something that is more user friendly.",negative
The Jawbone II is not worth the money. I gave it 1 star because of the expensive price in relation to it's poor performance. The thing does not properly fit in the ear & keeps breaking contact with your cheek for jawbone function.

Sadly I threw away the packaging in haste and am stuck with this useless product that is now where it belongs, in the trash. Furthermore during the first week when the product worked, the reception was staticky at best.",negative
"Bought one on a business trip, working a trade show with no power to the booth, only to to discover this device doesn't work. Batteries do not make proper contact so it doesn't charge your phone. Other reviewers had the same experience, shame on Energizer for selling such a crap product.",negative
"I'll start with the bad first, given the amount of interest this phone has generated. 1) The Phonebook application is a little...wonky. Some people have said you can't add more than one piece of contact info per contact, which is NOT true. You can, but its nearly hidden underneath the ""MORE"" function while editing the contact. However, its not convenient and you cannot add additional e-mail addresses or phone numbers to your contacts using the Phone Tools app...which is annoying, since T-Mobile charges $30-40 for the hardware/software bundle. 1a) It also takes forever to scroll through your Phonebook contacts. I thought it MIGHT be caused by having some SIM contacts, so I transfered all of them to phone memory. No dice. The scroll speed is untenable. Even my wife's Moto V330 is quicker. What gives? I had to create a voice prompt for almost every contact in my list. 2) Even at full blast, the volume just isn't loud enough. Plus, the ""audio sweet spot"" on the speaker is hard to keep next to your ear. If you are planning to get a Bluetooth headset and use that exclusively, this shouldn't keep you from getting the phone. 3) Compared to a Samsung V205, a Sony Ericsson P910i and Motorola's own V330, the RAZR gets poorer reception. The previous phones mentioned all get four bars at my house. The RAZR gets 2. This even after calling T-Mobile tech support for help. Their advice? ""Keep turning the phone on and off and it will hopefully find another tower."" 4) T-Mobile offers NO games for this phone yet. Given how high profile this form factor has become, I find this level of support to be somewhat poor. I know - you don't buy a phone for its games. But just to show how lacking T-Mobile's support is...the RAZR includes a demo for BeJeweled. After the (very) short demo is over, it asks if you want to buy it. Clicking the link brings you to a webpage that says ""Sorry, we don't offer games for your phone yet"". My wife's V330 has a similar issue. She's had it for over 4 months and services like T-Mobile STILL offer no games for the phone. Again, I know you shouldn't buy a phone based on the number of games offered for it, but its still a feature, something to whittle away the time while waiting at the DMV. 5) Camera phone still only 640x480. Decent pics at that resolution, but given that there are cheaper phones on the market (I didn't get this phone for free) with higher pixel values, this is a moderate oversight on Moto's part 6) Phone response is fairly poor as well. Example - going through my contacts by pressing keys (going from Q to R to S)...so very slow. You think the phone hasn't responded so you mash the button again, at which point it responds to TWO button presses and you have to start all over again. 7) The Phone Tools application is a little user unfriendly and totally geared to people who mess around with Outlook CSVs on a daily basis. I've managed to get it to work, but not without some work. Alright, so now for the good. 1) This phone is a veritable conversation piece. Oohs and ahhs all around...if you care about that sort of thing. I usually don't. I just want a functional phone that gets good battery life, gets a decent signal and can withstand a beating (I'm a klutz). But if you do care about the conversation-worthyness of your cell phone, this one has it in spades. 2) Great battery power. I've had it on for 5 days at moderate usage and I've still got 2 bars left. 3) This is a sturdy phone. My kid has already dropped it on cement twice and I've seen NO scratches at all. Maybe I'm lucky, as another reviewer mentioned that poor build quality on his piece. I've not had any issues. The phone is rock solid. 4) The usual amount of ringtones and wallpapers....all of which are amazingly expensive. Why does it cost 2 bucks for a hi-fi ringtone lasting 20 seconds when I can buy the song at iTunes for a dollar? 5) The PhoneTools software allows you to create your OWN ringtones. I haven't played around with the software yet, so I'm going to guess that your abilities to import MP3s or CD-audio will be truncated to some degree. 6) Excellent Bluetooth performance. Haven't had the opportunity to test file transfers and such, but the RAZR's connection to my Moto BT headset is great. Doesn't matter which side of my body they are situated. Decent sound quality even at 20 feet of unobstructed space. 7) Did I mention this phone is attractve? 8) Ringtones can get quite loud, even without degrading ringtone sound quality. I wish the speaker was this loud. This phone has some serious shortcomings - most important among them is the poor performance of the Phonebook app, poor signal quality and low speaker volume. Ordinarily, I'd be bringing the phone back, like, tomorrow. But the design of the phone and its excellent BT performance makes me want to hang onto it. Hopefully, Moto learns from their mistakes and releases a RAZR V4 with better earpiece volume and snappier response times.",neutral

"I tried. I really, really tried. But this system is absolutely worthless in my situation. For background, I have held an Amateur Radio (HAM) license since I was in my teens (have held my Extra class for more than a dozen years). I have even written articles on antennas for the monthly Amateur Radio magazine. In other words, I think I know a little bit about how these things work. That said, I have been totally unsuccessful in getting this cell phone amplifier to work for me. First, the outside antenna (the flat panel) is worthless. Flimsy plastic unit that sits in a box you mount on the house or a tree. Supposed to be directional, but really hard to get it properly aimed. But, more important, the amplifier just doesn't work. For one thing, the amplification varies widely--from full scale, to no signal at all. Imagine how successful you can be making a call when the signal fluctuates that much. Also, the amplifier does not transmit a 3G (let alone 4G) signal. I can stand on the one corner of our front porch where we get limited signal and see one bar of 3G service. However, when I move inside and put the phone directly in front of the inside antenna, I don't even see 1X. Tried it with more than one phone (different brands)--same issues. I had a nice chat with one of the Wilson techs--he was quite pleasant and even sent me the better outside directional antenna at no charge. Helped by getting a little stronger signal (still fluctuates a lot). However, the unit is still unusable and it won't transmit 3G. So, I give up. It's obviously well past the return period and the warranty has expired. My fault. Suffice to say that I am very, very disappointed with this purchase and would not recommend it to others.",negative
"I have a bunch of pictures on my phone that I wanted to download to my computer, so I bought this software for my phone because you can't download them without it installed. Well, after I got it installed the feature to download media from your phone doesn't even work. It was available on the program, but it wouldn't let me click the icon so I can get the pictures off of my phone. After I searched online for awhile to try and figure out how to do it, I found out that Verizon or Motorola supposedly disabled the feature to download pictures from your phone. So this software was pretty much a waste of money. The only thing you can use it for is to download your address book and a few other things. Thank goodness I didn't pay very much for the CD. The company I ordered it from sent a cable with the CD, even though a cable isn't supposed to be included. So at least I got something useful from what I paid! The only way you can get the pictures off of your phone is to text them to your e-mail.",negative
"The concept of this Bluetooth earpiece is fantastic. However, I have returned this earphone and would not accept it for free. The package comes with multiple ear loops and ear pieces. This is a nice gesture on the part of Jawbone. I could not get the earpiece to fit properly against my face. This is crucial for the noise cancellation to work. Worse off, if you wear glasses or sunglasses, you will be completely frustrated at any adjustment you make to your specs as this will make the earpiece move out of place. This said, the noise cancellation will not be able to function properly. The sound is tinny at best. It is difficult to make out who is calling by voice alone. I did find that when I could get the earpiece to fit, the noise cancellation worked rather well. However, the louder the background noise, the more your voice to your caller sounds synthesized and will occasionally break up. The `talk' button is very sensitive. Any attempt to re-adjust your earpiece during a call in progress easily disconnects your call. This I found to be the most annoying issue with the Jawbone. For the noise cancellation, you have no idea if it is on or off until the other end states that they are hearing a lot of background noise. For the iPhone, which I know of, you have to answer the call using the Jawbone in order for the audio to come through the earpiece. If you answer directly on the phone, the audio will be directed through the phone.",negative

"I purchased the 250 device for my new Treo 650. I am very disappointed and will be packing it up to send back (the Jabra...not the Treo). I've tried it for a week and can't take it anymore. The only PRO I can think of is that it is light and comfortable. I do have a lot of CONS: 1. Range is supposed to be 15 feet. Yeah right...try less than 5 feet. 2. If you have the phone on one side of your body (i.e. in a belt clip) with the headset on the other side, it simply does not work. I don't mean it sort of doesn't work, I mean it doesn't work at all--every time. 3. When I have everything in order for it to work properly (i.e. the headset is within 2 feet of my phone on the same side of my body), the reception is spotty at best. Time and again, the person on the other end of the phone asks me if I am in a wind tunnel. At other times, they tell me that I'm fading in and out. 4. About 30% of the time, the Jabra does not realize my Treo has rung. So, I end up having to not use it. 5. When the Jabra does realize my Treo as rung, it takes about 5 seconds for it to realize this. As such, the Treo continues to ring. This causes me to fret...should I wait for the Jabra to realize my treo is ringing and risk losing the call to my voicemail? Or should I answer the phone. If I answer the phone prematurely (i.e. before the Jabra realizes it has rung), it takes about 3 seconds for the Jabra to connect. During this time, the person on the other end is talking and I can't hear. All in all, I considered giving this product a one-star rating. If you buy this...keep your receipt handy.",negative
"I bought this piece for the echo cancellation. (I did read the instructions) I haven't found it yet. The people/listeners on the other end of the line continously complain about the echo. They hear me as if I was in a tunnel. While you can use it in both ears, you will still have to completely plug it into your ear to keep it in place. The hook around the ear is just to prevent it from falling out of your ear and onto the ground as it does not hold the apparatus in place for a clear sound/connection. I have it paired with an LG-VX8300 and it does not maintain the connection. I keep on dropping calls. The sound is continously transferred to the phone itself leaving me driving down the road with an earpiece in one ear and the phone in the other. The battery time is less than the promised two hours.

"This is a beautiful and elegant leather case. It has four compartments on the left leaf to store Wi-Fi cards or SD cards, even business cards. I think it offers a good level of protection against scratches or damage for any fall, but the overall size of the equipment increases a lot; to a point that handheld can not be place on a shirt pocket, or jacket or pants pocket. So functionality of carrying is reduced if you do not have a bigger bag to place it. In my case, I always use a Laptop, so I store my palm on laptop's bag. Other complain I have is the lake of a way to hold the case in a strap or belt. That is way I am rating this neutral with 3.",neutral
"I purchased this a couple weeks ago to use it with various headphones like my Shure E2C. Perhaps then I'd have a solution that, unlike my iPhone headset, would stay clipped to my shirt and in my ears. Then I lost my iPhone headset and was forced to use this. I've used it with several excellent quality headsets for an overall disappointing experience. I like a lot about the adapter. The jack that plugs into the iPhone is small and round, like the iPhone headsets. The adapter has a clip (think iPod shuffle) that hangs onto the collar of my shirt well enough. Talking on it is fairly decent but other callers don't seem to hear me as well as with my iPhone headset, like the windscreen is missing or ineffective. But the deal-breaker for me is quite often when I unplug it, the iPhone thinks something is still plugged in. This is a problem I never had with my iPhone headset and is very annoying.

"The battery itself is fantastic and provides hours of extra iPhone life when you are on the go and can't be near an outlet. As any iPhone user knows, this is a must. The only trouble is that the cord it comes with does not fit tightly into the charging port on the iPhone. Thus, the only way to charge using this battery is to plug it in and leave it sitting untouched on a surface where it won't be joggled or moved. The slightest movement of the phone, or trying to actually USE it while charging, dislodges the charging cord. This is a big problem for girls carrying the battery and phone in their purses. There is no way to charge the phone inside your purse - the minute you pick up your purse and start walking, the cord will dislodge and the charging will cease. As an alternative, you can use the USB cord that came with your iPhone for this battery - it will work fine. But most of us use that for home charging and iTunes updates - it's up to you if you want that to become a portable item. The company that sells these batteries is top notch with terrific customer service. Very responsive and concerned about treating their customers right. They say they will send me another cord that fits with more precision into the iPhone port, but as yet I haven't received it, so I'm not sure how much better it will be.

"I have only had this a week but it has performed as stated in the package and in the write ups and reviews via CNET and others. My headset is paired with my LG Dare phone via Verizon. I hate to read on how to use and get things going. Literally, you get this out of the fancy tube package, charge it which takes maybe an hour. By the way it comes with a car charger, a wall plug and a all are USB enabled. I charged mine via my computer but I could plug in the wall to charge or in the car too. Even better since it is a USB plug I can even charge my LG DARE phone which has a USB plugs as well and really makes it easy and useful. After it has been charged I put it on my ear as you are advised to do, press the button and the device speaks to me to tell me waht to do to get myself connceted to my bluetooh phone. In a matter of seconds I was connected and able to do commands. I received calls, the ear piece tells me the number calling and asks me if I was to answer or ignore and you tell it and you get your call or ignore it. My calls have been very clear and you can adjust the volume right on the headset. Even when I rec'd text messages they were read to me by the headset. For me right out of the package the ear piece and the hook that goes over your ear were pretty basically a perfecet fit. Every once and while I might have to push the each piece back in but that is no big deal and with the hook over the ear it won't fall off your ear especially if the ear piece with the silicone piece comes out of the ear. It is a very small headset, smallest I have ever used and I have big fingers and hands so it was hard for me at first but again it does it for you, tells you who is calling, you state what to do and it does it. If you have things programmed in your actual phone it can follow some of those commands as well. In this case I have not read into the booklet in order to see how that works or how to set it up. For me this will primarily be used when driving or if I had to be out and about for an extended period I would probably have this on my ear. I would never use it in the office being you are actually have a converstaion with someone on the phone so speaking allowed would be no good in my office setting. Like with anything you get through Amazon, check the return policy, usually 30 days with Amazon, sometimes 14 days for certain products. Test it out, I'm sure there are many variables as you see in other reveiws so take all that into account. For me in New York City and in NJ and NY state I have had no issues and am very pleased with this device. Oh and it does have a big blue ant which is the main button on the unit. It does flash on occassion when the unit is on. for me I don't care I think it is funny but some may not think a light/button in the shape of an ant is cool. Again cosmetics for some is a big deal like a name tag on clothes or watches. To each his own.",positive

"The capabilities of this phone are amazing. It will do just about anything you want it to. I recently upgraded to a nokia 8gb n95 from a blackberry pearl. I was worried at first because I was used to the versatility and functionality of the pearl but the nokia did not disappoint. Strengths: 1 Camera (if you are used to a bit slower image processing speed) 2 Video capture 3 Menu organization and capability- they are well organized and after a bit of getting use to are easy to navigate. Also the option tabs actually allow you do things, justifying its ""multimedia computer"" title. 4 wireless lan- made very very simple 5 Video player (real player)- can easily put multiple movies on the phone after they are properly encoded (hand break works very well, especially the mac version. 3gp converter and DVDfab platinum work well also. you just need to use the presets for Ipod not pda or phone as you would imagine) 6 battery life- is much better than I expected. can easily go all day with heavy use. after reading some reviews I was worried that it would not last long enough, but as long as you are not using the wifi connection and bluetooth all day long you should be ok. 7 radio! -I did not think I would be impressed with this feature but it works well and is easy to use. The only problem is that you cannot play the radio through the speakers of the phone unless you have head phones plugged in??? that didn't make sense to me but i guess its a small price to pay. 8 speakers- the sound that this phone can make is amazing considering the size. much better than any other phone I have heard. 9 NES and SNES emulation!!! I like to show this off to dorks like myslef . took a bit of reading but vnes works well. Vsun was a bit more challenging to get working and it also does not emulate sound=( but oh well. 10 screen- is very large and crisp. video and pictures look great. 11 Ngade games look good for a phone, but they do not play too well. If you want to play games on your phone, you should get something else. 12 TV output- comes with the cable, just plug it in and it works no matter what menu you are in on the phone and looks decent on a standard definition television, HDTV...watchable, but not really. 13 no touch screen!!! touch screens are a joke for anyone who types a lot on their phone. I had an Iphone, and i went back to my blackberry in a 3 days. buttons and functionality are much more useful. The internet did work well on, ill give it that. mediocre: 1 The web browser- is not as good as other devices i have used. Does not scale the page to fit the screen, so to read some pages you are constantly jerking the cursor from right to left in order to read a sentence, making it very difficult to read a respectable amount of material. The multiple page system is cool though. The history saves the whole page to memory so as long as you don't exit out of the program you can quickly jump back to pages past with a birds eye view of the whole page. 2 Speaker phone- is great when you can turn it on. the problem is that when you get a call and press the answer key there is a 3-5 second delay to when it gives you the option of turning on speaker phone. This poses a problem because every time you use it (I use it a lot) the conversation starts out awkward because the other person says hello (wondering if someone is there) before you. I guess you could just answer it normally every time then turn on speaker, its just that talking on the phone while driving is illegal in my state, so its more of a problem for me. Weaknesses: 1 camera lens in not protected 2 operating system seems buggy and somewhat unstable. The phone freezes at times when connecting to a computer, with the only way to fix it being to remove the battery. Randomly you are kicked out of menus and sent back to the home screen, although this does not happen often. Also it can be rather sluggish. browsing through image/video gallery can be very annoying because it slows way down, and skips around a bit. Transition from one screen to another is not very smooth, for example when the phone is idling and the screen is black it tells the time, but in landscape mode for some reason. When you open up the phone or get a call it will flash around a bit before showing you the main screen. I feel that the opperating system is the phones biggest drawback. Its just not very solid (crashed on me 3 times in the first day). 3 included nokia software- is garbage. difficult and cumbersome to use and don't even bother trying to encode video with it. It made updating the firmware fairly difficult. Even something as easy as plugging the phone into the computer via usb cable can be frustrating using the connect software. you have to deal with it though if you want to update the software or install any third party apps. 4 data transfer speed- is agonizingly slow. takes upwards of 15-20 minutes to transfer a 700 MB file, even longer if you use a mac. 5 GPS- is slow, does not work very well and not as intuitive as other GPS devices. It helps to be outside but it can be difficult to get a lock on at times. also you only get a 3 day trial of nokia's voice directions, after that you have to pay a monthly service charge. I did not read that anywhere before I bought the phone. 6 Email client- is not very good compared to blackberry. You have to manually go into the mailbox and tell the phone to receive new messages. You can have the phone do it automatically as often as every 5 minutes but it does not work in my case because I have to hit the acccept button every time it searches for new mail because the phone says it does not ""trust the cirtificate"". Lame. so what I end up doing is checking my mailbox periodically instead of only when I have a message. Some people may not have this problem but I do with an owa (outlook) account. all in all, the email client is overly complicated. Cant they just make it as easy as beeping when you get a new email??? 7 keys- Key pad is a little small for my fingers but I'm sure I will get use to it. It would be better if it was a qwerty keypad but I am sure I will get over that as well. Over all I am very happy with my purchase. It is very expensive but if you want the best you don't really have a choice right now. The bottom line is that all the features this phone has to offer is amazing, and even though it has some quarks it is still a great piece of hardware. You may not want it to replace all of your other standalone gadgets (GPS, Ipod, FM tuner,and camera) but it certainly makes for a good substitute if you don't want to carry all of stuff around (or if you just want to make your friends jealous it works pretty well too) What is exciting about a device like this is that it gives you a glimpse at what the future of phones has to offer, and from where I'm sitting its looking pretty bright.",positive
"I have tried 3 different Motorola headsets with my Mororola E815 phone and they were all terrible. People I was talking to heard a terrible echo and they didn't fit on my ear well. Then I bought a Plantronics model similar to this Explorer 320, probably an older model. It worked great, but it had an annoying disco light show for not good reason. It finally stopped working after being dropped too many times. This newer model works even better and doesn't have the annoying disco light show. People say that it sounds as good as any POTS land-line phone. In fact I'm here now to order a second one to have as a spare. The price is definitely right! The only downside I've found is that the sound quality does drop when I walk more than about 6' away from the phone, very short compared to the Mororolas.",positive

"I've had this product for a month now and I have used it sevedral times. It fits well when the microphone is flipped to open position, but a little awkard when it is closed. So far, I haven't had any problems with it. but then again, I've had it for only a month or so. I can hear people and, more importantly, people can hear me. I haven't used the auto volume feature or may be I haven't noticed it. For around $55.00, I expected it to be in a new package, but what I received was in a plastic bag. No big deal, except the first one didn't work, even after charging it. So, I had to return it. The 2nd one works great and have been using it ever since. I like the flip on/off mic. This feature conserves battery life. When you order this product, just know that it is not from Amazon, but from a 3rd party. May be that's why it is not in a new package. All in all, I like it and am happy with the bluetooth ear piece.",positive

I removed the inside plastic from the top half of the case and attached Velcro to both top and bottom. I now have a case with a clip, and it closes to protect the front of the phone. It's still easy to remove the phone from the case for use. Thanks for your reviews, they helped a great deal.",negative

"I had to buy a headset due the new California cell phone driving laws. I did some research and decided that the Jawbone was the best, and after owning it and using it quite often for my job, I would have to agree. There is one easily fixable flaw though. The ear pieces and ear hooks are terrible. the fit is never consistent and over time, very painful no mater what combination that you use. I heard from many other reviews with this same problem and many fixed the problem with the Jabra EarGels. I bought a set from Amazon and after sizing myself with the large, the problem was solved. With a half drop of superglue to permanently affix the EarGel to the small plastic piece that the original earpiece was encasing, my Jawbone was perfect. It fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal. I can also wear it all day with no discomfort at all, and wearing your shades isn't a problem anymore either (sunglass temple laying on top of a poor fitting ear hook really sucks). With this tiny fix, you will definitely have the best looking, best performing, and best fitting bluetooth headset out there. I hope you enjoy it! Regards, Reinhold",positive

"Got this case as a gift from a friend who warned me about the possibility of ""pants calls"" (inadvertent calls due to the function button being pressed while in the case). I looked at the case for a while, though, and was pretty sure that it wouldn't be a problem if I clipped it to my belt. It worked fabulously for two days, and then I took a walk on my lunch break and discovered later that day that the headset was gone. The strap that keeps the headset in the case is fastened with velcro, and it seems this must have gotten snagged on my jacket and come open. I retraced my steps (the whole 2 miles) but found nothing. My analysis is that if you can put up with ""pants calls"" during a brief ""break-in"" period, the elastic sides will stretch enough that it will no longer be a problem. However, during this time the velcro closure starts to weaken and bend. Once this happens, anything moving over the case (a jacket, a shirt, even your arm) may cause the strap to come undone. With the now-stretched elastic, the case just doesn't hold the headset securely without the strap, so the headset tends to fall out easily. I would suggest another alternative, though I haven't yet found one that fits the H700. ***UPDATE*** I recently spoke with the friend who gave me this case and found that he had deliberately cut the elastic to make it looser (to avoid inadvertent calls). Due to this fact, I can only partially blame the design for the loss of my headset (the velcro closure was still weak). That said, I still stand by my one star rating. The case still seems like it would not hold the headset securely, and the pressure still causes it to make calls when you don't want it to.",negative

"We recently purchased two of these in retail packaging. The headset is small, light (plastic) and attractive. The buttons are ""concealed"" behind the outer plastic shell of the headset. While this makes for a more attractive appearance, it is difficult to locate the buttons and the response to pressing the buttons is less than clear. On one of the units the button at the back of the headset (used for pairing) did not work at all through the shell. In order to press the button I had to completely pull off the plastic shell. This is not something that I would want to do regularly. As to audio quality, they seem to work as expected. The headset is light and remains in my ear when using the ear loop.

"I know a lot of people have reviewed this item already and there isn't much more I can add, but here goes. I LOVE the toughskin case! I have dropped it many times on tile floors and it has survived just fine. That leads me into the negative side: the reason for the drops. The belt case holds it well, but the belt clip SUCKS. The spring on the clip is very weak and when I use the restroom (hence the tile floors) the weight of the phone on the clip spring allows it to slip off my belt. Luckily it hasn't gone into the toilet! I now have to take it off my belt when using the restroom and have learned not to set it down for fear of forgetting it. The clip is also not long enough for wider belts. I do like that the clip can stay open to prop up the phone if you are watching a movie. If the manufacturers would just beef up the spring and make the clip about 1/2 inch longer it would be perfect. Oh, and yes, I agree with some that the upper part of the clip does poke you in the belly regardless of your weight!",neutral

"Some positives - some important negatives: I purchased this because I wanted to be able to hear callers clearly and loudly. This headset is both crystal clear and the volume is excellent. On past cell phones, I max out the volume and it is still not enough. With this headset I have never maxed out the volume. I drive a loud two seat car, and even in that environment, I hear callers fine - with room the increase the volume is required (which I have not required). The unit fits comfortably in and on my ear. Negatives: EVERY caller complains about background noise - and I do not mean car/road noise. I can be sitting still at my desk and if I move around paper - people wonder what I am doing as the background noise it picks up is very annoying to them. As far as actually using in the car - any car - I can not. While I hear people well, they all get frustrated and say it is too hard to talk with me while driving due to background noise. The unit fits comfy - but it is a pain to put on. Definitely requires two hands - and if you twist the piece that goes over your ear the wrong way - you have to look at it to correct it which is not great for a hands free item (or fiddle with it a few times, which causes your call to go to voice mail or your caller to wait.... wait...). Don't bother using the button to connect/disconnect - the time required to press it is long. And if you hold it too long - you disconnect the bluetooth connection. I would give this unit 5 stars for listening, 1 star for speaking capability, 2.5 stars for ease of use. I would look for a different unit.",neutral

"This adapter does its job, that is, allowing you to use a stereo headset to listen to music/videos/radio on a pre-2010 Sony Ericsson phone with a FastPort connector. Sony Ericsson's FastPort connector is intrinsically poor. Sony Ericsson should have dropped it sooner than they did. (From 2010 onwards it was replaced by a micro-USB for data/charging and a four-pin iPhone-style mini jack socket for the headset connection -- a combination that is fast becoming the industry standard.) The FastPort connector was a bad design. It is common to find one or more pins not making good contact due to dirt; and any movement of the plug can make the connection intermittent. Using this adapter you may experience these problems; but they are the fault of the FastPort design, not this specific adapter. Note that if you want to use an iPhone-style headset-plus-microphone that has a four-pin (""TRRS"") plug, this adapter will NOT work as the jack socket is only three-pin (""TRS""). There is no adapter that I can find that connects an iPhone-stype headset (with microphone) to a Sony Ericsson FastPort plug. (If you find one please let me know via a comment.) I have made my own by cannibalizing an old Sony Ericsson headset with a FastPort plug and a ""4-pin to dual 3-pin splitter"" intended for connecting an iPhone-style headset to a PC's audio-in and audio-out sockets -- and then connecting the FastPort plug to the 4-pin socket. In case you want to try this the connections are as follows. Note that there are two wires coming out of the 4-pin socket (mic and earphones), so mark them clearly before you chop of the two three-pin plugs!

"I bought this Sept 8, 2016 and it was great! I loved it. I could moderately use it throughout the day and still have 30-40% left when I went to bed. Fast forward to about a month ago, I noticed the case fitting a little weird. The sides were bowed out. I didn't think much of it, maybe the plastic was getting loose from wear. A week or so ago I noticed the sides where the case was bowing wasn't because it was loose; the glass screen was lifting up. I searched trusty google for an answer to no avail. Today I noticed it was worse and searched again for a solution. Turns out the battery is swollen and was pressing on the glass. I can't say this is all PowerBear's fault. It may have been that I dropped it and it damaged something in the battery. But I'm within the two year warranty so I'll see if they're willing to help me.",neutral

"This is a well made case. It is stylish enough to be worn with business attire - and that is what it would look best with. The outside of the case is black and the inside is a tan leather. There is a small ""C"" logo on the outside flap...and it is not too big (about 1cmx1cm). The flap closes securely with the aid of a magnet. The clip seems relatively sturdy as I've been using it for the past week or so. If you would rather not attach the clip and use the permanent belt loop you can do that too. The reason this has 4 stars and not 5 is that it fits the DROID X a little oddly. It is actually somewhat difficult to insert and remove it from the case if you put the camera end down. I find it to be almost a two handed operation. That being said, it holds it very securely and will not fall out even if the flap was not closed. With the camera end down, the flap closes completely and easily. Also, with the camera end down you can access the top button on the phone as well part of the side volume toggle (probably enough to be able to press and silence the phone without taking it out of the case). If you insert the phone with the camera side up, it is easy to remove one handed but it does not hold the phone as securely. With the camera side up the flap doesn't close as easily. It still closes, but you have to push it into place a bit more to make it securely latched. Lastly, in this orientation the side buttons are very accessible but not the top one (unless you open the flap). In the camera down position the charging port will be available while in the case, camera up position it will not be. I do not have any cases on my Droid X - if you have any case whatsoever I seriously doubt this will fit. Overall I would recommend if you don't have a case on your droid X and are looking for a well made, stylish, and secure case for your phone. With a silicone case or anything that increases the outside dimensions of the phone this will likely not work well. I am considering trying to ""stretch"" it out a little to see if that helps. For the price, this is a good case/holster.",positive

"Both my husband and I tried this one, switching off with our H500. The H500, while an earlier model, is quite superior. the H800 is light, but bulky so it felt unbalanced on my ear.

"Product is just as advertised and stated by the many positive reviews. The headset stays on my ear all day and I hardly realize it's there. It is very comfortable and does not come off even with the hardest of head shakes. The control are not that hard, just takes a few times to get use to. I have not had any problems with the battery life; it easily lasts 16 hours every day, I just charge it every night. The sound is very good and clear, in a lot of my conversations I actually have to turn the volume down. I highly recommend this headset and for only about $40, you can't go wrong. Oh, also, I was a previous owner of the Motorola HS850 which doesn't stay on your ear very well and the volume was not great; this headset blows it away.",positive
It does its job as a extender for the IPhone/ipad otterbox/griffen case. However the audio quality is very bad. You can't hear lead guitars on most songs/backup vocals only rhythm guitar and lead vocals. Also for music that has vocals overlaying an computerized beat/percussion/sounds its really soft. Wouldn't recommend. Spend the extra 2.50$ for a better extension with gold male/female ends.,negative

"I wanted this headset for a long time. From what i have read it should be the best for what i was looking for. Its light-weight, had the type of over the ear style i was lookoing for, and i wanted something with a mic. Discovering, and set-up of the unit was very easy, it doesnt bother my ears at all, but the signal quality isn't the best. With my phone sitting right next to the device i could hear static, and people constatnly asking me if i was still there. More often than not, i would have to repeat voice commands 2-3 times before the headset would understand my words (i never voice dial unless i am in a quiet room or a place with no noise.) The call quality was decent when line of site was good! the volume was also a little low for my taste. I think the big brother to this unti would be a better way to go, but who has $100 for a headset? Overall i am happy with my purchase, if i had it to do over, i would save my pennies and get the newer version but this is doing its job right now.",neutral

When I put it in my pocket, has to be shirt or coat pocket, you still have to be careful because it seems like the ear loop could break.

I bought a different unit for my office and it works great. At the same time I bought this unit for the car. I wasn't sure what to expect. On my way to work every morning I call my wife and once I hit this one particular spot I lose the call. After installing this I no longer lose the call and I went from no signal to 3 bars in this spot. Where I would normally not be able to make a call I hoover between 3-5 bars. 3 bars if I previously had no signal and 5 bars if I had any kind of signal. I couldn't be happier!,positive
"The unit did help although not as much as I had hoped. I went from 1 bar - no cell calls or data, just text to 2 or 3 bars. I can now make cell calls and receive them but the data is still slow. I had hoped for more but the unit does work and made things better. You need to be within 10 feet of the indoor unit and in-line with it to get the best signal. I suspect that given the area where my cabin is and the poor cell coverage, that the unit did about all that can be done.",neutral

I have no problem with it other than the fact that the skin doesn't fit snuggly to my phone. Ultimately you can't beat the price, but it doesn't offer the protection that I would like.

"As others have noted, there is a hiss / buzzing sound on the handset, voice sounds very tinny as well, not what you'd expect for a $200 phone! The biggest disappointment was that this phone is NOT a true ""VoIP"" phone... it has a USB connection where it simply acts as an intelligent headset for your computer (Skype, Cisco VoIP client, etc). You CAN NOT plug this into your network and have it do VoIP on it's own. To me, this needs to be clarified on the package... I expected to network it and give it my SIP registration info, nope.

"I've owned the Nokia 6133 for about 1-2 weeks now. It is likely going back to T-Mobile. - As noted earlier, the phone is crippled not to accept MP3 ringtones. It can play MP3s in the media player and accept WMA ringtones, but you cannot set MP3 ringtones. Hmmm. - The phone does NOT have an email client, regardless of what the Amazon description says. This wouldn't be that bad except... - The phone will not allow Java programs to access the Internet. This is the kicker. This means GMail's Java client will not work. This also means that if you try to download an actual mail client, it won't work! Note also that the Nokia 6131 (roughly the non-US version of this phone) has all of these features. In order to get the features above on this phone, you have to pay someone to load the 6131's firmware onto it, which will likely void all warranties and lets T-Mobile get away with abusing their customers. Unfortunately, I think the phone otherwise is really nice. It has a beautiful screen, I love the push-button flip, and its more usable than most phones out there. However, in my opinion, it is inexcusable that T-Mobile has done this to its customers.",negative

"The phone operates ok in terms of signal and battery. But, the menu system is completely outdated and non-user friendly (like all MOT phones). Do their software engineers even look at NOK phones to compare at all before they launch a new handset? They are light years behind in the interface. You still can't store several numbers for one person under one name (each has to be a seperate entry). The phone's green call button is on the right (should be on let like every other phone). The most annoying thing are the buttons on the side that constantly get pushed in your pocket and change the ring style and volume. Each time they change, it makes a loud beep. This phone is not worth getting, especially now (I had mine for a year and am looking for a better phone now as a replacement). MOT phones in general are to be avoided.",negative

"I bought this battery to replace my original battery in a RIZR Z3, purchased from T-mobile new on January 25, 2008. The original had a date stamp of 20070625. The one I received had a date stamp of 20070210, older than the original. In addition to being older the black jacket was duller in appearance and had imprinted marks where the gold contacts of another battery left marks. The battery came in a small heat sealed plastic bag inside a bubble wrap mailer. I don't really know if this battery was new or pulled from a failed phone. It came partially charged and I immediately charged the battery. The battery seems to be working well so I put it on a volt meter to test it and while the battery is rated at 3.7v it holds a charge above 4.0v. (overvoltage is common to all batteries) I have been using this battery since I received it so it may work out despite the date issue. Time will tell. The price was good.",neutral

"I purchased a new Sanyo PM 8200 in 10/04. I loved the phone at first. Then about 3-4 months later (January or February) I noticed the part where my phone flipped open was cracking. I immediately took it to the store to see if my warranty would cover this crack. The CSR said it would and they'd tried to fix it. I left my phone for 45 minutes. Upon return I was told that since there was a TINY crack near the antenna on my phone, that my warranty was void. It took me refocusing my eyes numerous times just to be able to see what they were referring to. So I left with no resolution. And very discouraged and upset. In May '05 my phone stopped charging. Again, I went to Sprint hoping that maybe this time they would value my years as a customer and help me out. Again, I was cast away with NO resolution. The CSR said she wasn't familiar with my problem,(even though I researched the problem on many websites and there were many users who had experienced this) but she'd have a tech look at my phone. After 45 minutes, they said nothing was wrong with my phone, even after I asked them to plug it into a charger and they themselves saw it wasn't charging. The CSR suggested a new battery. So I purchased a new battery, thinking that MAYBE my 7 month old battery had died. I was LIVID! I was even more upset when that didn't solve the problem. I went back to the store a few days later to return the $60 battery and to see if maybe someone ELSE would be a little more helpful and he was. His name was Clinton and he replaced my old phone charger with the bar charger. He said that would solve the problem and it did, but only temporarily. As of July, my phone won't charge AT ALL. I have to prop it certain ways to trick it to charge, but even after an hour and a half, and it says its fully charged, it IS NOT and when I try to use it, it dies immediately. Now I have no use of my phone because it won't hold a charge. Will ANYONE at Sprint PCS help me? I have always taken my phone in when the problems were in their infancy. Now the problems have worsened and I feel I have nowhere to go for help. I want someone to help me and let me know that I'm not giving my money away to a company that could care less if I am a satisfied customer or not.",negative

The noice cancellation features in this headset are very impressive, not that I talk on the phone with a vacuum cleaner on! The headset's also pretty good looking. Now let me explain why I returned this product in exchange for a new and trusty Plantronics 510. The device comes with two ear loop things for each ear and a few inner ear thingys. I tried every single ear loop and couldn't find one that fit well enough to keep the headset close enough to my ear for the volume of the call to be high enough. In fact, I even tried using the ear loop for the left ear on my right ear. No improvements.

"I use Verizon 4G LTE and I read a lot of reviews for this product before buying. A lot of reviews said that it worked with their Verizon 4G LTE and that this product no longer gets hot which is why I bought this. It gets extremely hot, and my signal doesn't get better or worse when I use this product. I had to remove the brackets completely since I suppose they were designed to hold small flip phones or something, because there is no way my Samsung Galaxy could fit in this thing. I wanted to return this product but they wanted to charge me a 20% restocking fee so I figured I would make sure I am using it correctly. I wanted to give them a chance since I travel for worked and used it in a lot of different places and my signal never got worse or better when using this product. The signal strength on my phone remained exactly the same. This device also kills your vehicle's battery very quickly since I suppose it uses a lot of wattage which is why it gets so hot. I suppose it works for different networks even though they claim it works for all of them. If you asked me I would say that this company is a scam, and I am not that type of person to throw around false labels.

"My recent purchase of the Mobile Office Tools for Motorola RAZR 3 was everything I had anticipated. After reading previous owners' review, I made the purchase. Yes, it is a very basic tools package, but it is the best ""bang for the buck"". One feature that is worth the price of admission has been the ringtone editor. Although it may not have many all the bells and whistles other higher price packages have, it is well worth the $9 spent on this software. I've been able to create my own personalized ringtones from my extensive music collection and I'm not locked in to ""others"" idea of what part of my music makes a ""cool"" ringtone. Plus, the USB cable alone is worth the amount paid. I still have to work with the other features, but I've saved a bundle on ringtones alone.

"I really wanted to like the N78 - filled to the brim with all sorts of features in a very attractive case - but it was just too buggy to live with. Being able to set the phone up as a wireless access point using the brilliant JoikuSpot download was incredible, and certainly one of the things I'll miss most as I repackaged this and ship it back to Amazon. I feel (or at least hope) that my unit was just defective, so take some of the issues I had with a grain of salt - it may not happen on all devices, but here are some of the things I experienced: 1. Camera zoom stopped working after the first picture taken. It's a digital zoom, so not the most critical thing in the world, but still annoying when you want to frame a shot and can't. This was fixed when performing a factory reset using the *#7370# combination, however once I tried re-importing contacts, the camera zoom would break again. 2. I kept getting the phone's welcome message - about twice a day - no damnit, I don't want to see an introductory video on how to use the phone, leave me alone already! 3. Browser would crash and freeze constantly. 4. Phone would randomly restart - like right after going into Contacts to make a call. What I liked * JoikuSpot. One of the primary reasons I bought a Nokia - the ability to have a 3G based wireless access point on me at all times is really powerful and useful. * Screen. Bright, crisp, very nicely done * Design. Obviously very subjective, but I enjoyed looking at it in my hand - not something you can say about most Nokias * Predictive text. Coming from an old Motorola, I hadn't realized how horrible I had it. * Internet radio. I don't use my phone too much for music, but having all those internet radio stations has come in handy a few times and it's a pretty handy feature. What I didn't like: * Sluggish interface. This is my first Nokia smartphone, so I was expecting to see it fly based on all the reviews comparing this to previous Nokia models. There was a noticeable lag in everything I did. With fewer than 20 contacts on my phone, it took 1-2 seconds to load my list of contacts - meaning I couldn't just press ""Contacts + first letter"" to start filtering names right away - I had to pause for a second or two. * Menu-laden UI. I know there are plenty of shortcuts for this, but really, somebody needs to be taken out back and put out of their misery for the ridiculous number of menu options put in this phone. How often do people really make video calls - does that really have to be a default option when d-padding a contact's phone number? * Slow default browser. Opera Mini was orders of magnitude faster, but links from emails still open in the default browser, so having that suck still makes things frustratingly slow * Lack of camera lens cover. Not having it makes me nervous about ever putting the phone down on a hard surface Overall, I gave it 3 stars because I really liked the form factor, the screen, and just the sheer power of what it could do. If I could be assured that a new N78 wouldn't have the obvious issues mine had, I'd probably give it another go as there's really nothing else out on the market that has all this has for those in US 3G territory until the Xperia X1 comes out.",neutral
"I have to say that I'm quite disappointed with this product. It fits the product well but, on each side of the screen cover was a handle tag so that I wouldn't touch the sticky part of the cover. At first I thought this was a novel idea but when I went to remove the tag it didn't remover easily but it was difficult to remove and left sticker residue on the top of the screen cover. Now there is a spot in the lower right of the phone that picks up lint and makes it difficult to text or write. Other than this issue, the product is good. Cover's the screen well and doesn't residue the screen's brightness or qualit but, the fact that this reside remains is really unacceptable as far as a product goes.

"With this California law going into effect, I purchased a Bluetooth. Normally, I stick with Plantronics as they simply produce the best quality and sound. I opted to go with this Samsung. Samsung has relatively very good quality electronic devices, but this one is ......well...so-so at best. The BT fits fine and it's snug and light. But let's get to the real question; does the thing work? Yes and no. It works fine in a quiet environment. It has NO noise canceling, so it WILL pick up everything. You sound far away 4 out 5 times making a call. Functionality, it pairs well and it's a quality made product, but it's working capability is 50-50. I'll use this till it breaks or get's lost (in my case, it'll get lost). If you all have a few extra bucks and want the best of the best, then I recommend you pick up a higher end Plantronics or Jawbone bluetooth. Unless you're prone to lose things or break them, then go with the cheaper BT's. Hey - you get what you pay for. I'll pay for a Plantronics or Jawbone next time.",neutral
"I bought this solely to record my voice for video editing/commentaries I do with my friends. I only use the recording cable (pink), which works perfectly. Great recording quality.

I have a 3.5 MM Male to Male headphone cable I plug from the headset's transmitter to my PC. I use that for PC gaming, although I mainly play on Xbox. This cable plugs from the game chat cable (that usually plugs into the Xbox controller) into your computer. I use Audacity to record my voice. It's a free audio input recorder. The only reason I gave it a 5 Star review is to promote this product because Turtle Beach sells virtually the same cable for over 4 times the price, depending on what cable you get.

"Purchased this primarily to measure RF 'pollution' in my house and with my various devices (cell phone, tablet, Wireless Router, etc.). On some units, such as iPads it seemed to measure no Wi-Fi transmission at all. On others (cell phone) it would give moderate readings. Finally figured out the iPads are working at 5Ghz and the cell phone at 2.4Ghz and evidently the meter only goes to the old normal of 3.5Ghz.

"I have had a pretty good experience with the operation of the headset: - Comfort (5 star): Really the biggest strength. Over ear and nothing inside the ear makes this great for me. - Performance (3 star): Has been inconsistent. When I have tested the headset by calling my home phone, the sound is great. I often have people on calls ask me if I am on my cell or a headset. When I go back to the cell alone it seems to be fine (so not a cellular reception issue). - Other (? star): I plugged this in to charge it on the weekend. I have owned this since April and it has been charged 4-5 times. I started to smell plastic burning. I pulled out the plug and realized that the little headset was blazing hot and that the plastic was soft. Pretty scary situation. This was all with the Sennheiser cable and charger. I sent an email to customer service at Sennheiser this morning. They have a two year warranty which is pretty impressive. The reply was professional, but just a form letter. I would just think that if a human had read my email they would have been really concerned. I offered to speak with them on the phone and do whatever they want to determine the issues. I have not decided what I will do. I will probably mail it back to them. I have seen many other comments about short battery life and I just wonder if they have a product design issue on this related to the battery and charging.",negative

"I bought this to work with my iPhone. I usually only buy noise canceling headsets, as I use these mostly when driving with the air conditioning running full blast. So, lets start with the good. This is one of the smallest headsets I've ever seen. It comes with plenty of accessories, such as a desktop dock, and a travel dock. It fits comfortably out of the box with no need for adjustment. The clarity when running at it's peak is one of the clearest I've heard. The downside. The build quality of this is awful. It feels like anything can break it in half, doing anything with it. Because of this, if I want to put it in my pocket, I need to put it in the travel dock, negating the purpose of it's size. If I want to put it somewhere in my car, once again, I have to put it in the travel dock. This wouldn't be such a problem, but the top to the travel dock is so tight, that when you pull the top off, the headset loses contact with the magnetic connector, causing it to fly out of the case. This isn't a one time thing. This happens every single time. The noise canceling on this device is also the worst I've ever used. I've had several people hang up on me because of their inability to understand me when driving. This is completely unacceptable for a headset that claims to have ClearTalk or whatever it is they are calling it. After less then 15 minutes of having it plugged in, and having it on the clarity of calls goes down hill. I was on the phone with AT&T making adjustments to my data plan, and had to hold my iPhone up to my head just for what she was saying to be clear at all. Beyond that, I've had the headset for a total of 9 days, and the headset is now almost instantly starts playing the low battery sound, and goes dead within 5 minutes of being unplugged. Thats not on the phone, thats simply being unplugged. Before writing this review, I did some research on this headset, out of fear that I would be too harsh on this device. The static has been well documented in other reviews, as well as the noise canceling not being as good as expected. As far as the battery life goes, this could easily be a fluke with this one single unit. With all of this said, this is marketed as a higher end bluetooth headset. While this maybe acceptable as a lower tier model, the constant static, and the seemingly non-existent noise canceling I can't say I'd recommend this. If you buy this, expect a beautiful, yet fragile headset, with entry level performance. I have all ready submitted my request for a refund on this.",negative

This thing works very Well with Verizon cell phones. I like it very much and it is worth every penny. However it does not work that well with Sprint. At least not when Driving down the Freeway. IT could be that it works well on Sprint IF are in a week signal area. Now. I am not sure if the sprint problem is due to Wilson or Sprint. It could be that sprint does not have a good switching system when at high speed on the freeway. Thus the reason for Dropped Calls. So I can not at this time blaime Wilson. One other thing that bothers me. none of the Wilson systems support WiMax. WiMax is part of the Cell System now. A big part of the Cell System. Wilson should add support for WiMax as that is how Sprint does 4G as does Clear and other Data and Data Cell systems. Also it still supports AMPs analog signals. This was a technology that was turned off Feb 28 2009. So I would think Wilson would want to update these AMPs. But then again with the economy due mostly in my opinion to the current idiot in the white house they may not have the sales thus the $ to develop the changes. Also we all heard the BS the FCC is doing to try and It would seem decide that the airwaves belong to the government and not to you and I. So this may not be the foult of wilson as well. I know and have worked with the FCC and they were jerks 25 years ago and have gotton worce in the laat 25 years and certainly since The idiot in the white house too over and does not seem to realze we need a good leadar. We do NOT need a dictator. But he seems to think he is as does the current head of the FCC. Making decisions without the respct of you and I or our congesional reprasentatives who are suppsosed to be reprasenting us. In short I like and will keep and get 2 more systems as they work so well with Verizon. JamesD,positive
"This bluetooth headset has amazing call sound, I can hear clearly with the windows open in the car. The problem I have with it is that the connectivity is touch sensitive, so if I brush against the mouth piece it disconnects from my blackberry, or reconnects if it isn't connected. Wearing my hair down sets it off. It does this all the time, so when my phone rings it's sometimes not connected and won't pick it up. If I'm careful and keep my hair off my face it doesn't happen as often, but it gets annoying.",neutral

"Probably a 3 1/2 star vs 4, but since I had to choose, I chose 4. Here is the lowdown: 1) Did tons of research, mostly online but also at a local Best Buy. The best buy only had one pair of blue tooth stereo headphones period, and the sales kid (I do stress ""kid"") told me ""This is the only pair we have in stock right now and these are the only ones on the market...no one else even sells one"" of course theirs were $149 and they would not let me try them out. Also considered motorola, HK, samsung, and others. 2) According to C-Net, amazon, bizrate, and others these were consistently the best performers rated for bluetooth headphones...amazon had the best price, even over bizrate, ebay, etc. 3) Got the headphones in a very timely manner (it helps to live within one day delivery for supersaver shipping...heh heh heh) and set them up very easily for my wife to use with her new samsung cell phone to listen to tunes from the micro SD card. 4) SHE LOVES THEM....they work well in high-noise environments (the gym) they have enough volume, intuitive controls that are easily accessible and the bluetooth connection is strong. One of my worries was the fact that they were rechargable and how long a charge would last. She used them until they literally died before recharging and it resulted in over 10 days total - turning them off when not in use, then with a solid 4-5 hours of playback time, about 1 hour a day every other day. I imagine if you kept them on all the time and/or used the playback constantly it would likely give you 7 hours+ of playback time at relatively high volume. Good performance. 5) Here is the downside...they only fit medium sized people (if that is the right phrase). I am 6'2"" and large-ish (ok, 260 lbs). The behind the neck band, which works great for my supermodel-ish wife only works for me if I keep my head down, staring into my lap. If I move my head or look up (or even straight ahead for that matter) the neck band pulls the ear-pads off my ears enough to mess with the music. Not a good thing. Someone needs to come up with a neck band that is adjustable and will work for larger than average sized folks. 6) #5 above and the fact that the headphones lack a very broad dynamic range (somewhat tinny highs, muted mids, not very low lows) is why I downgraded this to a 3 1/2 to 4 stars, but really the music quality I would rate just below Very Good and the fit and comfort, for my wife at least, is exemplary. Nice job Cardo, now fix the head band and get a stronger driver and you will have a perfect set of headphones.",positive
"if you're looking for a smartphone that's cheap, with no bells and whistles, this is it. its easy to use, and can chat happily with my macbook. aesthetically, the palm centro is the perfect fit for small adult hands (like mine). if you're going from a numeric keypad to a QWERTY pad expect minor adjustment issues (nothing like driving a stick shift after cruising around in an automatic) but these should sort themselves out after a while. i wouldn't give a phone this pricey to a tweenie (having paid for an unlocked quadband GSM model), but its perfect as a starter smartphone for teens or adults who aren't willing to shell out large amounts of money for an iPhone-- yet.",positive

Holding the button for about a second initiates voice activated dialing (even when the keypad is locked). The sound quality seems just as good as my Apple headphones (that came with my ipod), and as others have stated the headphones certainly cancel out external noises. The built-in microphone also has excellent quality. My wife and I both tried it out and the user on the other phone cannot tell whether or not the person is using the headset microphone, or using the phone normally without the headphones. It doesn't require the user to yell to use the headset either; just speak naturally and it works perfectly. We even tried running and jumping while using the headphones (so that the microphone bounces around) and the sound quality was still perfect!",positive

"Please note that this is about HP6315 as a cell phone from T-Mobile. It is okay as a PDA but it will make you miss your old cell phone. I, regularly, experience line drops. It does not roam well at all that when you are moving in a vehicle, it is most likely that you will not have a good cell phone service. It is very slow to find a tower to connect. Since it consumes considerable amount of power, it goes to standby mode quickly and then, when you power it up, it is very slow to get signals. Its rather bulky antenna is not doing much good since it does not have strong reception at all. T-Mobile sent field tech several times to check for signal strength in certain locations where my 6315 is weak and they say that their signal is fine.

It seems the music playing capabilities are useless without purchasing some extras. The phone is very nice looking and getting used to the buttons was quite easy. Nice size for the phone as well. Oddly, my vibrate stopped working after 1 day and verizon is providing me with a replacement phone. I've never had a problem with my 2 previous LG phones, so this was a surprise.

That being said, I've had no problems with it for the 2 weeks I've had it, but I'm just afraid over time it will catch on something and break off. I have a CapsuleRebelM and it fits and holds the phone nicely. The clip allows the phone to rotate, but it only rotates 270 degrees. I also like the fact that the phone faces inward to your belt--it protects the screen in case you rub up against something and allows me to show the nice stylish features of the CapsuleRebelM.

"This is a nice looking case cover and the material seems very durable. The side pocket is large enough to carry a few standard-sized (e.g. Carl Fischer) books, a reed case, etc. My main complaint is that the case cover will not stand stably on its four posts (feet). The bottom edge of the bag is not rigid enough and the posts tend to fold inward. The cover fits snugly around my Buffet Attache-style case, which is both good and bad. The good is that the case does not slide around within. The bad is that it makes opening the case nearly impossible without first removing it from the cover. Also, the zippers rub the corners of the case and I'm always concerned that the zippers may mar its leather. There is little room in the main compartment for anything besides the clarinet case. Another pocket would be nice for a clarinet stand or a spare mouthpiece. All in all, this case cover does its primary job well.

"Hi, I had total of 2 of these headsets and I actually liked the headset at first because of the way it fit my ear, which was very tight and sturdy. The very first one that I bought I had troubles to get it connected to my phone right away, which what I thought at first could be a compatibility issue with my phone, even though my previous headset (Motorola H375 - see my review about it) NEVER had this types of connectivity issues (but it did have some durability issues of it's own). So after playing around with it I ended up doing a hard reset on my phone, after which I was able to finally get it connected. I've been using this headset for about 3 months, during which I had some connection issues every now and then, but I was always able to get it resolved each time after playing around with the settings and the phone, which in some cases took quite a while. Anyways, the last month the connections issues started happening more and more often and one day my phone wouldn't see the headset at all. I tried my old cell phone and my wife's cell phone to recognize the headset, but neither one would ""see"" it, even though the headset itself seemed to power up and making appropriate sounds as if it was in a pairing mode. Ok, I thought maybe it was my bad luck with getting a defective piece, so, since I REALLY liked the durability and fit of this particular headset, I went online and ordered another brand new headset just like this. The story with this one was that it would power up but none of my phones would be able to recognize it from the very beginning after I received it, so I am sending this 2nd one back for a refund and looking for another substitute in the meantime. Even though I really liked the way it fit my ear, I will not waste another dollar or a minute of my time trying to get one of these to work. For all these reasons I do not recommend anyone to buy it.

The software from Motorola to allow it to talk to my XP OS, particularly the driver must be hidden well or I am more computer illiterate than I thought. Motorola's website is a maze of marketing and help screens. The voice command feature on the Razr is inconsistent. I am with T-Mobile that requires the phone to provide the voice command technology. When I was with Sprint they had a web base voice dial that was reliable. Obviously, there is a reason I am not with Sprint but that is a different story.

"I've had this little gadget for a couple months now. I stuck it low on the front windshield and even with the deep slant in the windshield I can still reach my phone when its mounted. I bought this for the price, the ease of inserting devices, its generality if i change phones or want to attach another device, and the long, flexible mount. I was skeptical about window mounts and wanted a vent mount instead, but my vents are vertical so I was forced to go this route. Ultimately I am very pleased with the purchase. I can use my phone's gps without dangerously looking in my lap and change songs/stations in internet radio without having to look down. The material is fairly durable and nothing has become loose or fallen apart and after around 2 months its still attached to the window.

"I thought I would post my experience with orderig this phone through amazon. I had many doubts, so I hope this helps a few people out. Here we go: I was a verizon customer, with an expired contract. I wanted this phone, so I switched to cingular. I also wanted to keep my number, but I wanted this phone more than I wanted my number, so I ordered it knowing I might not be able to keep my verizon number. It turns out I WAS ABLE TO KEEP MY VERIZON NUMBER. It is true this phone comes ""activated"" and they even sent me my new cingular number in an email before I get the phone in the mail. As soon as I got this email informing me of my new number, I called cingular, explained the situation, and there were able to assign me my old verizon number. They also said Amazon will NOT charge me to do this. Things were looking good. I anxiously watched the tracking information and I was pretty upset because it didn't update for three days. On the 17th of feb, I ordered the phone. On the 20th it said USPS was notified of a package, but hasn't got it yet. On the 23rd, it updated and said my phone was in my city on the truck. So the tracking is pretty lame, but in the end, my phone came in the mail two days BEFORE the expected arrival date, another bonus. I opened it up, popped in the sim card, and within 10 minutes, I was able to make calls. Accessing the internet is another story. I called tech support and they were really nice. We tired everything known, and after an hour I was told to take it in and get a new sim card. Great. I took it into cingular, and they worked on it for about an hour. It would work with the sim card from the store managers cell phone, but not with mine. We tried two new sim cards, and nothing. Finally, another person came to the rescue, recognized that it wasn't authorized somewhere in the system. We had to call a special data technical service and they activated it. It now works great. So after about three hours, I had my phone and I was ready to go. First thing I did was install google maps, everything worked great. I don't know if the problem was becasue I got it from Amazon, but it eventually got fixed and the phone works flawlessly. I have never had a treo before, but I really like this phone. The camera is weak, but everything else is very functional. I would give this phone 5 stars except.............. Next up, email. The push email client was very easy to setup. The problem is that it drains the battery life like crazy. It is essentially useless becauase the battery only lasts about 8hrs with minimal use (10 minutes, internet, 20 minutes talk time, 10 minutes playing with the contacts/scheduler) This won't even get you through the day. If you leave your house at 8am, your phone is dead at 4pm. Not cool. I did some searching, and it turns out the push email client drains the battery because it is constantly connected and sending information back and forth. Disabling this feature should increase battery life tremendously. Apparently the 8125 runs the same program without a problem, and because this is such an issue, they will come up with some kind of software patch. I am going to charge the phone tonight, turn off push email, and see if it makes any difference....i will update with results. UPDATE: Sorry about not updating, I forgot because my treo's battery is absolutely fine now. It turns out many people jump the gun and freak out about the battery life during the first week. After using it for a week and barely getting through an eight hour day, it seems the battery gets stronger and stronger. I also read to keep it plugged into the charger whenever you get the chance. It seems letting the battery run dry and then charging it is actually worse, so keep it charging as much as possible. After a week or two, I was able to get 24hours easily without charging. Just last night, I noticed my battery was about to die, but that was because I hadn't charge my phone in about 40 hours! So, bottom line: The battery will suck for the first couple of weeks, but stick with it and you will end up with a pretty sweet phone.",neutral

"The mobility concept is great on this phone. It has a base unit that acts as a charger for the phone and the headset. For quick calls, just pick up the cell phone style phone and talk; it has a small speaker and microphone on the face. You can also switch on the speakerphone which may be OK for certain uses but otherwise sounds like your in a cave. In both of these functions it performs pretty much as expected. Where the main problem lies is with the Bluetooth headset. I have had 3 replacements and the last time they replaced the entire set from a different production batch, all in hopes of solving my only problem: The headset generates an intermittent pop-corn popping sound that is so irritating to you and the person you're calling that it drives everybody crazy. Plantronics needs to go back to the drawing board on this one. In the mean-time I'm living with it but using a corded 2.5mm headset instead of the Bluetooth.

first off Ronald is 100% wrong on the MP3 function. YOU do need to purchase from VCAST or buy the kit. you can purchase a Micro SD card and a card reader. then transfer the songs to the card.

"I bought this without realizing it was 3g, not 4g (LTE Verizon) compatible - of which there are no current mobile 'multi-user' booster products available for the latter - yet. A competitor claims to have a product orderable March 1, 2014 and Wilson tech says 4-6 weeks. Wilson does have a single user 'cradle' 4G LTE Verizon compatible model. But we're planning a road trip soon and wanted a multi-user unit sooner than later so everyone in the vehicle can have some broadband while we're tooling through the hills and dales. Plus the unit was on sale, about $250 instead of the near $500 list - probably in anticipation of the newer 4g units coming available. There is no doubt this signal booster will improve voice call strength and likely less drops. A test call connected quicker than expected. But I am dubious of the 3g data speed. Reason: I conducted a speed test with smartphone app using the booster - about .28 MB download. I stepped outside the car without the booster and had about .40 MB download pure phone (very disappointed but I do live in a rural area but there is cloudy/rain inclement weather tonight). I would have expected the opposite download results, and closer to 1MB download with booster. The Wilson Tech (who seemed sort of irritated on the phone to take my call), stated best circumstance would be 3g speed of 2 MB max. Whereas their upcoming 4g (LTE) unit (model 460110 I'm told) might expect 2 MB minimum and up to 20MB max. The other aspect I am a little disappointed is you need to use both in-car and outside car antennas. The outside car antenna has a pretty small magnet, and is about 12"" tall - not as sturdy or as large as I'd hope for outdoors and to obtain a better signal but maybe that is the optimal size. Now, the indoor antenna is the bigger disappointment. The manual says the phone or data card must be within about 2 feet of the indoor antenna, and the indoor antenna should be vertical - and that means using the adhesive backing on what they suggest is the driver side seat near the vehicle center passenger compartment. Not sure how long the indoor antenna would stay mounted with adhesive - the other is do I really want to have adhesive residue on (cloth) seat? So if this is a multi-cell phone booster, everyone needs to be huddled around the indoor antenna within 2' else there is no connection to the booster. Not realistic if you're a passenger and hoping for a data boost. Or how about making a phone call, the indoor antenna needs to be pasted pretty close at shoulder height. I realize there are probably cell signal FCC regulations, but a 2' distance is not realistic in today's SUVs. I tried the booster for internet data, and really did have to get within about 1' of the antenna. How did I know? I had placed the indoor antenna on the backseat floorboard during installation and started testing and wondered why I wasn't getting any signal boost reading. When purchasing the device I thought the indoor antenna was optional, but obviously not since there are both indoor and outdoor antenna booster ports. I have not tried to use my Verizon Phone 4GLTE with mobile hotspot enabled but that would probably be the booster death blow if it doesn't work. Why? Because I pay for phone tethering and the intent is I am mobile and need to use my laptop/ipad connected to my smartphone and have a stronger data signal so I can be productive for IT 24x7 on-call systems support. Unfortunately, I may have to buy the 4G LTE version once it's available for my use (mobile and backup for home residential broadband failure) and give this 3g unit to a different vehicle just for voice. The Wilson tech did say 4G is not used for voice so I guess at the minimum that's what this unit will become... later after our road trip. If possible, I'll update these comments later after mobile hotspot use, highway/rural moving phone calls and our road trip literally through the hills.",neutral

This product works well. Went from 0-1 bar of 3G in the house to full and no longer dropping calls.

"The case fits my Palm Centro quite well. I bought this 5 months ago. The first 3 months it held up perfectly. Then the clip broke off the pouch, and I used the belt loop. That lasted 6 weeks, and finally that tore off as well. So, for an overall cost of about $5 (including shipping), this works out to about $1/month. My Palm OEM case ($20) lasted 15 months ($1.33/mo), and my designer case for my Treo before that ($30) lasted 1 year ($2.50/mo), so this is the cheapest way to go, but do not expect a long term commitment. UPDATE: After above case went belly-up, ordered a new one using the link from my prior order. Top seller listed was AccesoryOne, so that's what I clicked on. Just received it and noticed the case is completely different from my prior one. The case interior is smaller front to back (package says HTC Magic Case, which is a thinner phone) so my Centro needs a firm push on the flap to close. Magnets on the flap are weaker and don't keep closed as well (also probably due to the thickness of the phone). So THIS version is not good for the Centro (and is not the one pictures - although neither is my last one). Thinking back, I believe my last order was through Bargaincell, but I'm beginning to think this is just a generic listing and the individual places just give you what they are selling that month. Maybe safer going with a brand name, but this is cheap (if it works for you).",neutral

They could have left it out as far as I'm concerned. the resolution is awful.

The size is about right, although the cheap case that comes with the phone isn't functional at all. I'm going to have to buy a better one. I don't like where they put volume control.

I am not sure if this is an issue with other phones, but I will say that with my wife's v551, there seems to be no problem. When the headset is not engaged in a call, it disconnects and reconnects every minute or so, giving me the annoying static in my ear every time it connects. I didn't think this should be a problem, since both products are made by Motorola, but even with tech support the issue could not be resolved. This is why I say in the title that it is not good for the V3. It might be fine with other phones, as my wife's v551 seemed fine. 2) The boom is too close to the ear speaker. I was told by many people with whom I was on the phone that they could hear themselves ""echo"". I could resolve this by turning down the earpiece speaker. That is fine while I am at home in my office, but if I was in the car, where there is more ambient noise, turning it down led to ME not being able to hear clearly. This is a problem that I had when I tried it with my wife's phone as well... so this is not really a ""fixable"" problem, as far as I can see. Both of these conditions were eliminated by purchasing the Jabra BT-250. While it is not as small and convenient to carry, it retained all the great features of the HS850, without the annoying problems listed above. Again, this may not be the case with other phones, but I have to give a VERY negative report with the Motorola V3",negative
"So far I still like this phone. I have not seen yet my next phone after this one. I like everything about it except I still can't open ""Memory Stick Micro"" slot I am afraid to pry it open. So anyone can help I appreciate it",positive
"I have used this phone for over two months now. I use this in my home office. Frankly, for the price, I was expecting more; the syncing with Outlook is limited, and accessing the number in the phone books is time consuming,as you can only start with the first letter, it won't allow you to type in the first couple of letters, getting you directly to who you are looking for. Better software should have been included for this price. The buttons, while of good quality, are VERY SMALL. So if you do a lot of dialing, I would not recommend this phone. Again, I guess no one did any customer research at Plantronics. On the plus side, the range for the phone is great, and the sound quality & comfort of the earpiece is good.",neutral
"I ordered 3 of them from ""Bargaincell"", the clear flexible, black flexible and clear hard cover. They look great and protect your phone real good. No complains on sound. Only complain is that even though all 3 items were packed in the same box I was charged separated shipping charges for each item; I ended up paying 8.04 instead 2.68",neutral
i like the blueant very much .but there is one thing that i don't like is the fact.they said in the instruction that the phone would sinc with my Verizon phone but went i tried i would work even after i call the technical support they could not help me so i cant use feature of total hand free to accept the calls or hang up so there you have it and the phone does cut in and out when driving.so don't believe everything that they tell in the video,negative
"I purchased this because I lost an iPod Touch from a Nite Ize case that had a velcro flap. The flap came open the iPod was history. This case has the same durable belt loop but the zippers are a HUGE disappointment. I've only had this case since mid December and one zipper has completely broken off the product. The real trouble is that it needs to be a bit larger just a 1/4 inch or so so an iPod Touch can be easily inserted and removed. My Touch has a rubberized wrap around it that means you have to pull the zipper just a little harder. Too hard this time. Before this happened the string on one zipper fell off. That was easy to fix. Nite Ize has the ONLY cases that STAY on your belt. They set the industry standard for folks in uniform EXCEPT when it comes to zipping, sealing, and keeping what's in their product safely inside. Make the ENTIRE product a STURDY product - PLEASE! I can still use this with one zipper but it's going to be for a short time I'm sure. You would have had a five star rating had this lasted longer than two months.",neutral
"Charges my iPhone 4S and iPad well with the USB ports. My only advice: if you are hooking it up in a golf cart you might be tempted to hook it up to the first battery's positive and the last battery negative, because that is where all the other red and black wires go to. Don't do this. I know from experience it will instantly fry the device just slightly quicker than I realized what I was doing. (It was kind of like shutting the car door and seeing your keys on the seat while it swings shut) That is because your are hooking up to 72 volts (6 batteries in series x12 volts). Just hook up to one battery, any one you want. This works fine but is always on. I don't think that will be a problem. But then again I am apparently not very smart.",positive
"Let me start by stating that I live in a major city and not the country so my issues with cell phone coverage in my car is not as troublesome as some others. However, I do occasionally lose service, which is especially frustrating when using the GPS navigation feature to find my way somewhere. The WeBoost Phone Booster is fairly straightforward when it comes to installation and activation. A small antennae is mounted to the roof of the car and a chord is run through the passenger's side door to the booster. As other reviewers have noted, the adhesive used to mount the unit is rather permanent and is not easy to move once attached to the dash. So, know exactly where one wants to place the unit before using the adhesive. As for the actual performance, I have only had one dropped call since attaching the unit and virtually no lag time when using the internet. The navigation works just fine without any error messages stating that the signal was lost. This was especially impressive considering the particularly harsh winter conditions which resulted in a lot of cloud coverage, which usually interferes with the GPS signal. Downloads speeds were also slightly improved but not significantly. Overall, I was very impressed with the results with the WeBoost phone booster. If one uses the car quite frequently for traveling, then this unit is easily a welcome addition. Overall, this is a worthy purchase for anyone looking to improve cell phone coverage in vehicles.",positive
"A simple small flip cell phone holster for three bucks - can't go wrong. I am a light phone user - this holster works great for me. My Nokia 27xx sticks out 1/2"", but that makes it easier to pull the phone out. Friction holds the phone in place, no flaps, and it won't fall out.",positive
"The initial headset we purchased had a glitch-it would go back into pairing mode once it was shut off and then turned back on. We even tried installing it on a different phone and had the same result. After consulting the manufacturer it was determined to be defective and it was returned for a replacement to the seller. The second one arrived and it has a different set of glitches, but it is workable. This one must be turned on and off at the menu within the phone as apposed to the headset which is inconvenient. My husband also complains that this headset is not as loud and clear as the first one. As a whole it does what he needs it to do-he is a diesel mechanic and needs it to be rugged, water resistent (he sweats outside in the Southwest GA heat) and it cancels some of the wind noise he has around him. But the quality is inconsistent and it was frustrating to have to return the initial headset because of this quality issue.",neutral
"Wow! I am totally impressed with this bluetooth. The ease of setup was absolutely shocking. I just turned it on, then turned on the bluetooth on my phone, and it did the rest. I have used it for about 4 days now, and talked on the phone the whole time to and from work, and the battery is still fine. I have not charged it yet aside from the initial 1st charge before my first use. YAY! It also automatically connects to my phone very quickly and easily. I have had some trouble with calls getting dropped with other bluetooth devices, and this one does not drop calls when switching. I have an iphone, so switching to the phone speaker is very easy, if i don't want others in the car to hear my conversation. The speech recognition is also a great feature to make outgoing calls. I have also asked whomever i am talking to if they can tell that i am on a speakerphone, and they said no. I would definately recommend this item. It also comes with 2 visor clips so i can keep one in each car. Way cool item.",positive

"The Sidekick II phone is amazing, it's like a mini laptop. The only problem is that you would get more service coverage with a walkie talkie than T-Mobile. If I'm in the middle of Hollywood or Los Angeles, my connections are still bad even in such a metro area. I have trouble havea conversation for more than 10 minutes cause it just gets so staticy and disconnects at random. If T-Mobile had good coverage it would be great, but they don't , so it sucks.",negative

"I bought this about a week ago. I had read the negative reviews, but still wanted to try it. It was on sale at Fry's for $29.99. It is fantastic! There is a tiny lag when you answer a call... but I silently count 1,2 and then say, ""Hello""... and it's fine! Calling out is fine... you probably have the delay, but the ""ringing"" makes it seamless. I have a great DECT 6 Panasonic cordless with 3 handsets (the reason I didn't want to buy an integrated system). My ""tones"" actually do work with automated systems (like banks and credit cards)... so I am not sure what that is about. My only complaint (not a big one) is that when I pull up in my car, it connects too quickly sometimes... but, you can pick up one of the handsets connected and hit ""Talk"" and it immediately connects me. You could also very quickly choose ""Use Handset"" on your cellular. The sound quality is great! The dialing #1#, the number, and # is actually great if you have a landline too... or Magic Jack in my case. (You dial #2#, the number, and # if it is the 2nd cell phone... but I only have 1) I don't have anything else bad to say! For this price, it is a slam dunk!",positive
"I bought this and the package clearly said it works with Nokia and Blackberry. I got it home and it does NOT work on my blackberry 7250 at all... nothing. When I plug it into my Nokia 2115 the phone says 'not charging' then proceeds to do just that... (not charge). What the package didn't say (but their web site did) was that their are TONS of phones it doesn't work with. On the positive side it comes with a small light bulb you can plug in that does works. So I guess I bought a $20.00 AA tiny flashlight. Of course, I could have bought a flashlight like that at the dollar store... for a dollar! UPDATE: I contacted customer support and they shipped me a 'newer' model 5.6V which thay said would work on the blackberry 7250... well... nuthin', didn't work. On the positive side it does charge my nokia so it's not a total waste... but I never would have bought it if it didn't work on the blackberry!",negative

"This is a truly lovely wireless phone with excellent comfort, portability, range and noise cancellation. I've been using it for several months in a very noisy server room environment. Having gone through multiple supposedly ""noise canceling"" phones, this is the first one that really passed muster with customers. I had been using this on my standard phone line and integrated it with my laptop's Outlook directory. Simple, easy and excellent! Within 5 minutes I had 200 contacts loaded onto the phone. It's nice that you can manually edit the phone numbers and contact information before they're loaded onto the phone so you don't wind up with extraneous data. I just switched over to using VOIP instead of a phone line, and decided to use this with my Mac instead of Windows. Honestly, it's not so good. Unlike other phones that are specifically designed to be VOIP phones, you can't dial the phone through the handset anymore - you have to use the softphone. You can answer and disconnect calls, but that's all. The software for the Mac is not as mature as it is for the PC, either. The Calisto Pro utility for the Mac frequently loses connectivity to the Mac and doesn't show up in the utility bar that it's lost its connection. So, you'll be dialing away through the softphone only to hear your party answering - and you're not audible. It's not a very professional image to present if you're using this for work, as I do. So far, the software for Windows is more reliable. No matter which operating system - once you have a successful connection, sound quality is excellent. The earpiece is very comfortable and the device has wonderful range. I'd like to see Plantronics improve the quality, reliability and feature set of the VOIP offering for this device. Otherwise, it's a pretty expensive wireless USB headset - albeit one with excellent clarity and range.",neutral

"This is just a great deal. These are the same exact battery strips you see hanging on the rack at your local battery store. For less than what they charge for 1, you get a strip of 5. Unfortunately, you can't just buy 1 for 1/5 the price, so if you don't need all 5, you'll end up wasting batteries over time. I decided to get a full strip since I have a bunch of quartz watches, and this is a fairly common size. I'll probably use 3-4 before they all go dead. Seller ships quickly, but there is no tracking ability, and they ship the battery strip in a standard letter-size envelope.",positive

The only downside to the purchase from the vendor, was the expectation of receiving a retail packaged product, that is, in a box as was shown along with the product. The CD and the cables arrived in a Ziploc bag, stuffed inside a very non protective blister envelope. Maybe I just have to realize we live in world with lower standards, but still - a Ziploc bag!",neutral

I have only had this phone for a few days now but I have used every feature it has to offer. I must say that this is the best phone I have ever owned. The only real problem I have is that my fat fingers sometimes hit buttons I didn't intend but it's really not that big of a deal; I just need to re-train my hands. I am happy with the picture quality as well as video quality.

"This product has disappointed me. The sound that I hear out of it is tinny and sometimes too quiet. People I've talked to with it say, however, that I sound better, so it does that well, at least. It is also remarkably difficult to get over your ear, though once it is there it is not loose at all. From the celebration of this product that I had read, I expected more, and certainly expected better sound quality than the Jabra I was replacing. Really bad was who I bought it from, Tiger Direct.

"I have extensive experience using portable batteries for my Iphones and Ipads over the last 5 years. This model looks and feels great cosmetically. Especially useful for people that want to use it in public and show it off. It feels well made to last a long time. The weight is good for a 5200 Mah battery. The red laser feature is a good bonus for people who would use it and avoid having to carry around a separate laser pointer. The flashlight is always useful, and not rare for portable batteries. I didn't like the feature that it would not shut off itself after having unplugged it from my Iphone. I have to manually remember to shut it down, although it probably uses extremely low power when on but not charging anything. The USB holds cables in a well sturdy way. I can let the battery dangle by itself at the end of a USB cable while holding an Iphone without the battery falling off. Very useful when leaving it in a bag/purse that it will not disconnect when shuffling around. My first power test showed a weak result, but I think that is not unusal for the first 1-2 times you charge most portable batteries. Test #1 Iphone 5 charged a total of 165% plus ~20% usages while charging = ~185% total. Test#2 charged 49% on an IPAD 1 Test#3 charged 50% on an IPAD 2 Test#4 Iphone 5 charged 184% + ~30% Usage = ~214% These results are right in line for the stated 5200Mah; which is good. This battery would suit well people that want a sleek looking good feeling battery they can show off and/or want a laser pointer built in. It is also good for most people if the price is competitive with other similar batteries.",positive
"I'm a computer professional, and use a lot of other wireless technology for a variety of things - so I finally decided to get a BT headset for use with Skype (which I'm using more often these days). I've tried using this kit with Win XP/SP2 and Mac OS X 10.4.4 - and have toyed a little with it in Linux. I got suckered in by this kit in a store (headset + dongle), and figured I'd give it a shot, after checking out many favorable reviews of the H500 online. Unfortunately, the reviews I read were all about how it works with BT cellphones - I should have dug deeper. The headset itself works fairly well - sound quality on my end is decent, volume is usually fine (depends on both sides of the call, of course), and battery life so far has been great. However, every single person I've talked to has complained of a background ""buzz"" that sometimes makes it difficult to hear me. Also, they note that every once in a while the sound ""hiccups"", and they hear a repeat of something I just said (ie they hear the same bit twice in a row...and then it skips forward a few secs to catch up with me). I've tested it out a bit with the Skype test account system (""Echo123""), and heard the problems myself... Since I've been using Skype for a couple of years now (with wired headsets) with no trouble, I'm fairly confident that it's not related to Skype itself or my computers... I originally suspected the cheap USB dongle (Moto PC850), but my Mac laptop has a built-in BT card, and it has the same problem - so the trouble must be either with the headset itself, or how it all works together with Skype. So it's back to reading reviews for me, to find another solution. I definitely recommend against this ""2-in-1"" kit - save yourself the time/hassle and grief and get separate (better quality) pieces.",neutral

"I just finished boxing up my Supertooth 3 for return back to Amazon. I had it for 3 weeks and used it with my Blackberry Curve 8320. It worked as advertised--loud speaker, the other person could actually hear me (unlike the majority of Bluetooth devices), address book sync worked (not automatic, you have to select ""transfer address book"" from the Blackberry menu), NAME of caller was spoken when the caller was in my address book, NUMBER of caller was spoken otherwise, long battery life, effective magnetic clip, and automatic pairing when I got in the car. So why am I returning it? Because there is one big problem. When I exit the car, the bluetooth connection does not automatically disconnect until I am out of range (about 30 feet). If I am still in range and receive a call, I can answer with my handset but the audio will go to the speakerphone that is now locked in the car. Transferring the call on a Blackberry is a big deal. Press a button (second from the left), then use the trackball to select ""disconnect ST 3"", then click the trackball. This might sound easy when you're sitting at your desk, but just try it in a dark windy parking lot. Moreoever, the entire procedure goes like this. The phone rings. I quickly have to think if I am still in range. If I might be, I have to quickly look at the tiny bluetooth icon on the ringing Blackberry to determine if I am still connected. If so, I have to hit a button to answer, then quickly hit another button to bring up a menu, then turn the trackball while being careful to stop at the right menu choice, then click the trackball. Sounds easy? Just try it. (This actually happened to me a few times.) I could turn off the Supertooth every time I exit the car, and then turn it back on when I enter. But this is a big deal too. You have to hold down the Main Function Button for 5 seconds before it turns off. Just try doing this every time you exit the car.",neutral

"As of this writing, I've had this unit for about 2 months, and I've used it daily. I paired mine with an LG ""Voyager"" VX10000 (which has voice recognition software). I've found it has excellent sound, and it's range seems to be about 15 feet (less with walls). HOWEVER, as others have already reported, the ear loops are poorly designed, uncomfortable, and not reversible. Also, the manual is overly terse and unhelpful, and the unit is somewhat difficult to detach from it's charger, once connected. Brief digression: I also wish this (and most other bluetooths for that matter) had a ""locate"" tone, so that if you mislaid the earpiece, you could use your cell phone to locate it by making it chirp. I mean c'mon ... it has a low battery and an on/off tone, so why not an ""I'm over here !"" tone ? Anyway, in a crowded field of wireless earpieces (which many people either love or hate, regardless of make and moder), this one seems to be above somewhat average. If sound quality is your most important criteria (especially if you use voice recognition to dial), I can recommend this unit. On the other hand, if your foremost criteria is comfort, a reasonably well written manual, and simple idiot-proof features, look elsewhere.",neutral

"I bought these for my iPhone today. The Good: - I like the format and the size. - I like the deep bass that only comes from headphones with large drivers. - The technical features are good (iPod track controls, phone toggle, volume). The Bad: - The hard over-ear plastic thing that hangs on your ears was far too rigid and really began to hurt after about 30 minutes of use. - Sound quality is not very good. Bass is good, but high frequencies are trashed, most likely by the Bluetooth compression. Chances are the headphones themselves can reproduce music well, but the radio transmission process is creating noticeable distortion and garbage in the high freqs. In summary, had I bought these just for use with phone conversations, I probably would choose to keep them. But they promise good music listening (and now I want that!) Sadly though, they aren't good enough for discerning listeners.",neutral

The compact and light-weight design makes it possible to use this headset without an ear-band. This is particularly important for people, like me, who wear glasses. This headset is so easy to slip on and off your ear. No more two-handed operation. It is also very comfortable to wear and it doesn't bother my ear even after an extended period of use. In comparison, the Jawbone is not as comfortable and often pinches my ear after a while. The voice quality is good but not the best, I give the Jawbone an edge on this. Nonetheless this unit gave me the most reliable voice dialing accuracy. The other units, Jawbone included, are just not consistent enough for me to use voice-dialing. This model does not come with an a/c adaptor. Rather you can recharge it through a computer USB port or a car charger and both of which are included in this model. To my surprise, my computer USB port is hot even when it is in sleep mode. So recharging can be conveniently accomplished this way. Overall, I recommend this product to people who're looking for a light-weight headset that can be slipped on and off your ear easily, comfortable to wear, with good voice quality, and consistent voice-dialing.",positive
"A wonderful headset, you need to get used to wear this headset easily. Works very well, other party stop complaining about sound quality.",positive
"Bought my first BT headset based on a review on some dude's blog. Should have come here first. He thought it was a great buy. I think it is crap. Crackling is all I've heard thus far. Jabra is no help. They suggest resetting and this and that. Nope, didn't work. Still just crackling. Don't they test these things? I'm furious. Don't buy this. Just don't. Yes, it is pretty, but for so many reasons, don't buy this. Oh, and to the reviewer who said that the little clear earpiece keeps falling off. I haven't seen mine since I tried to use this in the car. Probably popped off and is between the seats. This is the definition of bad product design, and obviously some crunch to get the new product to market. Nice job Jabra. Jerks.",negative

"I bought these for my digital camera that gobbles alkaline battries. (literally a pair every 40 minutes of use!) They were expensive, but last about 5 times longer per charge than alkalines, and you can use them all the way to the end. With alkalines you can only use them to a certain point, and the camera dies. (at least mine does) Plus when you use up a charge on these, you just pop them in the handy little charger, and in 2-4 hours you have a ""new"" pair of batteries! I love them!!! I would DEFINITLY get these again!!!",positive
"So far an excellent product. Took a little learning time, but now very happy with it. I would reccommend it.",positive
this is very good product at this price. Its nice handy and protects your mobile nicely. However there are 2 problems with this case. 1. the Belt clip is not very tight and have very little grip on the belt because of this your case can be ejected from the belt with a little push. It fell down couple of times even if you're doing a brisk walk. 2. There is no magnetic lock or button lock on the upper flap of the case because of this your mobile can flip down if you're moving a little fast especially walking or running.,neutral
"I admit, I was turned off at first by the size and shape, but was easily won over by the quality of the sound and the comfort. This is as good as bluetooth gets. The downsides are the rediculously small buttons for power and volume, which are almost unusable for most, but fine for me. Today I thought I lost my headset. I found it in a parking lot, ran over at least once, in the rain for at least 12 hours. 10 minutes under a hair drier and it was working again! I will buy another when the time comes.",positive
It picks up a little to much back round noise causing you to turn off the radio and close windows. The battery life even when turned off is to short.,neutral
"The item is a scam... I got the unit from Plantronics. Before I purhased the item I asked if this items works with HP6315 iPaq. They say yes... A week after I received the items I was having a lots of problems with it, So, i call Plantronics ... Now there story was that the M2500 has a clitch with iPaqs. For the unit to work properly I had to so a soft RESET after every use. Everytime I got a message I had to manually reset the M2500. They refuse to return my money.

"I bought this thinking it would cover my whole RV, after all it says for multiple users, however you have to have you cell phone between 8 and 12 inches from the flat antenna...which makes it's use really limited. It does seem to boost my signal by 1 or 2 bars, but being with in 8 to 12 inches of the interior antenna is really hard. I find I use my ear buds for phone calls and set the phone near the antenna...not really what I had in mind. Amazon has done us no favors taking out the spec's tab on their web pages.",negative

"This unit is pretty good. I have had it since Christmas 05 and no real complaints. I am using it with a Audiovox SMT 5600 (by the way, the SMT 5600 is an excellent phone...do some research on it if you are looking for a phone). I do have the ocassional static problem when the phone is in my left pocket and the BT is on my right ear. I'm not sure if that's from my phone or the headset not making a good signal connection. I can duplicate it by placing my hand over the top of my phone covering the signal and I get static, so it may be my phone. Also, when not it direct line with the phone, such as in another room and a good 20 feet away. One of the reasons I like this headset is because once it's on your ear it stays on. You could run, jump, ect without fear of it falling off. It picks up my voice really well and others hear without any problems. I gave this a 4/5 because of the static/signal problem and the fact that it is a bit tricky to get on when you are in a hurry. I found the best way to get it on is to insert it at the top of your ear and rotate it on. With a little practice it gets easier but every now and then it gives me some problems...but once it's on, it's on and you will forget it's there!",positive
"The USB cable works with the EnV2. I'm not really sure if the disc did anything (I put it in the computer and just let it do it's thing), but in order to get into your phone and utilize the USB cable, you need a third party program (that Verizon and LG will not support) to ""get"" into your phone. Google search BitPim, and it will have all the essential tools and software you need to hack your phone. It's free. Don't expect to be able to work a miracle just by plugging your phone into your USB port. LG and Verizon have locked the phone so that you have to buy every blessed song and program from them. Fight the Power!",positive
"I titled this ""Purchase these for the right reason"" because i should have done my homework before buying these earphones. The one and only purpose I intended to use these earphones for was to listen to music while I am at the gym, or walking from class to class. I really had no desire to use them for ""conversation"" purposes.... So it has a mic on it, no biggie they are usually located on the chord around the chest area which i will hide under my shirt. THINK AGAIN! the right earphone chord (before they intersect at the mic) is about a foot n half long. The chord to the left earphone... a lengthy 5 inches. so in order for me to have music playing in both ears, there is a heavy mic piece resting on the left side of my jaw bone, and an extra 7 inches of useless cord dangling underneath my chin going to the right ear. The person who designed these earphones obviously would never use them for half of what they are good for. LISTENING TO THE !#$^ TON OF MUSIC YOU HAVE ON YOUR PHONE!",neutral

"For the price I thought it would be sturdier. It definitely takes trial and error to get the imprint. You have to make one swift blow that presses hard and hold it at the base.

"I upgraded to the N75 from the Nokia 6230; I'm a big fan of AT&T service on Nokia phones. In general, I'm happy with the N75. It is certainly cram-packed with features; bluetooth, phone, mp3, fm radio, some organizer features, a scaled-down version of adobe and real player, external memory card is hot-swappable and very easy to access. Many phones require you to open up the device and remove the battery to access the memory card which resets the internal clock and date. I haven't experienced a poor battery life the way some other reviewers have, maybe I'm just lucky. This phone has just about every feature you can think up without having to go to a blackberry-type form factor, and I really wanted a flip phone rather than a bar phone. My main complaint is the processor speed and performance; whenever you want the phone to do something, there is a noticeable delay, up to a couple of seconds, and there is a slow reaction to the keypad buttons such as transitioning from phone mode to camera mode, etc. If there was a faster processor in the phone so that it responded more quickly I would have no complaints.",neutral
I purchased this headset for a backup for my jabra stereo headset. The jabra headset would not last through the day. It would have to be recharged. In addition the volume was not enough to overcome the local noise sometimes. This motorola headset was half the price of the jabra one. It has lasted through the day no matter how long I have been on the phone. PLus the volume is much better than the jabra. I am very happy with it and am going to buy another one for my car. The only complaint is the ear pads fall off easily but that is a minor problem. I recommend this headset.,positive

"I spent months researching this phone became it out and comparing it with others so I was very excited when I bought it a year ago. I can't even tell you how disappointed I have been with it. I mainly wanted a phone that I could browse and check email with. After a year and multiple trips to the sprint store, I still have not been able to reliably or effectively check my email. Web browsing is a joke, it takes so long to load most pages (even the mobile friendly ones) that it often just times out. In the last 3-4 months it has started doing a soft reset without any prompting. You pick the phone up and hit a button to make a call or check messages and it automatically goes into a soft reset. I can't find any rhyme or reason to it and neither can the sprint people. The lag on the touch screen can be horrendous sometimes but completely normal at other times. There does not seem to be any correlation in this problem with temperature, time, or action. My final complaint may be related to Sprint, rather than the phone, but weekly I will have someone tell me that they called or left a message which I never got (or received hours, sometimes DAYS later). The phone is a joke unless you are outside in bright sunlight. So two hard resets, multiple visits to the sprint store, and countless soft resets, and I have finally decided that I hate Sprint and I hate the Centro. I'm counting down the days until I can switch phones and providers!",negative

Letters are clear, you can chat on it! I need to buy the case for it if they sell it. Definitely if you are getting a smartphone, or a Blackberry, this one is it.",positive
I have to agree with a previous 1 Star review. I purchased this so that I could use a 2.5 headset with my Tour. You can barely hear a thing even with the volume turned to max. Don't waste your money on this. Just buy a 3.5 headset that will fit the Tour. That is what I ended up doing and am quite happy with it.,negative
"When I opened this up, my very first impression was, ""I can't believe I spent money on this?"" It's flimsy. It barely covers the back.

"I previously owned a Plantronics 645 which I liked quite well, but it came time for a replacement. I typically only use the headset in the car, so I was looking for one with good noise cancelling features. After using this headset for about 2 weeks, I received so many complaints from the people on the other end of the calls, that I had to stop using the headset and use my handset directly - just so they weren't completely annoyed. I really like the fit, feel, and weight of the unit, and the incoming sound quality was always excellent. When I was stopped at a traffic light, outgoing sound was very clear and nice, but unfortunately even the slightest road noise was a big issue. I really wanted to keep this headset because I still have some older accessories that are compatible, but unfortunately I will have to return it. With the DSP technology and Audio IQ I expected this headset to be better than my 645, while it ended up being much worse.",negative
"Plantronic Discovery 665 is good,the voice is clear and no noise. The only problem is the talk time,it comes around 2hr 30 minutes, not 3hrs(as they said). Other then that everything is good as of today.(I am owning this from July 2008).",positive
"I would like to give this phone a five star rating but there are a few concerns that I wrote as follows that makes this phone less than ""perfect"": 1. The slider screen is shaky and not built solid enough. For all the features and applications that come with it I would expect a more sturdy hardware. If the phone slider is in original (closed) position and it is shaken very lightly you can feel the screen is loose. Not expected this from Nokia. I am going to exchange it with another one and hope that it was just the one I got and not a problem with all of them. 2. The software that the phone comes with is a little slow and even slower to update the software using a Windows XP computer. I am usually very good with hooking up peripherals to my computer but it took me almost an hour to just update the software from the computer. Kept giving me a ""Firewall"" error, disabled all firewalls, then download the update and kept giving me a ""no NOL"" or something error and just on a random try worked and took around 20 minutes just to update the software. However, I can deal with that I guess since it is not an everyday thing. 3. 2.8"" Screen is big but not big enough to fully enjoy all the cool features it has. I have a 20x20 but still had to strain my eyes on some videos and websites. The zoom features is good but then most of the webpage goes out of field of view. But then again This is what makes it really cool looking and not big and ugly as other phones with some of its features. Overall, I still like the phone and agree with all the good reviews given. I decide to keep it if the the screen thing is good with the replacement. Screen being loose is my biggest concern which is not good for a new phone and gives it a non-expensive phone feel. If anyone else has experienced this please let me know I am curious if it was just me.",positive
"I recently purchased a BlueAnt X3 Micro, only to have it give no sound after a week or two. People could hear me, but I couldn't hear them. (I checked the volume!)

I've tried the wall charger and the usb charger. I will have to ask for yet another replacement. When it works though, it is a great bluetooth headset, and works really well with my Nokia 6233 and has great sound. If it wasn't for these quality issues, I would recommend it totally.",negative

"Easy to install and move to other cars with simple setup (can even use outside car, e.g., in a meeting), simple to use, quickly acquires connection with phone, works acceptably well (see minor negative points below); comes with both USB and car chargers (good job); holds charge a long time (weeks) Some minor negative points: 1) Could use more volume, have to turn it up to max, sometimes still not enough, but generally acceptable 2) Found locating the unit on the sun visor as recommended somewhat awkward some of the time, keeping mic pointed to pick up voice well, some difficulty with people hearing (depending on how much I'm using the visor for intended use - blocking the SUN); I found the included metal clip worked fine on the extruding shelf of the dashboard, above speedo/etc., better positioning of mic, easier to use without taking eyes off road; clip is padded, no worries about marking dash; works for me 3) Have heard some complaints in reviews here at Amazon about microphone boom sticking in, doesn't spring out when pushed (which means you can't power the unit on); I bought a unit from a store locally to try out first, and it began doing that; returned it and bought from Amazon (almost half price)...this one hasn't done that yet, am hoping it doesn't.

"I bought this piece when it came out, so I paid the full retail cost at that time. I had finally lost my beloved Jabra that fit perfect (and never fell off) after buying a separate ear (bud?) kit. I've always had a problem with these things feeling comfortable in my ear, with previous bluetooths causing pain after short periods. The problem with my Jabra was that people complained that they couldn't hear me. Truth be told, I had problems hearing them at times. So I decided to go with a higher priced bluetooth. Ran me around $80 and I thought my comfort and sound problems would be resolved! Alas, it was not so. While very attractive to look at, the problems were actually worse than my $40 Jabra. At the current price of $19.00 here I would say it is worth that (especially if you are on a budget), but I give it a big thumbs down for anything over $30. You could probably find an ear kit to make it more comfortable. I'll give it 3 stars for it's current price being so low.",neutral

Based on the performance of this case, I purchased the same brand for my son's LG Dare phone and have been just as satisfied. The case does make the phone a little bulkier, but it's a minor issue compared to the great protection it provides.",positive

"Like many others, having seen all the glowing user reviews on Amazon I decided to give this one a shot. I had never used a bluetooth headset before and had never owned one, but have generally had great experiences with other Amazon items that have been well-reviewed. I've had it now for about a month. Bottom line: it does what it's supposed to do, and does it well. Like another reviewer, I've had people tell me that I sound clearer on the headset than on the phone (a Motorola RAZR with Verizon service). I've never had problems with the connection to the phone. On comfort, it took me a while to realize that I had to just let it rest on the outside of my ear canal rather than try and make the earbud really fit in it. It feels a little loose, but never in danger of falling off. It also fits a lot better on my left ear than my right, and I never thought I had asymmetrical ears before, but so it goes. It just works, and there's something to be said for that. Consider this another wholehearted recommendation from someone else who saw the great reviews for this thing and took the plunge. *EDIT: I would take off a half a point if I could for that annoying blue light on the boom mic.",positive

"I bought these buds at Costco for a bit less but worth the money here if you don't go to Costco. My husband has the more expensive Sony brand Bluetooth buds and loves them but when he listened to these buds he wasn't sure he heard that much of a difference to justify paying twice the price. The only outstanding feature that I liked on his Sony set was that it felt lighter and less cumbersome. The Motorola Buds are not heavy but they are a bit chunky feeling around the neck. Probably not an issue until you've worn the lighter options available. One thing to note here is that they aren't really wide and not very flexible. I'm not heavy but I am 60 and fuller around the neck than I used to be. I can feel the buds around my throat sometimes. My husbands Sony buds don't give me that sensation that something's on me. Overall, the Motorola has great sound and clarity with both calls and music. One thing I absolutely love are the magnetic ends that keep the earpieces in place when not in use. The magnets are strong and the buds seem to find their way to the end without me placing them securely. Pairing is easy so far with all of my Apple and Samsung devices. People are talking about the perspiration issue with these buds...yes there is the warning not to wear them in cases where sweat comes in contact with them. I have worn them around Las Vegas Nevada in 100 degree temps and of course I perspired. No problems at all with them getting sweat on them so far. The temps will be going higher soon and I will most likely be wearing a Frog cloth around my neck to keep cool. That won't stop me from wearing my buds because it won't be wet, just lightly moist. I will update the review just for and FYI sake for those interested. Like I said, the sound is great and the ease of use is equally great. Pairing fast and easy. Buttons well placed and easy to manage. Designed well but remember that they can be restricting for larger necks. I recommend these buds for anyone if you want the convenience of Bluetooth without spending a lot.",positive
"Does it work, yes. Does it perform as advertised, no. The Amazon description states that it runs from battery power. IT CAN'T. Therefore, I can only use it in a car....

"I got this so that my wife could talk to family after having our first kid. I knew that she would want to talk to her sisters and parents a lot, especially when I have to go back to work. I also know that while the baby sleeps, she will also. Therefore she had to be able to talk and take care of the baby at the same time. Not easy with one hand! The wired headsets would not have work well, as infants will grab and pull on anything they find. So far we are both very happy with this headset. Voice quality for the other caller is better than with our RAZR phone. We just took off the ear hoods and use the boot shaped ear piece and it stays in place well enough for our use. Overall we are very happy with it. EDIT: After using this headset for a while longer, I would no longer give it such a high rating. It sounds fine still, but quality and comfort are sub par. The little rubber ""feet"" that fit into the ear tend to come unglued from the earpiece, witch makes it hard to keep in place.

It sits on top of your ear instead of in it, and the quality is much better. The sound is about the same as the Jawbone.

Also, several people I've been on the phone with indicated that they cannot hear me clearly, no matter I am using noise cancelation standard or max. The noise cancellation does not work as they show in the video at all. After all, I think this is a good headset for people that does not travel a lot and do not need to talk on the phone while driving or walking in the office.

This adapter is essentially identical to the original that came with my MyFi.

"I have used this item a few weeks for my Samsung Instinct mobile touch screen phone - not iPhone - while teaching sailing in the Chesapeake Bay. It works perfectly as advertised. It fit snugly in my life jacket pocket, and I tied the drawstring provided to the ""belt"" on the jacket for added protection of slipping or falling out. For extra thin phones like mine and the iPhone, Aquapac says it might not float. In my basic quick tests (in the tub, sink and in the Bay), it floated for a second before it started to sink slowly; enough time to grab it, or jump in and get it. I think if you actually captured more air in the pouch before closing/sealing it, it might be a little better. I wish there were some kind of extra floatation in the plastic seal or the knobs themselves though. But, if you are really concerned, I'm sure you could tie a float to the top and it would be fine. Using the touchscreen is really easy and almost like not being in a case. Texting with two hands in horizontal orientation is a little difficult with the virtual keyboard the phones have, but I just tucked the plastic seal and extra curve at the top behind the phone, and it was fine. If you have more air in the case, you will notice a little bubble while doing this, but you can always push air out before sealing it, and the screen is even easier to use. Ringers and sounds, including actually talking on it while in the case, are great. No one noticed that I was talking through plastic and sound in my ear was normal. Like their website says about pictures, there might be a little fog or haze, but not necessarily. My pictures were overall, except a few that reflected the sun, normal. The phone is a little tight and sticky (glossy big screen against the case) to get in and out of the case, and mine is a little narrower than the iPhone. When I added a thin silicone cover to my phone and put it in the Aquapac, it actually slid a little better in and out. Overall, it's great, and perfect for anyone that doesn't want to get their phone wet without a big case.",positive

"I own two different Motorola Headsets, and with both of them, I get frequent complaints that the person I'm calling can't hear me clearly. It may be that I have a very wide face, and the microsphone is too far from my mouth. I'm not really sure why, but regardless, I've been looking for a new headset. I heard about the Jawbone's remarkable noise cancellation features, and thought perhaps it might solve the problem by doing a better job of picking out my voice from surrounding. It didn't. In fact, it's the worst headset I've ever used. Never mind the fact that it's cheaply made. Never mind that the buttons are too stiff and hard to use. Never mind that the ear hook is a real pain to get over my ear... All these things might be forgiven. The real problem is that it simply doesn't work for me. I initially spent a bit of time trying out the different earbuds and hooks to find a combination that would give the voice sensor good contact with my face, as I had heard that this was an important factor. I then tried a few (unfair) experiments to see how it worked. I called myself on my land line, and I got feedback when held the handset in the normal position on my off ear. When I covered the mouthpiece, the feedback went away, but I still got poor sound quality. I thought that perhaps the sound conducting through my head from the handset might be confusing the noise reduction, so I put my land line on speakerphone. I got an interesting reverb effect which indicated that the noise suppression didn't work well when it was trying to suppress my voice on a time delay, but again, this wasn't a fair test. So I called someone. They kept asking if I was there. I kept repeating myself. Apparently, I dropped in and out, and when I wasn't talking, the line was totally silent, without the usual slight background noise that cues the person on the other end that you're still there. I tried calling several different people. I tried adjusting the position of the earpiece. Uniformly, the people I called reported that my voice kept dropping out. I'll be returning my Jawbone tomorrow and resuming my search for a headset that works for me.",negative

"That was my reaction whenever I tried to stick this thing in my ear.

The little nub is somewhere between the size of a nickel and a quarter with absolutely no kind of allowance made for the natural size, shape and construction of the human ear. And the little plastic bit that is supposed to help you get it seated is just a waste of plastic.

"People have already discussed how nice the phone looks and how good the packaging is. What nobody seems to mention are some of the flaws. 1. Periodically the phone will pick up the line after the first ring by itself. This means that it will go off-hook and stay off hook, until I find it. Unfortunately this can be 3 hours or more. 2. The software to make VOIP calls disables the sound card so I have to keep switching it back and forth between my music and speakers and my Calisto VOIP calls. 3. The charger design seems like the contacts on the headset will get corroded from sweat and cease to work. Overall the phone looks nice and works well so far, but the auto answer really takes your phone out of commission until you realize it. 1/30/09 Update About 1 month ago I sent the phone back to Plantronics since the tech support thought it was defective. Well they know this is a piece of junk, since as soon as they hear the model of the phone they sujest a replacement immediately. Unfortunately this is not a game for me and I need to use this as a business phone as well as a Bluetooth for my cell and my Skype headset.

I have tried these pads on a portable hard drive, cell phone, and iPod and each time they work well until they stay behind on the surface. Both sides are pretty equally sticky, so they stay behind on whatever surface they have the best grip on. They work pretty well at first, but over a day or two they tend to pull back off and stay behind on a surface. Another issue is that the edges of the pads tend to curl up, which means that if you try to put them in a bag or pocket the edges of the pad will catch and it will be pulled off.

"Motorola RIZR First blush, day 1: Attractive phone, feels good & sturdy in the hand, buttons are very responsive, slide function is easy to use and graceful, GUI is not exactly pretty but mostly very intuitive. Rather well put together phone. Why'd I get this phone: quad band, Bluetooth, good camera, a music player (or two actually, confusing) which seemed decent in the store. And because it was NOT a flip phone (which I loath), Tmo didn't have a decent candy bar (which I love), and ... it was not a Samsung (take that for what it's worth). Pros: 1. Great camera compared to what I've had (SE T610, Samsung T809) with very strong flash, actually, it's like a flash light. Can I smart button this function anyone? 2. So far, reception is pretty good, antenna stronger than my old & beat up SE t610, and comparable to my Samsung t809 (which broke), but sometimes the call is scratchy or does that computer reverberation like sound (which I've never experienced on my other phones). 3. iTap text message entry is pretty impressive/smart (this is my first Motorola phone). I'm not sure of how it is implemented on other Motorolas but I like it on this one. I miss a few choices of T9 on my SE t610 (w/ Tmo) but iTap is cool. Cons: 1. No timer or stopwatch 2. No analog clock option (but Moto if you're going to design one, make it look like the Nokia analog clock for the 6133 or the s60 menubar clock) 3. No mirror on the back for self pics like many Sony-Ericsson bar phones have 4. Placement of memory card: buy yourself surgical tweezers or hemostats to get this sucker out 5. Mac/Bluetooth/iSync: iSync does not work for me despite having first dl'd an iSync plug in which purports to doing so. With my Samsung this made me irate, but Moto has a good track record with iSync support so I'm waiting. 6. Headset has better mic, so others hear me better even than when I'm using the phone regularly. BUT, there's often (65% of the time) a buzz that either I can hear, or both my caller and I can hear. 7. Cannot access full menu when on a call, only some menu functions (but not text or call recording) 8. Cannot record calls 9. Some functions & settings hard to find (or completely lost) Tmo has crippled this phone in some ways: 1. no MotoReader like the Moto site for the product says (which opens MS docs) 2. the option to save text messages to the SIM card has been removed. Tmo support says they can't control this. Moto says Tmo has removed it and thus controls that aspect. 3. cannot install Java apps like the Moto site says. What? I thought this was MY phone now. Silly consumer, Deutsch Telecom owns it. Comments: 1. screen is tiny compared to others, but still is very resolute and pleasant to look at 2. camera is great, doesn't have as many fun options as my old Samsung t809 (which I really didn't like but which did have lots of ways to play with your pics when taking them like comic bubbles etc) 3. my RIZR was set to display only SIM card contacts when I first got it from Tmo which frustrated me for a while since the phone kept telling me that the newly BT transferred contact was ""outside current view"" 4. I have decided to keep the phone with Tmo despite the drawbacks I've listed. After long term use: 1. key pad lost responsiveness, would not enter some numbers, some numbers would enter two or three times, scrool pad lost sensitivity on one side. 2. after moving on to other phones, the features i miss are - flash light (simple feature, but once gone is missed) - iTap. going back to t9 is painful now! iTap took a little adjustment but once adjusted is far superior",neutral

it serves it purpose by providing a connector piece from the iphone to a regular headset attachment but if you move at all you only get partial sound out of it. i bought it to connect my iphone to my car stereo and it only works part of the time because of the movement factor. i can't use it with headphones at all because i am usually moving around with my headphones on. oh well. you get what you paid for!,negative
"I ordered this one because it is just like the one that was lost in the move, at least I thought it was.

If you want to get the Backwinder (which you can use as a video stand with the clip on back) you probably should order it directly from Marware and pay the money to get what you want and what was advertised on Amazon. After asking if it's worth the hassle to return this for an exchange, I decided to keep it (low cost and very nice, protective rubber) and order the real thing from the actual Marware site.

"I am very pleased with this garlic keeper and would recommend it without reservation. The container is sturdy, made of terracotta, and has a very attractive rustic design on it. There are several holes near the bottom of the container (for aeration, I presume) and those holes are cleverly incorporated to appear to be part of the container's design (the holes are observable in the picture of this product, underneath the picture of the two garlic cloves). The container is several inches tall, just the right size to fit unobtrusively on a kitchen counter, and yet large enough to store several garlics. And, not only is the garlic keeper attractive, it is also very functional. I find that it has prolonged the life of garlic cloves, keeping them from sprouting or rotting unduly early.",positive

"While this piece does what it sets out to do, namely integrating an aftermarket head unit into the factory climate controls and displays, the fit and finish are not exemplary by any means. I've used other Metra kits over the years and most of them are simple radio surround pieces - this is the fist one that necessitated replacing the entire center section of the dash. When doing this install (which was fairly straightforward) I discovered that the piece I received was oversized for my dash by a few millimeters. Consequently it has a tendency to pop out of the dash. Secondly, the chrome stripes from the factory dash piece are missing so the finish is different as well. Thirdly, the hazard button is an awful piece of workmanship using the least expensive version of pushbutton possible. My next step is to see if I can take the electronics from the Metra piece and mount them onto the factory dash piece and work the faceplate in with a bit of bondo, sanding and refinishing for a custom look. It fits, but for the price, I would have liked a bit more precision and workmanship from a company I've come to trust over the years.",neutral
I would of preferred magnets instead of Velcro but it's a nice pouch.,neutral
"Build quality is nice, & I like the way it's designed. If it weren't for 2 problems, it would get high marks. 1st, the mounting solutions were not very workable. I wasn't about to screw into my dash, but I knew this from the start. I had high hopes for the sticky tape, but it didn't hold at all. Maybe that's just because of the texture of the surfaces in my car, or maybe it's just too heavy for sticky tape. Maybe I could have bought some heavy-duty sticky tape & tried to use more, but I found it wedged well between the passenger seat & the center console. If this were the only problem, I would have wanted to rate it a 4.5 because it's a predictable issue. 2nd, the plug never fit very well into the socket, and then it temporarily disconnected & reconnected whenever the car hit a pot hole or bump in the road. Which was very annoying considering it was powering my bluetooth FM transmitter to play music, and the thing would emit a horrible high-pitched beep through the car speakers when powering back up - usually before I could react & mute it. Very frustrating. I realize that car power sockets are not reliably standard in size, so I hate to take off a lot for it...but the point is that in my case it fits...until it blips...and that makes it much less useful. I'm passing it on to someone else in the family to see if they can use it.",neutral

"I've had this phone for over 2 years. It may be stylish and touted as a music phone, but really, music is the last thing you want this phone for. It's excellent at being a -phone-: contacts, ringtones, calendar and TXT are easy to navigate. Otherwise, you'll have to compromise with the phone to get what you want. INTERNAL FEATURES REVIEW: The only way to get music and customizable ringtones are to DL them through Verizon; or to buy a data cable and hack the internal memory with PC apps, which takes a bit of work. As for Bluetooth, this feature is a joke. While you're able to connect to headsets, and even other phones, you are unable to transfer files wirelessly between them. This phone is Vcast enabled which is very cool, but also completely useless in 2 situations: if 1) you don't subscribe to Vcast, or 2) you are in a remote area with only extended coverage (roaming). The phone has some quirks like voice command and audio recorder, but most newer phones do, too. For anything sound-wise, there are 4 possible folders: My Ringtones, My Music, My Sounds, and My MP3s (shows up when you enable MP3s under Services after entering the 6-digit code). My Sounds are useless. You can play or record short clips and that's it. My MP3s is best for utilizing the media player, and My Music is very sketchy - sometimes songs work, sometimes they don't - sometimes they just cut off. My Ringtones has an annoying feature wherein you can't delete prepackaged tones (which are -horrible-). There are a total of 27MB of internal memory and 6.27MB of internal RAM, with an unevenly divided amount allocated between features- PIX/FLIX, 4MB; and Ringtone, 2.02MB. Vcast and apps take up the most memory and will depend on what you DL. I store everything on external memory, speaking of which... EXTERNAL FEATURES REVIEW: External memory is in the form of MiniSD - which has now been replaced by MicroSD, so there is an external memory compatibility issue between the VX8100 and newer phones, such as the Chocolate. The phone looks cool with music player buttons on the front, but they're generally useless. The camera is nothing special at 1.3MP, though it does have flash and a relatively quick shutter speed. The camera is a bit awkward- it has no mirror and the only way to see yourself in the front screen is to close the phone. It also takes low-quality MPEG movies with a limit of 15 seconds. The phone itself is bulky and heavy, but it is very durable; I drop it on the street/sidewalk all the time and though the casing may suffer for it, the phone still works fine. The audio speakers are very decent when playing music and comes with an adjustable synthesizer. The battery it comes with will probably not last longer than a year or so - you will need to buy a new one at about $50. Also, these batteries have a very short life, lasting 1 or two days at best with minimal usage; the phone also has a quick charge time, however. __RATING__ LOOKS: 4/5 DURABILITY: 5/5 CUSTOMIZABILITY: 1/5 MUSIC: 2/5 TXT/CALLING: 4/5 TOOLS/EXTRAS: 4/5 MAINTENANCE: 3/5 MEMORY: 2/5 --OVERALL-- 3/5 WHO SHOULD BUY: Homemakers, Senior citizens, Non-technical professionals, Students.

Cheap construction. It fell apart less than 6 months after purchase with normal use. I purchased this to replace an almost identical stand that I had owned for 7 years.,negative
This is my first bluetooth headset so I really have nothing to compare it to. The quality of sound received is very good but the headset must be placed in your right ear and has a universal earpiece which does not stay secure in my ear. I am very fearful that it will fall out without me noticing it. It is difficult to get the earpiece in the proper position for hearing the caller when there is no way to secure the earpiece in the best position for you. I would not buy this headset again for these reasons.,neutral

I got this to match my pink Razr. After reading some customer reviews on this model I was worried about sound quality. Once I tried it for myself all my worries were put to rest.

"Until recently, this review read that ""I've been very happy with this holster for the past few months. It's worth much more than the $10 I paid for it. I have a Blade and find it works great with this phone model..."" But now I have to edit my review. I still quite like the look and daily function of this product, but am no longer satisfied with its durability. My GF and I have now broken THREE of them. The problem is that the clip is glued into a slot in the leather on the back. Not sewed in tightly, but glued. And the clip (as it should be) is quite strong. So after a few months (for my GF, after just a few weeks) of use, you reach down to take it off at the end of the day, and the holster comes off, but the clip stays on your belt. And unlike Humpty Dumpty, you can't just put them back together again. I liked this product enough that I replaced it twice. But three times is my limit. I won't buy it again. I might as well have bought a really nice ONE for $30-40, now that I've spent that much on three of these.",negative

"Praise: 1. The new PocketMac software for sync-ing Blackberry to Mac is fantastic. 2. The reception is excellent. 3. Battery life is very robust. 4. Screen resolution is better than average. 5.

It's available aftermaket only. 2. The trackwheel is undersized and difficult to roll accurately. 3. Because BlackBerry contracts to info-secure government agencies, the bluetooth doesn't support any data transfer whatsoever. Forget using salling clicker or any other fun/useful bluetooth application. 4. The plastic casing is thin and seems inadequately flimsy to house such versatile, rugged software. Summary: The addition of Mac syncronizing is practical, giving well-designed accessiblity to icalender, address book, and macoffice.

"Here is the lowdown on this product. I have no landline and only use the cell so I am limited to that use in this review. The good: The phone synched easily with my cell phone (LG Dare). Call quality was very good. Not noticably different than just talking on the cell phone. The handset has all the bells and wistles of a good cordless phone. The handset placed and recieved calls through the cell phone perfectly. No issues at all with that functionality. Worked flawlessly. Also the base picks up the bluetooth signal from up to around 25 feet from what i can tell so the cell just has to be nearby but not next to the base. The bad: Once its synched up with the system if you try to place a call (using the cell phone) without pushing the button on the base to unlink it the call will make the wireless phones ring and you will have to pick up one of the handsets to talk to anyone otherwise the person you are calling will not hear you and all you will hear is the remote handsets ringing. Also if you happen to be using your phone and you get within range of the base unit it will ""transfer"" your call to the handset and they will start ringing and you will not be able to continue on your cell phone (really sucks when it happens). Basicly once the bluetooth connection is made to the base your cellphone is only a conduit and cant be used for calling unless you manually hit the button to turn the base off for that particular line. You would then need to push it again to have it connected to the base. Also the manual is not that great. Something else started happening today. If I touch anything on my cell phone the handsets ring and to get them to stop I have to answer them, otherwise they ring in perpetuity. This happens if I go to check a text message. Even just going to turn off the bluetooth makes the handsets ring. I would not recomend this phone if you use your cell for anything more than calling. Summary: If you don't mind having to push the base button to use your cell phone separtely its fine. It would be a fantastic system if it allowed you to make and recieve calls from your cell phone or remote phones without having to manually turn the system on or off when the cell phone is within the bluetooth reception range. If you are content to set your cell down and do all your talking with the handset then this is perfect for you. If someone knows a way to keep the system from calling the handset when you use the cell phone without hitting the button to unlink it from the base then please post it here. Its driving me insane.",negative

"I purchased this headset for use with my Motorola T720. It is not a bluetooth enabled phone, but the cradle that headset comes with makes it compatible with any phone with a 2.5mm headset jack. I have to admit that I was completely astonished with the functionality of this product. It was mediocre at best. I was sitting in my vehicle, with the cradle on my belt, and the headset lost signal. It says it has a range of up to 30ft, but at 5ft it lost signal. The sound quality was good, but without the constant fear of losing signal, I couldn't justify the cost of a wireless headset. A good handsfree kit for the vehicle would cost about the same amount of money without the fear of lost signal.",negative

"i got this powered usb hub mainly because my laptop only has 3 usb ports and no internal disk drive. this allows me to greatly expand the number of ports i can use at my desk without unplugging everything. i have a printer, my wireless mouse charger, my phone charger/usb hookup, ipod charger/hookup, and the external disk drive (which needs 2 ports to get enough power) all hooked up with room to spare for a flashdrive or anything else. the only thing i do not like about it is that it doesnt seem to be able to charge some things without being hooked up to the computer as well. for example my droid phone would only charge from the ports when the hub was connected to my computer, even though the hub was still plugged into an outlet. if would work in this manner it would be a lot nicer, as i did not always have my laptop hooked up when i wanted to use it to charge other electronics. however when its hooked up to the laptop it works perfectly fine in all areas that i need it to, and has made it a lot easier to have many things hooked up on a midsize desk without making a huge mess of loose cords.",positive

"Tell me something, what is the purpose of headphones? To provide quality music which you can hear and which will not bother others. At $50, this set can't even do that. The sound from music from an LG Venus is about a 6 out of 10. Calls and other phone sounds are about a 3 out of ten. What is by far the worst though is that people 20 feet away (perhaps farther) can hear very clearly what is eminating from your headset. The sound will be a distraction to your neighbors in just about every setting. So places where you would most often use them (the library, the airplane etc.) you actually won't be able to without bugging people, and no one wants that. The plastic controls are pretty cheap too.

"(...) This is the first headset I've owned. It paired easily with my T-Mobile Sony-Ericsson T610 phone. Voice dialing works as it should. It doesn't stay on my ear very well, but this is probably me getting used to having a headset. It feels somewhat flimsy, but it is not heavy so that's probably a fair tradeoff. It only has two buttons which perform all functions. There is a delay between when the button is pressed and the phone responds. This could be my phone. It would be nice to have a caller-id display, but this headset does not have that. (...). I would have been disappointed if I spent more than $20 for it.",neutral

"I'm not sure if this is a problem specific to my service area, but my razr phone interferes with many electronics--like my car stereo, television, etc. If I'm watching tv, i can tell when I'm about to get a call BEFORE the phone begins to ring because the tv gets this weird static...same goes for the car stereo. anyone else experience this?

"saw the special deal on amazon so I bought it. The phone is alright but not at all what i was looking for. First of all people should know that the reason the phone is availible so cheap is that it isn't the US edition. Though it doesn't really matter, it is kind of annoying. The charger comes with a universal adapter and won't work without it, making the charger weird shaped and bulky. The other thing is that some of the menus on the phone are spelled wrong. The Good ~Battery life is very impressive ~2mp camera is not bad ~Decently customizable ~Comes with Platinum Sudoku The Bad ~The user interface was my main problem with the phone. Defult analog clock and wrong date format. the menus just don't make sense, things that should take one button to do take 3 or 4. Menus are grouped strangely and things like bluetooth are a pain to find. ~mutimedia is disapointing on almost every level, videos take a while to load aren't great resolution (176X144) max length is 30 seconds ~audio player is ugly and slow, with a just plain bad interface ~doesnt work with MircoSD card, or at least not a full size one, maybe I misread Overall not that bad of a phone, just not made for mutimedia by any standards, I for one will be returning it for the Sony Ericson.",neutral

I purchased this item because it was recommended as an accessory to the Cellet Leather Case I purchased for my iPhone.

"In December 2007 I renewed my AT&T contract and got a Motorola Q9H. Yesterday (Feb 2008), when unplugging the phone from the charger, the charge socket on the phone came right out of the phone - it appears that it is held on by a small amount of solder on the junctions, and the solder joints are dull and look dry. I called my local AT&T store and they said, no problem, there is a 12 month warranty, and I need to call a 1-800 number and they will send out a replacement. So I called the number. They tell me that they will send out a replacement, and I must send in the phone, but should they determine that this is due to ""physical damage"" they will bill me $399, and there is no way to get the old phone back. I asked why I can't send the old phone in without them shipping out a new one and have them call me to tell me whether it is covered under warranty (which is should be; I did not mistreat the phone) and if not, give me a quote to have it repaired. They can't do that, they said. My only options are to decide up front to send it for repair (and pay for the repair), or gamble $399 that they will do the right thing. Obviously the phone is ""physically damaged"" but that is due to a defect, not abuse, so this doesn't sound like a good gamble to me. So I'm left with a broken phone less than 3 months old. It was a nice phone while it worked.",negative

"The first Motorola Krzr K1M(white) I purchased from Verizon lasted less than 3 weeks before many of the functions ceased to work. I was instructed to cycle power on the phone--this worked once. Then many of the functions on the phone ceased to work altogether. Thought I had a defective phone, so Verizon replaced it free. I love the appearance of the phone and its functional setup. With my new phone I was able to transfer music files to the microSD card for about a week. Then the phone would no longer connect to my PC. I reloaded the USB drivers many times and swapped in known good USB cables--all to no avail. My computer would recognize the hardware connect as a Motorola K1M/L7c, but refused to interface with it. I called Verizon and they gave me a software fix via download. This worked for about 3 days, then back to the same thing--whenever I attempted to connect the phone in ""sync"" mode, I would get a ""connection failed"" message on the phone. This appears to be no fluke--2 brand new phones of the same model plus a (known to Verizon, hence the downloadable fix)software glitch. I love the phone--it works great. The video and still camera works great. But the music transfer system is abysmal. My original phone got to the point where it almost seemed as if the Bluetooth functions and the contacts button were inoperative. I also purchased a Motorola Bluetooth headset--it was poorly constructed. Got rid of it and purchased a Plantronics--it works great. I will no longer be purchasing ANYTHING by Motorola! I am going to swap this phone for either an LG or a Samsung--those are products I can trust!",negative
"This little charger works really well, but I do not recommend storing it with the phone's cord plugged in. When the metal on my phone cord's charging end makes contact with the metal border around the charger, it will spark and short the whole thing out. From there, the only way to get the charger working again is to plug it back into the micro-USB charger, which resets everything. Not a huge deal, but the sparks are concerning, and I don't know why the charger even needs that metal border in the first place. It seems aesthetic, and dangerous. I have since stopped storing the charger with a phone cord plugged into it, and only plug the cord in when I am ready to charge my phone. Otherwise, the product is great. I can usually boost my phone 2 or 3 times, which is great when it gets heavy use throughout the day. It does not take long to charge from low to full either.",neutral

"Pros: *The product proved to be designed to tight dimensions, so your HTC Kaiser/ATT tilt will fit snuggly with no gaps. *case has a nice black paint job with a glossy clear-coat added. *The case is made of hard plastic, relatively sturdy & thin, yet it still remains ""pocket-able"" when snapped on the tilt. This design seems to be much better as in being non-invasive than the other metal cases I have looked at. *keyboard function, camera, other buttons, & usb remains unaffected after adding the case. Cons: *Terrible over-spray, the case is actually white plastic which has been painted black only on one side... thus the inside & even some of the visible edges have some black over-spray as well as unpainted areas. This can someone be an eyesore & will be frequently commented on when you let other people use your phone. *using a usb/headphone adapter also offered by amazon has been somewhat of a challenge, the plastic case does not leave enough room for proper insertion of the adapter leading to the adapter to fall out if not held firmly & your music will start playing out of the phone speaker(this problem does not occur if the the phone has no case) *the seller of the item(so far only 1 seller is here for this case) took 4 days longer than the last arrival date stated by amazon. In other words it took over 2 weeks from order completion to receiving the product in hand.

This made it so I had 5 bars (max of 5) whenever I already had 3 or 4. However, it didn't seem to do anything whenever I had just 1 or 2 bars, which is disappointing because that's when you need it. I used it for a bit and tried it in various places, and it didn't seem to do much for me. I can't definitively say for sure it wouldn't help it other's situation.

"I set this up in the mini-van in my driveway. Immediately upon attaching the phone, I became hopeful that this product would be great. My phone went from three bars to five. A great sign that this product does what it claims. Unfortunately, that's the most positive thing I can say about it. The negative feelings started with the installation. With a Honda Odyssey, the ideal configuration is to have the antenna go out through the one of the rear windows. Unfortunately, the cable is not long enough to do that unless you want it hanging across the center of your cabin. Should work fine on a coupe, sedan or pickup truck, or if you run the cable out one of the forward windows. The magnet on the base of the antenna is pretty strong, though I do wonder how it would have stood up to the nine feet of snow we got in this vicinity over the past few months. Because I was not happy with some of the other factors, I didn't bother to mount it to the dashboard. I would have been hesitant to do so in any case since it mounts with a large adhesive pad. I would prefer a suction mount or a dashboard beanbag. Unless you have the ability, I would recommend professional installation. All that said, if the performance were exceptional, it would be worth it for many who live on the edges of excellent cell coverage. As I mentioned, I was hopeful at first use, but alas, it didn't stand the test I set out for it. There is a five mile stretch near my home that has iffy coverage. When I was a Verizon customer, I never successfully transited that stretch without dropping a call. Upon joining Sprint recently, I have driven it twice without a drop. Today, the calls dropped quite readily while connected to the weBoost. I pulled my phone free while driving through that area, the bar level improved, and I was able to again connect a call. While doing this, I noted another troubling issue. The metal connector where the antenna attaches to the base was quite warm to the touch. I don't know if this is normal, but it wasn't something I'd expect. I will say that I plugged my Galaxy S5 into the device with the Otterbox cover on it. Removing the case might improve the performance, but such a requirement would make the product unusable for my purposes. It might be suitable for a traveling business person who spends a lot of time on the road in mediocre coverage areas, but it isn't worth the trouble for me. With high cost, an imperfect installation and iffy performance, I can't recommend this product.",neutral

I have been using one of these for over a year. It is comfortable and fits very well.

One more thing keep in mind, Amazon is the only place to shop and ONLY what is shipped DIRECTLY from Amazon and not from Affiliates because if you have any problem they send you a brand new one overnight and they don't wait for you to send the defective one first also you have 30 days return policy and the best and easiest way to shop.",negative

Sure the phone looks cool but the V3xx razor blows this thing away specification wise. Why the Goforce 4800GPU was not included in this phone is beyond me. Also why is there a measly 66mhz processor in this when the V3xx/Maxx have a 247mhz(Arm9)? The screen is a smaller resolution QCIF compared to the QVGA of the V3xx too. I mean the only upside I could see it the 2MP camera on this phone. It also only supports EDGE which the V3xx supports the much faster 3G HDSPA/UMTS. If you are big on fashion and not specs then this is the phone for you. A much better phone would be the V3xx 3G phone or wait for the Krazr K3. One last not why is this thing still called a razr?

My only other complaint (minor) is that the phone doesn't come with a ""generic ring"" ringtone.

It is hard to adjust the volume while in use. Your fingers may tend to slipped while trying to adjust. Even the call button is difficult to press.

"In general, it performs as it claims... The only qualms i have with the software is that i don't seems to be able to drag and move the map around the screen... I am not sure whether i didn't read the manual fully or this is a feature of the software... When i was using another version of GPS software, it actually allows me to drag and move the map around. I find this feature very useful especially when the GPS signal is lost and i try to use it as a normal map. I hope that in the future, Garmin can change it to a 4GB or larger memory card. 2Gb nowadays is very small... Also, if cost permits, Garmin can throw in a quick guide booklet into package. It is good of them to assume that people who buy such products are GPS savvy but the learning curve in terms of using the software would be much more gentle with such material available. Before you go and buy this, do check with Garmin whether it supports your PDA phone. You can email them and they usually reply in a few days time. Their website is not updated with the latest GPS phone so it is better to check with them directly. Thats about it. Have fun!",positive
"Worked great for 12 months, but that was it. Now, it stops charging after just a couple minutes and the LEDs flash, then shut down. Unfortunately the product warranty is only 10 months. The New Trent website does not make it easy to contact them, and you have no chance of a warranty claim even within the warranty period unless you register within 15 days of purchase...doesn't seem like a company that really stands behind their product. It worked great, but 12 months doesn't cut it for me. I'll try a product from Anker instead.",negative

"I live in a low lying ""dead zone"" which made it virtually impossible to reliably communicate with anyone via cell phone - am I'm talking on the major networks like Verizon and AT&T. Since I have installed this system, I now get FOUR BARS in the room where I've placed the antenna and 2-3 bars throughout the rest of the house. Yes it's a bit of work to install - you need to mount the receiving antenna on the outside of your house and then string the cable either through your attic or basement - but it works incredibly well once you've got it in place.

It is light, slim and fits in my front pants pocket. It is very easy to type and download email, check my calendar, news, etc. It is top-notch for managing my work and family life.

"Overall, I would recommend this product but it could certainly be much better. I've found it useful enough times that I'd bet you'd get your money's worth out of it. Just be prepared to get frustrated on occasion. Pros: 1. The sound quality is better than I expected. It's not amazing and other reviews have given accurate assessments of the sound, but there's only so much you can expect out of a little portable. It's certainly good enough to have around the pool or campfire. 2. Sturdy and nice looking form factor. This isn't some cheap little plastic thing with mismatched parting lines and flimsy connectors. Cons: 1. Annoying to pair. I'm really sick of critical functionality being buried inside of a single button. Changing the action of a button depending on how long you press it and what intermittent feedback you get back is just dumb. Charge a few extra dollars and put dedicated buttons. Oh, and label them for the hard-of-thinking (ie, make sure you've got it working before you break out the drinks). 2. The case has no spot for the cable. For any real length of time, you're going to need to have the ac adapter plugged in. Unfortunately the form fitting bodyglove-ish case has no way to store it. I've left it in the wrong bag, rendering it useless, at least 3 times. 3. Short range. Perhaps I really was pushing the useful limits of blue-tooth for streaming audio but I felt like you could only have it as far away as you might with an audio cable you might have lying around. Of course, you would then have a cable running through what is likely to be a high traffic area... so I still prefer the wireless option. 4. Annoying to use on Windows Vista. After the hassle of pairing it the first time, you still have to enable the connection, shut down the program that will stream the audio, go to playback devices, switch your primary to the M1 headset, reopen the program to play the audio...",neutral

"I've had this phone for about 2 weeks now, and I'll have to say that I've been very happy with it. I've recently switched from SprintPCS to Tmobile, where I was using the sanyo 8100, a very similar flip camera phone (another excellent phone). It's a real eye catcher, very sleek and stylish. The user interface is easy to use and understand, and navigating from one screen to the next is pretty quick compared to some other samsung phones. Although the screen on this phone is probably the best among all the samsung phones, i feel that it is inferior to the screen on my Sanyo 8100, where the colors were a little more bright and vivid. The camera is excellent expecially with the flash, brightness adjustment, digital zoom, and all the other available options. One thing that my sanyo did that my new samsung cant do, is edit photos after they have been taken...but no biggie, i can live with it. The E715 is small the slim, and is hardly noticable when in my pocket. I love that there is no antenna, and the included head set is just as attractive and functional. The Self Portrait feature comes in very handy, and is great feature. The infrared port on the phone seems to be useless, so getting a data cable is recommended (it's cheaper to get them on ebay as apposed to getting them at large electronic retailers such as best buy or circuit city). The battery life right now is not that great (probably due to the juice draining features...camera, flash, etc.) but if u charge every night, you'd be fine. I'd recommend getting a car charger (try and find a retailer who will throw one in for free). But let's wait and see how the charge holds after a few months of use. The polyphonic ringer on the phone is excellent they sound clear and sharp, but too me the included ringtones attract a little too much attention...i wish it came with a little more ""normal"" ring tones. The E715 is a light show you can fit in your pocket. You can change the service light to be various different colors, or have it not blink at all. If you hold down the side volume button while the phone is closed, you can use the flash as a flashlight (It's been very helpful several times trying to get around in a dark room). The service light will also change colors in rhythym with the ringtone melody. Text messaging on ths phone is easy all though, I think Samsung could have made it easier getting to comma's, exclamation, and questions marks on the key pad. The included message alert tones are fun. Over all this is a fantastic phone, probably one of the best on the US market right now, especially if you are more concerned about form over function Summery - Pros: Small and Sleek Great Camera and camera options and settings Easy User interface and quick (enough) navigation through screens No Antenna Great sounding ringer..nice and loud. Strong Vibrate Lot's of included memory ( 9 mb ) Fun lights Cons: Useless infrared port Not the greatest battery life. Text messaging interface is not the easiest I've used.",positive

Until we got the zboost set up we could not get service at all in the house. This is not good because I have clients trying to reach me on my cell phone.

By setting up the zboost in my office with the antenae at the hightest peak of a catherdral ceiling. I am now able to get one and sometimes two bars inside sitting at my desk with the amplifier next to me. If you can put your antenae outside it works much better.

"This is a great product, but it isn't assembled correctly. Luckily, there's an easy way to fix tour turbo charge with a piece of aluminum foil. First, open up the battery area and find the battery contact that's covered by a piece of plastic with half a circle cut out of it. This contact doesn't work because the bumps on the metal behind the plastic isn't directly lined up with the half circle. To fix the problem, take a bit of aluminum foil about 1X4 inches and fold it over both ways to make a long strip. Size doesn't really matter that much. Next, bend the two ends and put the strip into the end of the battery compartment (without springs) so that it lines the wall and blocks both metal contacts. Now, put the batteries in, but push the springs in more so that the batteries pin the strip to the wall but don't move it out of place. You can now put the battery cover on and the charger should work. This works because the metal at the end of the battery case only has the job of connecting the two batteries. If it didn't work, check that the ends of both batteries are touching the foil. Also check that the foil is at the side of the battery case without springs and that the batteries are aligned the right way (one of the batteries has the positive end touching the spring unlike most battery cases). If that didn't work, then the problem with your charger wasn't the contacts at the end of the battery case.",neutral

"I dig the concept. I use the iGo system for all my mobile devices, and it's great for the most part. But inevitably, these particular plugs stop working for some reason, differentiating them from the other tips in the system. Some last longer than others, but I've replaced these a few times over the last few years. I use them in the car for my phone, mostly, so they get a fair bit of use - perhaps plugging and unplugging about once per day on average, and that's considerably more than, say, my iPod power tip. I'm a DIY type that insists on fixing things until they just refused to be fixed anymore, and even I can't bring these back when they poop out. It seems connectivity stops happening inside the unit, either because they bend slightly out of shape or short out. Sometimes the wiggle method keeps them somewhat functional for a little while, but then they deteriorate into only being functional when you prop them or hold them *just so* to keep the charge running - and that's a serious pain in the ascending colon to be futzing with while driving. There are tiny metal prongs on the inside of the plug that disappear or flatten out, and that seems to be the problem, but even getting in there with a tiny tool and reshaping them doesn't seem to help. Opening up a dead one didn't yield any insight either. They are cheap. That's a plus. And they are part of a neat system that minimizes all the peripheral pluggage. But I'm morally opposed to the continual replacement of cheap plastic and electronics and feeding the landfills with e-waste. Even though these are tiny, they contribute to that problem, so you may want to hold out on this particular type of mini-usb for the iGo unless you can differentiate between one that is made better and one that is not - which is something that I haven't been able to determine just yet. There do seem to be different model numbers for the same type of plug though, so more research is necessary.",neutral

"I've used this about two weeks now. It's great looking and durable. It stays put and works fine with eye glasses. The sound of the person you're talking to is great, perfect.

Not every face is the same and it's almost impossible to get it to actually touch my jaw and stay in place. I've tried every ear loop that comes with it. I just can't get it to fit right and that causes it not to do it's best work. Moreover, when you are talking, the volume is always too low. So you attempt to get the volume higher and by doing so you disconnect the call in many cases. I probably would not buy it again and maybe I should have returned it.

"What can I say that haven't been said already? This is an unfortunate product. It actually has the best ""thumbpad"" design of all convergence/communicator devices currently available -- the keyboard simply can't be beat. The user interface is also consistent and easy to learn.

Get this: some people snicker at this being a toy but this ""toy"" can load a webpage in the background while you read email in a separate application, something that a far more expensive Treo 650 can NOT do. The voice quality is decent, not quite as good as other mobile phones but better than other ""convergence"" devices that I've used. Now the bad news. This device relies on ""backend"" servers running by Danger, Inc, the designer of the Sidekick products. These servers, not operated by T-Mobile, were extremely unreliable, rendering Sk2 pretty much useless. This issue is in addition to T-Mobile's already spotty wireless coverage. To give you an idea, in february 2005, there was a complete outage to all sidekick users that affected some for as long as a week (I was one of them).

"The Aliph Jawbone worked quite well in reducing noise being transmitted. Because the earbuds tend to slip out(I tried them all, and none out them was a great fit), one must gently hold the earpiece against the face for maximum effect. The reception sound quality is inferior to my Jabra BT350 and JX-10, I also have. I have a much harder time understanding the other caller with my Jawbone. I didn't find that the noise cancellation feature worked at all on the reception end. The killer for me is the battery life. I have had my Jawbone for just over a year, and the battery is toast. I charge it until the light turns white, and then it lasts about 30 seconds before giving a low battery warning. Since it is a sealed unit, there is no way to fix it.

Both my Jabras allow me to redial my last number dialed by simply holding down the main button for a couple of seconds. If I try this with the Jawbone, it simply shuts off. The lack of easily accessible volume control is also annoying. Aliph sacrificed utility for style, a trade I don't think was worthwhile.",neutral

"This is now the 7th bluetooth headset I've owned and it is far and away the best in terms of quality of call. All the others I've used will start to crackle if I put my phone in my pocket; some drop quality if I hold the phone or place any part of my body between the phone and the earpiece. Because of its size the microphone on the Samsung WEP200 is set far back on the cheek. Despite this challenge, the unit still manages to pick up my voice clearly. I receive fewer complaints from those I call. Unfortunately, the compact design appears to severely affect the battery potential. After 10 months of moderate use, the serviceable charge time of my Samsung has dropped from disappointing to worthless. If turned on but not used, the battery will last up to 22 hours. If used to make calls, the charge my last as long as 8 full minutes on a good day. This translates to a maximum of about 2 calls per charge. Often, I have to switch a call back to the phone to avoid losing power and possibly dropping the call. This is a major detraction from the overall value of a ""hands-free"" device.",neutral
"I've been wondering for quite some time, why I can't find a decent Bluetooth headset for a decent price (I've purchased 3 so far, this being the third). I am very frugal (you may swap that word for cheap if you like) and I like bargains. Buying bargain Bluetooth headsets has it's disadvantages, one being that they don't work well. This is not true of the LG-HBM-760. This headset has very strong reception with my LG Voyager phone without crackling. The sound quality is great, sounds better than the headset on the phone. While making calls, I'm told I sound great as well (no muffling effect). That is all I want. I don't want special bells and whistles, just clear sound when I'm driving in my very old and loud automobile. I haven't tried the headset yet in a windy environment, so I can't tell you how that behaves, but I don't plan on using my Bluetooth headset when I'm walking or jogging, only when I'm driving. Overall, Great product from LG. Pros: Nice and easy fit over the ear. Easy pairing process Easy to make calls Quick charging Very clear sound quality on both ends Cons: Takes a while to turn on and off",positive
"I've been reading everyone's reviews and like many, I love the way it's designed. Battery life is great and it's quick to charge. It's lovely to look at and easy to use. But my range sucks. If I go a few feet away, I always run teh risk of losing my call because of a weak signal. I rarely use the headpiece now because of that unless I'm washing dishes and need my hands to be free. I love it...just wish I could be on one side of my apartment and leave my phone on the other and still be able to use the headset.",neutral
"Overall, this phone functions OK. The reception is good, and voice quality (both ways) is good. However, this phone is only useful if you set all volume controls to maximum. Even then, the volume levels are just ""adequate"". It's more full-featured than any handset I've ever owned. Having THREE fully programmable alarm clocks is especially useful. I also like having multiple phone number fields for each ONE contact, though I don't understand why there are two ""mobile"" phone fields and only one ""home"" phone field. (the opposite would be more useful) Talk time is about two hours and ""standby"" is 3-4 days, in actual use. Both LCD displays are good quality, but it really needs a brightness control, as black shows up as light gray (brightness is too high and can't be adjusted). It does have a contrast control, but white level is fine, so the contrast control is kind of useless. The LCD displays themselves seem to be really high quality, so it is disappointing that they are improperly adjusted. (the image quality COULD be outstanding, if properly adjusted) I don't like that a whole section of the menu is devoted to ""Get It Now"", though Verizon probably insisted on those useless money wasters. (can't fault LG for that) Other than that, the menu system is pretty easy / less cluttered than some handsets I've used. The camera functions OK. The quality of pictures is terrible, but about the same as any other camera phone. If you want pictures, use a digital camera! I mainly like the camera portion of the phone for emergency use. For example, it is a good idea to carry a disposable camera in the car for car accidents. But if you have a camera phone, that's just as good. (emergency use) And if you are ONLY going to send photos to other camera phones, the photos will look good. Forget about using them outside the camera though, as they are low resolution and low quality (just like all camera phones) One nice thing about this camera is that it has a built-in flash (if you enable it), but it would only be good for really short distances, like 6 feet or less. One major gripe I have about this handset is that there is no external indication that the phone is actually ON. There is an LED by the antenna, but this only lights up during phone conversations. (WHY???) If the little LED was on all the time or blinking, it would not affect battery life at all (that you'd notice, anyway). You can set the backlight of the front LCD display to ""ALWAYS on"". That would give you an external indication that the phone was on. But if you did that, you'd have to charge the phone about twice a day. (!) My wife bought these phones (two of them) and we'll probably keep them. If I'd have known what I know now though, I'd have probably picked something different. The handset has buttons RIGHT where you hold it on BOTH sides of the phone, making it very difficult to hold. And if you are left-handed (I'm both), you simply can not hold this phone, as the buttons (which are ACTIVE during phone calls) are right under your thumb. What a stupid design. If there's going to be buttons on the side, it should be on the side of the flip-up part, NOT the part that you hold!!!",neutral

"Firstly, I need to preface this review by saying that I am not very good with electronics. When I buy a phone I care about 3 things 1) weight/size 2)clarity of voice 3) appearance. This phone got 3 out of 3!! The phone is user friendly and adorable. Therefore, I love it. I can't relate to any of the other complaints regarding this phone. I had it for 10 months now, and it never let me down, despite dropping it twice. Yesterday, I dropped it into a puddle and it stopped working. I took it to Verizon, and they gave me a new one, with no issues at all. It's an adorable phone, works better than another other cell phone I have ever had, and has excellent reception.",positive
The sound is tinny and doesn't seem loud enough even with the headset and phone both on max volume. I drive a truck for a living and don't really think I will be able to hear adequately with these in a working environment.

It's a little bulky and sticks out a lot. Also I can't wear it while wearing my Oakley sunglasses. I'm definitley going to return it. When it works, it works good, but that just doesn't happen often enough.",neutral
"I did a lot of research before I got this phone (directly from VWireless). I still don't understand why the black W755 has much higher user ratings on Amazon, so I averaged them and decided it must be basically a 4-star phone. Wrong. I've had it for five months now and Verizon has replaced the battery once and the phone once and it still has terrible battery life. I'm a light user and it's almost all for regular phone use. I rarely text and never use the internet. I wanted good reception, good sound quality, reliability, Bluetooth, and buttons made for phone dialing -- not texting. It's hard to find phones that don't have tiny little buttons these days. I basically got this one for free. I didn't have much choice in my ""price range"" but you get what you pay for. Pros: - Good reception. I get a strong signal almost everywhere. Dead zones on my old phone are greatly reduced. - Nice inside display for the price range but the outside one is pretty tiny. (Guess that's a pro and a con.) - It's purple:) Cons: - Battery life is beyond terrible. Be prepared to purchase an extended-life battery. I have to charge it at least every 48 hours even if it doesn't get used at all. I've had the battery go from just charged down to one bar with just a 45-minute voice, not speaker or Bluetooth, call. Forget about using the music player or you'll drain it totally. - Incoming voice quality is poor. So far nobody's complained about how I sound but I'm not impressed with how calls sound on my end. - Scratches easily. - Even though the keys are big and well-lit, they're flat and have no space in between keys which means you still have to look to dial. The rest of the complaints I have are probably true of most phones in this price range (like the camera is pretty bad) or specific to Verizon's intentionally messed-up software and sometimes abysmal customer service. The jury is still out on the phone reliability issue. It started garbling the sound on some calls and had to be replaced after four months. If it happens again I'll demand a different model. If Verizon didn't have superior coverage I'd never stay with them. Next time I'll pay more up front and go with a no-contract plan. Getting locked into this phone and an overpriced contract for two years was a disappointment.",neutral

"T505 is an excellent product in its category. It frees your hands for safe driving; connects automatically to the mobile phone once turned on.

Motorola can do better in speech recognition capability. The on/off switch could be made easier. I don't regret buying it. I now enjoy music from my iPhone through the car speakers.

I can deal with it since it was not very expensive, but it makes me think this is actually a knock-off or clone to a body glove.

"The case is very rugged and fits perfectly in your hand. I love this case! I'm going to use it all the time but it may be an item you use when going to the beach, traveling or camping. I'm not using the plastic protection for the keys or display because I found it cumbersome to move the track ball and type on the keys. I will use it when needing water / rain protection. I usually carry around my Blackberry and do not normally use the belt carrier. I'm using that for the most part in my car (secondary visor) when traveling although it does work nicely for hanging on a pocket or belt. If you are wanting to carry it around on your belt, you may want to opt for a nice leather case instead. I'm digging the yellow and black color but you may want to go for solid black if you don't want it to stand out. I wish I could still dock it but that's a small price to pay for great protection.",positive

Definitely recommend this.",positive

"If you purchase a cphone service, it can be a pain to hold onto the contract for 2 years. But really if you notice problems soon after buying the phone, cancellation is still an option.

"From the description and the HIGH reviews, it seemed like a great product. However in this case, the LOW reviews seem to be the most correct.

I did contact support and a few days after not hearing from them I went ahead and packed up the device and dropped it in the mail the day support wrote me back. Support said my phone was the problem and not the device. They also said they had numerous reports about my samsung phone not being supported. However, my motorla blue tooth phone did not work and better with the device. They also said it may have been due to excessive road noise from my vehicle.

Out of all of the items I have purchased from Amazon thorughout the years this is the only one that I am dissapointed with.

I tried keeping it in my side pocket, in my backpack, in my backpack's water bottle pouch and in a cellphone specific pocket in my cargo pants. The only I was able to get it to stay consistently connected was by wedging the phone between this charged and my kindle, with my kindle on the outside of my pocket so that there was very little chance of any non-flat surface from touching the adapter. If the charge cable had been less bulky or had a tighter fit in my phone charge port I doubt this would have been an issue. Another issue I have is that the frustrating micro-sd adapter has broken after about 40 charging sessions.

"Undoubtedly the best Bluetooth headset I have ever owned, everyone I speak with has told me that it sounds like I am on a landline. Easy to use and holds a charge longer than my previous headset (Motorola 700). I work from home and am on my cell phone most of the day conducting meetings. The conference call sound quality is incredible, I have had multiple office locations linked through my phone (Cingular 3125 Phone) using this headset and everyone could hear me crystal clear. Some have said the on/off button was difficult, however I find it to be and intelligent design. It is in a location that makes it nearly impossible to accidently turn it off, while on a call. The volume control is easy to use and the over all sound and volume quality is excellent. The only down fall is that it is so comfortable to wear that you forget it's on your ear, I nearly wore it in to the shower. It also has a wind reduction feature that works great outdoors.

I have lived in a place where our water pressure was like a fire hose blasting at you and I must say, there is nothing I miss more than that type of water pressure. I bought the exact same shower head my old place had hoping I can get the same pressure but no luck. It wasn't even close. Then I ran into this shower head at our local fair and it looked impressive in their demos. I was very hopeful to get the same result when I get myself one. I got this here for $70 cheaper by the way than what they were selling it for at the fair. I am very satisfied. It didn't have the pressure like it was in the demo but It was still many times better than my old shower head. Even with the pressure being mediocre there was so much water coming out that it was still very effective and gives a shower I haven't had in years. I didn't install the flow saver (I need all the help I can get). A house with better pressure than mine should be even better and might get a massaging type performance out of it. I don't get that at my house but I do get much more water flow than before which is so nice and relaxing. If I was to change 2 things about this product, I wish they had an option with chrome or brushed metal look. It doesn't match the rest of my bathroom but the performance is worth sacrificing the look. Also I wish it was little bit easier to change the head location. It has many options in how you can position it but it is a bit stiff to reconfigure. I can see some females (my wife) having a bit of a hard time changing its positioning which will result in being lazy to use it at it's best. My wife loves washing her long hair with this specially because it can be positioned low, close and even behind her head. She is less than 5 ft tall and can go low enough to have it just above her head (even touching her head). I hope this helps you. I would buy this again no problem unless it breaks with in a short period of time. Seems solid though and so far so good. Gave it a 4 only because I wish it did give me more pressure like the demo had.",positive

I bought this for my son for use with his PS3 for online gaming with friends. I have also begun using it with my cellphone while at work. Pairing the headset to both the PS3 and my Motorola cellphone was a piece of cake. Reception is great...sound is clearer in the headset than my cellphone. Very comfortable. My son commented that he sometimes forgets he's wearing it. I've noticed the same thing. We're very happy with this purchase. I'll probably get another one that is dedicated to my cell phone and let my son keep his. Highly recommended.,positive

Very nice phone but it is Tri band not quad band. T-mobile has degraded this excellent phone by removing the 850 band from the T-mobile v600. The ATT and Cingular v600's are quad band. You can choose the bands you want on the menu of the phone. Why would T-mobile remove it so you can't use it? For roaming or future use delibrately removing a band from a quad band phone is not in the customer's interest.,neutral
"I got this one a month ago from t-mobile. 99+tax. Had to take a data plan as well with this(they made me take it). Blackberry Maps are totally awesome on this, but they would work only if you have a data plan(atleast 19.99 a month). Pearl has stunning looks and its way better in terms of weight, functionality compared to the other Blackberry models. However, one day after using it for 5-6 days, it won't ring anymore, no sound at all. No music, no rings, no keypad sound, nothing. I had to spend a lots of time on the internet to figure out that, i have to take the battery out and put is back in to get its sound back. I did and it worked. But then the same problem again. It was not worth the money and a 2 year contract. So went back to t-mobile and returned. THings to watchout for. No OEM case/cover available. Keys get presses easily. Body is not that strong, can easily crack. 1.3 MP Camera is mediocre. And the keypad is really uncomfortable, esp to those who have used the simple ABC types before. I would say, that people wait for some more time, till all its accessorries are out and they upgrade the software or whatever, to make this sound problem(i heard the same from some others as well) go away.",neutral

I took the advice of the PVC pipe about 8 feet above my roof, ran the cable and put the base unit in my attic. It worked like a champ on the first try. It didn't take long to install at all for a guy that is not very handy to begin with. Now I have 3-4 bars in my house and my wife's old school phone have 5 bars all the time.

"I have owned two models of the Scala and a Jabra. All of these worked fine in a quiet environment. Only the Jawbone works well with background noise. But this alone isn't enough for me to award 5 stars -- that came from unexpected resilience. Upon placing the Jawbone on the kitchen counter, I inadvertently brushed it off and it fell directly into my dog's water bowl. Bummer! I saw $80 flashing before my eyes. I rescued it quickly and shook the excess water off. It proceeded to flash multiple colors reminiscent of the alien spacecraft in ""Close Encounters,"" then shut itself off. Crap. I placed it in a sunny window to evaporate excess moisture. Two hours later, I tried to turn it on -- success! It coupled with my phone and has been working fine ever since. This is unbelievable resilience.",positive

"Excellent phone. Unique software architecture which is quite a departure from the style and format of Sprint PCS phones which was my previous carrier. My only issue is that the various menu interfaces are not as intuitive as sprint phone software menue interfaces. I have still much to learn and explore as far as phone functionality go but fortunately Cingular blesses you with a very detailed phone manual which Sprint was always negligent in providing such detail in their paperbound manuals. There are many charts and quick-guide cheat sheets in the manual which make for easy hunt and peck assistance with phone functions another quality lacking in Sprint. By the way, though my previous phone was blue tooth I had never used a headset with the device. It is truly wonderful to have both hands free and to even be a dozen feet away from your phone while making and answering calls. I love bluetooth, get a headset and put it to use, you won't regret it, especially if you like to be fully functional with your hands while having on the go conversations.",positive

I found the unit relativley easy to install and was able to get green LED's which indicated proper set up according to the instruction manual. The signal at the booster transmitter gave me 5 bars on my AT&T cell phone as long as I held the phone within 12-24 inches of the booster. At 3 feet the signal at the phone dropped to 3 bars and at 10 feet it dropped to 1 bar. I returned the booster as I was getting no signal increase when sitting at my desk only 12 feet from the unit.,neutral

"Overall the phone is pretty good for what it is. A budget wifi capable smart phone. The look style and feel of the phone is great, the headphones broke within a couple weeks and were not very good to begin with. The button never worked well and one speaker quit in about a week. The jack ended up breaking off. The ear pieces never fit well and the volume was not very loud. My next complaint is about the speaker in the phone itself. When the volume is turn up to an adequate level the speaker vibrates against the printed circuit board and creates a buzzing noise. I had to take the phone apart and place a small piece of thin rubber between the speaker and the board to get it to stop. Works well now. I would still recommend this phone if you want to save money and you want to have the wifi capability to go online occasionally.",neutral

"I bought these to use on my Macbook Pro, so that I could use VOIP as well as listening to music when I'm working without having to worry about cables. While it certainly does fine in the VOIP front, where sound quality isn't really important, it is an utter failure as a set of headphones for listening to music. The music comes through as if you were on a cell phone and the person you were talking to was holding their phone up to a radio.

I certainly wasn't expecting them to sound as great as a good pair of headphones, but I was completely disappointed, music sounds about as good as listening to them on a dirt cheap set of wired headphones.",neutral

Otherwise, I have been using it for over an year now, the connectivity is fool proof and so is charging the phone through the USB.

I place the antennae/cable upside down so the holder strap goes in the middle. Others have said they don't like that because the on/off button is inside the pack that way. The transmitter fits very snug so once it's in it's not going anywhere!

I cannot be more than 3 feet away from the phone or it becomes very static-y and drops calls. The distance between my purse in a shopping cart (where my phone is) and me pushing the cart is too far. If its on my lap or in my pocket its fine. But as soon as I cross that 3 foot distance mark, it breaks up so badly I cannot understand what others are saying. They can still hear me just fine--but I cannot hear them. Now about the fit. I work as a customer service rep out of my home, so I wear a headset pretty much the whole day. This one is comfortable--for about an hour. Then my ear starts to ache. I don't have that problem with higher quality headsets. I am returning this to try a Motorola.

"I lost my Samsung 410 headset a couple of weeks ago (it's small and when it goes in a pocket, it tends to redial the last number, a real annoyance), and I was faced with getting another. I got this one at Best Buy for $60 (lesson: shop Amazon) to try out. I reasoned that Samsung had probably made some engineering progress since I paid $80 for the 410. The 350 did have some noise reduction (less complaints about ambient noise when driving), but some was still there. What caused me to return the 350 was: 1: Miserable bluetooth reception. I had to have the phone on the same side of my body as the earphone, and many times it got scratchy until I pulled the phone out of my pocket and got it within 2 feet of my earpiece. Not all the time, but way too often. Unacceptable. (I use a Razr phone) 2: It fell out of my ear a lot. The 410 came with a variety of rubber earpieces so one would fit well and not come off, but the 350 comes with one size only. I know it comes with a wire earhook, but I don't like to use one. This limits my headset choices a lot, mostly to Samsung. I'm currently back with the 410, whose problems are, to me at least, more acceptable.",neutral

"This is just a very cheap version of a field strength meter for detecting Electromagnetic fields. That is what EMF stands for. I have had one of these for over 20 years and this meter is at the bottom end of the scale. I laugh when I see these ghostbusters using these meters to impress people. It is nothing more than a toy which is now overpriced and does not read nuke radiation. When I first bought this exact meter, it was only $29. So that should give you an idea on the gouging involved. Here is how that works (in basic lay terms): All electrical devices produce electromagnetic fields when they are powered on and pulling electrical current. The meter registers how strong the EM field is for such devices. The more current the device uses... the higher it will register on the meter. Things like microwave ovens, toasters, high voltage power lines, TV tube type sets... anything that pulls a lot of power will register high. This meter does NOT read radiation (which comes in many forms). It will not read alpha, beta or gamma ionizing radiation such as from nuclear sources. It will not read RF (radio frequency... such as microwaves). What it is reading from your microwave oven is the Electromagnetic field produced by the electrical current and power transformer in your microwave. It reads the strength of electrical fields. Nothing else. The reason the meter will register at walls and various areas of the house, is because it is reading the Electrical wiring in the walls which has AC current flowing through them. These are not ghosts in the walls despite what these [...]might have you believe. It is reading the fields from electrical power being pulled through that location. It is easy to test, just shut off the main AC breaker to your house. Shut all of your power off and then you can see how those so called ""Hot spots"" will disappear. The meter only registers electrical fields... despite what these goofy people might have you believe. Some sections of electrical wiring in your walls will register higher because anytime the wiring is compressed, it will cause heating at that point. This is often caused by the AC wiring being compressed by the Staples used to fasten the AC wiring to the wood framing inside the walls. This heating from compression often causes destruction of the insulation on the wiring... but it is not a ghost. You may also be reading a point where more than one electrical wire converge. This is not a statement as to the existence of ghosts... but this is a statement about this meter and what it can and cannot read. It may be exciting to see the meter fluctuate at a wall, but it is nothing more than electrical current you are reading in the wiring at that particular point in the wall. As I said, shut off all the power to the house with the main breaker and you will see how it will go away. However, keep in mind, if you are dealing with a crook who is trying to make you believe they have a magic way of detecting spirits with a cheap field strength meter... they are also capable of using tricks to fool you by using little devices hidden in your home or in their pocket... to set off the meter. You should also know that those polaroid films can be multiple exposed with various images. They can be exposed more than once. My father used to do multiple image exposures on those as a hobby. He could expose more than 4 separate images on a polaroid film. A unique feature of polaroid film. You can also expose images on ""sealed"" film still in a package. So if someone uses a polaroid and shows you some ""image"" on the photo which wasn't there in the room, it is quite likely the image was preexposed by the person associated with the film and camera. Either way, just know that this meter only detects electrical fields. The more current the appliance pulls and the larger the power transformer, the higher it will register. This particular meter is the cheapest, bottom of the barrel meter you can buy... but a great toy for lay people who have no familiarity with electrical fields.",negative

"First the pros: It works reliably, seems to have a long battery life, withstands abuse from my 1-year old, microphone picks up my voice well Now the cons: The on/off switch is extremely difficult to press. You have to press it down and hold it down with significant force to turn it on. This is especially annoying when you put it on you ear, not realizing it's off. Then you try to turn it on w/o having to remove it from your ear, but are unable to do so since such force it required. So you have to take it off to turn it on, then put it back on your ear. This happens to me all the time. I first put it on my ear, and then realize I have to turn it on. what a pain. The earpiece does not go far enough into the ear (maybe it'll fit your ear better though). My ear is a normal average adult male ear (I think), and I really wish I could put the speaker closer to my ear hole/canal. But the way it's built the speaker ends up about a centimeter outside the entrace to my ear hole, which makes it difficult to hear in scenarios where there's background noise You have to read a memorize the user manual to understand what the bizarre series of chirps and beeps this thing produces mean. Last night I used it and it was fine. This morning, after a full charge, I put it on to do my work-related conference call. Suddenly it starts making this chirping noise. It's trying to tell me something, but I have no idea what and I need to go look it up in the manual. Of course I'm about to hop on a conference call and I don't have time. So I just have to turn it off and take the call old-style: pressing the phone to my ear. What in the world is it complaining about? It has a full charge. My phone is fully charged. The connection to my phone is working fine. It's not on mute. The volume is up. What is the world could be wrong? I guess I'll find out once I find and look it up in the manual.

"This is a simple and effective alternative to having to buy a Nike+ shoe. It does keep the sensor securely in place as recommended for accuracy in your distance. I ran about a year with one before the top came off, losing the transmitter. I believe the part that locks it in place can't take long term stress. I recommend checking it periodically for signs of stress. If you want a pouch type, make sure it keeps it secure with no extra movement. This is required for maximum accuracy.",neutral

"I've been using this headset for about 2 weeks now and haven't had any problems with it yet. The volume is definitely loud enough to hear people on the other end, which is good since the another wired headset I have is much too soft. But it could almost use a slightly lower setting since when in a quiet room the lowest setting is slightly louder than I would prefer, but it is still a comfortable volume. People on the other end say that I sound fine and don't notice that I'm on a headset, but one person did say they noticed and I didn't sound as good. The headset hasn't had any problems connecting to my phone. The power button is a little hard to press, as others have mentioned. But as long as I turn it on before putting it on my ear, I have no problem. It takes a couple seconds to get it on my ear, so I've missed a couple calls since I couldn't get it on in time. Despite the little drawbacks, I think it is a great quality headset with excellent voice and sound quality, which is the reason I bought it.",positive
Great for one or two rooms.,neutral
"Got an email asking for a review the same day I got it. I can't really be sure if it works or not, the instructions were all in Japanese and the phone didn't seem to be in the package. I tried to put my old home, corded phone into the case that they did manage to send but it didn't quite fit and I don't see how it plugs into the home phone. I will try to send a wire into the bottom part from the corded phone but then I don't know where I will go to get phone calls for the rest of the day. Amazon?",negative
Just as described.,positive
"I purchased a pair of these for my wife and myself. After about a week of use I would say this product did not live up to my expectations. Pros: Sound quality on both sides was great. It also did a very nice job of canceling out background noise while driving in the car. Set up was a breeze. Cons: The battery was supposed to give me 13 hours of talk time. Both my wife and myself experienced closer to 2 hours. My wife also had trouble with spotty connection issues. I did not personally experience this, but it happened to her often enough during the first week that I though I should include it in my review. Overall I would not recommend this product.",negative
"They don't hold a charge for any length of time. They will charge but almost any use of the phone causes them to discharge. No choice, phone company doesn't carry any batteries. Went back to original ones, they last longer.",negative
"The case is well made, but I guess I was a little rough on the belt clip. This case comes with a really nice belt clip that has a flap that actually clips over the belt clip, making sure this case does not come off your belt. It is a rather ingenious little design, However, After about 2 months, the flap detached at the seam, and then the piece of leather sewn to the pouch to hold the belt clip in place, came off. Basically leaving the case useless for wearing on a belt. I bought this becasue the $25 case I bought with the phone began to wear out and the metal rivet holding the belt clip on to the case began to chaffe the touch screen on my phone. It was way too late for my phone (cosmetically) before i realized what was happening. So I bought this case through Amazon. It was very inexpensive, but did not last me very long.",neutral
The product is just as shown. Just make sure that you don't need a micro-usb cable. This cable is a mini-usb cable. I made that mistake with my blackberry.,positive
"Initially the phone worked fine until 5 months later. Without dropping the phone (which Verizon accused me of) the screen turned black. For $50 I received the same model replacement phone. This 2nd phone gave me problems 6 months later with call reception. I either couldn't hear the caller or the caller was coming in and out. After much complaints to Verizon, they exchanged my phone with another one (same model). Now this 3rd phone is giving me problems also. The reception is fine, but now no one can hear me. My voice comes thorough very low, faint, and with the complaints from my friends that I sound like I'm far away. I have had it with this phone and with verizon. Very poor customer service and handling of this problem. I can't wait for my contract to be up.",negative
Arrived on time. Work great!,positive
"The hinge doesn't hold itself in place like the photograph shows. I have to keep mine at a much higher angle because the shower head is so heavy. When it gets weighed down it collapses suddenly, so then the head sprays at the wall instead of at me.",neutral
"This is an address book? It gives you a separate listing, or line, for each phone number. No addresses or notes. So if your contact has four #s, you get four separate listings. Phone numbers are listed by first name then last name. That's it, not filed by last name first. Hey, we're not all in high school where we look up our contacts by their first name. No memory card. So if you have more phone #s than the phone's memory (I think it's 1000 or 2000 #s), just cull them out, because they won't fit on your phone. Unless all your numbers are on the SIM card (rather than phone memory), which limits it now to 100 or 250 #s depending on the SIM card, no way you're gonna get speed dial to work. The font used by the phone is a throwback to a decade or more ago. Not pretty to read. The alarm clock is a pain to use. You can set five alarm clocks, and I like the eight minute snooze, but you must reset the alarm each day, and it takes a few steps.",negative
"For me the sound quality is by far the most important factor when I compare headsets. Everything else is secondary. I drive a very noisy construction van so background noise is a serious problem. I have compared 8 different headsets and the Plantronics Voyager 510 is the only one that allows a clear conversation in this environment. I have used it daily for over 2 years and often for 6+ hours straight until the battery is dead. In a loud, dirty, construction environment, often lying on the ground, it's the only thing I've found that works. With the other models, either I, the caller, or both of us couldn't understand a word being said. For those of you that don't have background noise issues, I can add that even in quiet settings this unit has better sound quality than all the others that I tested. The way that I do my tests is to pair 2 headsets, put one in each ear and then switch between them while on the same call. This way I and the caller can compare the sound quality at almost the exact same time. The 2 cons I can mention are that the on/off button is too small and hard to push, and that when the battery is almost dead the buttons stop working (even though the sound continues fine) so you have to hang up using the phone instead of the headset. To be fair though, the ""almost dead battery"" symptoms happen in many of the other ones I've tested also. I don't care, sound is everything.",positive
"I have owned every bluetooth earpiece known to man. They ALL left a lot to be desired in regard to sound and voice quality...until the Jawbone. This bluetooth ""rocks"" in regard to sound and voice capabilities. Now to the down side...yes there is a major down side. My first Jawbone simply fell apart after only 3 months and no one would give me a discount on a new one so I went ahead and spend the $$$ for a new one (hoping mine was simply defective). Nope, not my luck....was extra careful with the new one because now I'm adicted to this thing in my ear but to no avail...second one fell apart as did the first. I hear the latest version is constructed much better....it damned sure better be...Jawbone is into me for $200 and I don't have one that works! I'll end up spending the $120 for the new one because the sound and voice is just THAT good...I may take the advice of other on here and just glue this one into my ear permanently. WOuld be nice if Jawbone new a little something about customer service though. It is only a matter of time before a REAL company comes out with a device that competes on the quality front and I will never buy another Jawbone....can't wait for that day, I hate companies that don't care about their customers!",neutral

"I just received this battery today, so not much else i can say other than it is pretty much exactly as it was described. The one thing i can say i'm quite pleased and relieved about is that the battery door that shipped seems to be solidly held in place. Unlike the other people who reviewed this item, my battery door does not fall off, nor does it seem it would fall off even if i dropped the phone. Maybe the seller saw these reviews and improved the doors since, but mine is flawless. My only initial dissapointment is that the battery does add significant weight and size to the phone. Since i just received it today, i haven't really had much experience in taking the phone places to see if it's going to be that much more of an inconvinience, so that remains to see, but i'm optimistic. I am happy to report, however, that the battery's life is a huge improvement over my factory battery that shipped with the phone over 2 years ago that only holds about a 1 hour (talk time) charge. I've already used this battery for 3 hours and only went down to about 65% - AWESOME!",positive
"This is a near perfect device for those of us who are on the road a good deal and want a good solid phone, along with easy access and setup of my Outlook/Exchange email. If you want a hassle free phone/email device, this is it. I've used 2 other Windows-based devices, but Treo has improved the interface quite a bit. I'd highly recommend it.",positive

"I bought 2 of these ear pieces. Mine works fine, but my girlfriend's doesn't work at all. I plan on returning it and getting another one because I like the small size and the easy set up of the Cardo 700. I upgraded from the Cardo 500 that I bought in March of 2007 (I still use it to this day- a great buy) and the 500 has worked through all sorts of weather and conditions (I'm a police officer and a member of the Air National Guard.) All in all, if you get one that works, it's great.",neutral
"The base technology as deployed in the original Jawbone is the best noise canceling system on any headset. However the system requires a sensor on the headset be in contact with you face (just above your jawbone). Some people felt the original was too big and heavy and so this model is much smaller and lighter. However while re-engineering the unit reduced size / weight, it now has a major problem with fit. It's uncomfortable to wear for extended periods, is easily dropped and critically the reduced mass means it flops around and loses the face contact required to make the core technology work. Very disappointing product. If it happens to fit you well it's may be fine but I personally know several Jawbone I users who ""upgraded"" to this unit only too dump it if favor of the old Jawbone I or abandon Jawbone entirely angry to have paid top dollar for such a poorly executed headset.",negative
"I purchased the Garmin GDB 55 mainly so I could have traffic reports as I try to make my way to and from work every day. The service is S L O W (anywhere from 10 - 25 minutes for traffic to start registering) and spotty (entire sections of freeways are contantly missing). I used to have traffic through XM Satellite and it was MUCH quicker and complete. I do not recommend MSN for this service. All other services seem OK, but that's not why I purchased the equipment.",neutral
"I've owned this Plantronics Calisto Pro cordless phone for about 6 months. It's my 3rd cordless phone which I use at the office on a daily basis. Here's a concise summary of the pros and cons based on my experience: Pros: 1. Very comfortably headset; 2. Easy to charge both headset and handset; 3. Great lighted LCD display; 4. Handset stays connected to the base at a good distance; 5. Headset stays connected to the handset for up to approx. 30 feet; 6. Very good sound quality; 7. Easy to adjust the volume while speaking. Cons: 1. Headset disconnects unexpectedly (hanging up on the caller, approximately every 30th call); 2. Small buttons which are tough to read (even though they are lighted); 3. Limited instruction manual; 4. Annoying to hang-up phone (either pressing a small button on the side of the headset or pressing the tough to find button on the handset). I spoke with a technician at Plantronics regarding the headset disconnection problem. He was minimally helpful, instructing me to re-link the headset and base (even though they are only a few feet apart when it disconnects), which only corrected the problem temporarily. Overall, it's a good phone with many pros and some significant cons, at a very significant price. My conclusion is that I would not buy this phone again, but will continue to use it for now.",neutral
Very pleased with the sound quality and ease of use. The plastic arm that wraps around your neck will crack if abused.,neutral
Thank you for the quick delivery. I like car windshield mount holder. The price is very reasonable inexpensive and very satisfy for the price i paid. I strongly recommend this for other to purchase.,positive
It does everything it says it will do. I'm happy with the audio quality but there's no detent in the design of the plug to hold it in the itouch or ipod. it works well for recording but my $400.00 itouch looks pretty trashy with a rubber band around it holding the microphone in place.,neutral
"UPDATE: I used this for a few months in a van, then lost the van to a fallen tree. This charger went into storage and only came out for a camping trip (I use a car battery/solar system for charging and running a fan). After a week of use, this unit failed completely. It no longer provides power to any of the 4 ports. The fuse is intact. Overall, I would say I used this device for maybe 30 days in total, spread out over a year. Note: The fuse was VERY hard to get out. OLD REVIEW FOLLOWS I can't really think of anything negative to say here. After reading all the reviews, I chose this and am glad I did. Notice that this has a large amp outlet, which some equipment will require. In my case I needed to extend the cord* on a mini-fridge and the average 12 v car socket/adapter can't handle the amperage of a compressor. Also note that the USB chargers work fine. Some people say they don't work, but they do. The worst-case scenario is that they may charge a bit slower than your desktop computer but they WILL charge. Look, if you're going on a long car ride, this will charge your phone, I don't care what kind of phone you have. Yes, if you are trying to charge a high drain device, or a device with long battery life (i.e., a tablet) then the USB ports may amount to a trickle charge...but they WILL charge, regardless of whether your i-Whatever tells you ""Not charging."" This is a lie--it is charging. If that is a problem for you then it is easily solved by using the 12v converter and the correct household AC plug in charger--i.e., don't use the provided USB port. I really liked the option of mounting this based on the design--you can use screws or just use velcro tape. But that wasn't necessary in my case. * I could have spliced the wires, but I needed additional outlets anyway, as this is a '94 van with 7 seats but only 2 outlets (everybody didn't own 5 devices back then).",negative
I have used this case for three years and it has held up great. Only until recently the top cover started to come loose which can be glued. I chose to use some left over black suede from a school project to recover it instead.,positive
The Itorch has performed above expectations. The external battery will charge all of my equipment during my 2 to 3 day travel with no issues. Including a IPhone 5 and my IPad. It has been extremely convenient and easy to use. A plus to the Itorch is the LED light & laser. I actually utilized the light in the hotel parking garage to find my dropped room key.,positive
"My wife wanted this case and the problem she keeps having is trying to get the case to fit together nicely. When you put the 2 pieces together one side will go together flush but the other side will be off a little, I tried everything to get it on right but it just wont. other then that is a nice little box but i don't think it offers much drop protection for the glass itself.",neutral
Many of the reviews here are giving this low scores because it isn't working with a particular phone/computer/av device - which is unfair to the product. The issue is with the devices not the headphones. Even when a manufacturer puts all of the proper bluetooth protocols in a phone - often your wireless carrier disables them so as not to compete with other devices that they are hawking. I am using this with an LG VX8300 cell phone and it works perfectly in every sense. Hi-Fi audio automatically gets paused for answering an incoming phone call. Incoming and outgoing sound is crystal clear. It is a little heavy and has the silly blue lights on it - the weight was probably required to get 14hrs of play time on a charge though.,positive
This works fine with my motorala S stereo headset - but will not pair with my mono Planatronics or soyo headset.,neutral
"I purchased 2 of these and they both suffered the same fate: a broken belt clip. The belt clip snapped off when I bumped the holster (bound to happen when you're wearing it on your side). The case itself is great, love that it allows the pearl to recognize that it's in the holster, but to me is worthless without a sturdier clip. For what it's worth, the seller is great it's just the product that isn't.",negative
